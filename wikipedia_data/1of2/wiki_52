One World Trade Center

One World Trade Center (also known as One WTC or Freedom Tower) is the main building of the new World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan, New York City. The building is tall making it the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. Since late 2013, it is the tallest building in the United States. It opened in late 2014. It is mostly used for offices. People can view the city from an observatory near the top. The building was designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.

The building has the same name as the North Tower of the original World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The building was built on the spot where the original 6 World Trade Center used to be.

Construction for the building started in 2006. On April 30, 2012, One World Trade Center became New York City's tallest structure, when it surpassed the height of the Empire State Building. On May 10, 2013, the last piece of the skyscraper's antenna was put on, making the building's height 1,776 feet (541 m). The height of the building was done on purpose to refer to the year when the Declaration of Independence was signed, 1776.

On March 26, 2009, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) said that the building would be officially known by its legal name of "One World Trade Center", rather than its colloquial name of "Freedom Tower". The building has 94 stories, with the top floor numbered 104.

The new World Trade Center complex will have five high-rise office buildings built. The National September 11 Memorial & Museum, located just south of One World Trade Center where the original Twin Towers stood, was also built. The construction of the new building is part of an effort to memorialize and rebuild following the destruction of the original World Trade Center complex.

On November 8, 2013, architects in Chicago and New York City began debating about the height of the One World Trade Center and the Willis Tower. They were saying that there was a possibility that the Willis Tower is taller than the One World Trade Center.

On November 12, a committee agreed that the antenna on top is part of the building, so One World Trade Center is taller than the Willis Tower.

Even after removing the antennas from the measurement, One World Trade Center is about 325 feet (99 m) taller than the Willis Tower.

Fashion design

Fashion design is the art and profession of designing clothes, costume and related items like hats, purses, bags and shoes.

Fashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as attractive. They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn. They have a range of materials to work with and a wide range of colors, patterns and styles to choose from. 

Some clothes are made specifically for an individual, as in the case of haute couture or bespoke tailoring. Today, most clothing is designed for the mass market, especially casual and every-day wear.

Fashion design started in the 19th century with Charles Frederick Worth, who was the first designer to have his label sewn into the garments he created. Worth's success was such that he was able to dictate to his customers what they should wear, instead of following their lead as earlier dressmakers had done. The term "couturier" was in fact first created in order to describe him. While all articles of clothing from any time period are studied by academics as costume design, only clothing created after 1858 is considered fashion design.

During this period many design houses began to hire artists to sketch or paint designs for garments. The images were shown to clients, which was much cheaper than producing an actual sample garment in the workroom. If the client liked their design, they ordered it and the resulting garment made money for the house. Thus, the tradition of designers sketching out garment designs began as an economy.

The garments produced by clothing manufacturers fall into three main categories, although these may be split up into additional, more specific categories

Until the 1950s, fashion clothing was predominately designed and manufactured on a made-to-measure or haute couture basis. Each garment was made for a specific client. A couture garment is made to order for an individual customer, and is usually made from high-quality, expensive fabric, sewn with extreme attention to detail and finish, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Look and fit take priority over the cost of materials and the time it takes to make. Due to the high cost of each garment, haute couture makes little direct profit for the fashion houses, but is important for prestige and publicity.

Ready-to-wear clothes have elements of haute couture and mass market. They are not made for individual customers, but great care is taken in the choice and cut of the fabric. Clothes are made in small quantities to guarantee exclusivity, so they are rather expensive. Ready-to-wear collections are usually presented by fashion houses each season during a period known as Fashion Week. This takes place on a city-wide basis and occurs twice a year. The main seasons of Fashion Week include, spring/summer, fall/winter, resort, swim, and bridal.

Currently the fashion industry relies more on mass market sales. The mass market caters for a wide range of customers, producing ready-to-wear garments using trends set by the famous names in fashion. They often wait around a season to make sure a style is going to catch on before producing their own versions of the original look. In order to save money and time, they use cheaper fabrics and simpler production techniques which can easily be done by machine. The end product can therefore be sold much more cheaply.

Word search

A word search is a puzzle that uses words and puts them in a grid. The point of the game is to find all of the words hidden in the grid.

The puzzle consists of a grid of letters that is usually a rectangle or square shape, but different shapes are possible, some that even look like an object like a plant or animal. Besides the grid is a list of words. The letters in the word appear in order somewhere in the grid, and can be placed horizontally, vertically or diagonally. A letter in the grid can be used in more than one word, and not all the letters in the grid have to appear in a word.

To solve the puzzle, a person has to find the place where each word is hidden in the grid, and when he or she finds that place, he or she circles all the letters in the word (as shown in the example), and then crosses the word off the list so that he or she knows not to look for that word again. It is easier to find the bigger words first since they have more letters.

Many word search puzzles have a theme, so all the hidden words are related. Sometimes, once all the words have been found, the letters which have not been used in any of the words (that is, the letters which have not been circled at least once) spell another word or even a short message. An example of a word search with both a theme and a word made up of unused letters is .

Like other puzzles, word searches are commonly found in newspapers and magazines, which print a different puzzle every day and show the solution in another place or in the next issue. There are also books containing collections of these puzzles, and they can also be played over the Internet or using mobile apps.

When he comes back, his personality is changed and Amy thinks that Ben slept or fell in love with someone else. When she asks Ben if he fell in love in Italy, he says no but Amy thinks he's lying, and she thinks Adrianne might know whether he is telling the truth or not. This makes Amy's hate Adrianne more.

In recent times this song been sampled by several R&B artists, as well as hitting the charts again as a remix by UK Hardcore Rave pranksters/genii Altern-8 in 1991.

Gooding was born in New York City. He has four children, including actors Cuba Gooding, Jr. (born 1968) and Omar Gooding (born 1976).

Gooding was found dead in his car on the afternoon of April 20, 2017 in Woodland Hills, California, aged 72. Police believe he died from a suspected drug overdose.

Alexander Pope

Alexander Pope (21 May 1688 O.S. – 30 May 1744) is usually thought of as the greatest English poet in the eighteenth century. He is best known for his satirical writing and for his translation of Homer. He is the third most often quoted writer in "The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations", after Shakespeare and Tennyson. Pope was a master of the heroic couplet.

Alfred, Lord Tennyson

Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson, FRS (6 August 1809 – 6 October 1892) was Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom in the Victorian era. He remains one of the most popular poets in the English language.

Tennyson was excellent at writing short lyrics like "In the valley of Cauteretz", "Break, break, break", "The Charge of the Light Brigade", "Tears, idle tears" and "Crossing the Bar". Much of his verse like The Lotus Eaters was based on classical mythological themes. Tennyson also wrote some notable blank verse including "Idylls of the King", "Ulysses", and "Tithonus". During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays were not very successful.

"In Memoriam A.H.H." was a poem by Tennyson, written in memory of his best friend Arthur Hallam. Hallam was a fellow poet and classmate at Trinity College, Cambridge. He had been engaged to Tennyson's sister, but died from a cerebral hemorrhage before they could get married.

The poem was published after Tennyson had read a pro-evolution book by Robert Chambers. The fundamentalist idea of Biblical inerrancy was in conflict with science. Tennyson expressed the difficulties evolution raised for faith in "the truths that never can be proved".

The poem is too long to quote in full, but this shows how he was thinking of the living world:

The much-quoted phrase comes soon after, in section 56. It refers to humanity: 
The phrase "Nature, red in tooth and claw" was taken up as a metaphor for life in general, even before Darwin's "Origin of species" was published.

The poem has another, perhaps even better-known stanza:

Rheumatic fever

Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that happens in children and young adults as a result of becoming infected by group A streptococci bacteria. The first attack usually happens between the ages of 5 and 15. It affects the heart, skin, joints and the central nervous system. It is most common in the Middle East, eastern Europe, South America and the Far East and is rare in western Europe and North America. Treatment includes resting in bed and antibiotics.

Wolfgang Mozart, the famous composer famously died of rheumatic fever.

The Main Ingredient

The Main Ingredient is an American soul and R&B group best known for their 1972 hit song, "Everybody Plays the Fool".

Secondhand Serenade

Secondhand Serenade is an American rock/emo solo project started by John Vesley. Vesley is the singer, guitarist and pianoplayer. Secondhand Serenade is most famous for the song "Fall For You". This song was in the top 40 for many charts.

Edward Downes

Sir Edward Downes, (born Birmingham, England, 17 June 1924; died Switzerland, 10 July 2009) was an English conductor. He was famous for conducting opera, but also conducted orchestral concerts. He worked a lot with the orchestra of the Royal Opera House as well as Opera Australia.

When he was old he was almost totally blind and deaf and his wife was dying of cancer, so they both decided that they wanted to die together. They went to Switzerland where they were allowed to commit assisted suicide.

Downes was born in Birmingham, England. His father worked in a bank. He left school when he was 14 and got a simple job in a gas store where he earned 16s 10d (16 shillings and 10 pence, which is 84p in modern British money) a week. 

He had been playing the piano and violin since he was five. When he was 16 he got a scholarship to the University of Birmingham where he studied English literature and music, and began playing the cor anglais. He then got a scholarship to study conducting at the University of Aberdeen.

In the 1960s, he married Joan, a dancer with the Royal Ballet. She later became a choreographer and television producer. They had two children: a son, Caractacus (born December 1967), who became a musician and recording engineer, and a daughter, Boudicca, who became a video producer.

In 1952 he started his work in the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden where he was assistant to Rafael Kubelík. He worked for the ROH for 17 years, becoming Associate Music Director in 1991. 

From 1970 he was Music Director of Australian Opera. He conducted the first performance in the new Sydney Opera House in 1973 conducting Prokofiev’s opera "War and Peace". He was Chief Conductor of the Netherlands Radio Orchestra and the BBC Philharmonic.

Downes was remembered in particular for conducting music by British composers. He was also especially fond of the operas by Verdi as well as the symphonies of Shostakovich. People often thought he looked like Shostakovich, especially when he wore his glasses.

He received the honour of CBE.

In his last years he could hardly see and so he could only conduct music that he knew from memory.

When he was 85 he had become almost totally blind and deaf. His wife was dying of cancer and was in a lot of pain. They both wanted to die together, but in Britain it is against the law to help someone to die, so they decided to go to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. There, surrounded by members of their family, they drank a fatal dose of barbiturates and died on 10 July 2009.

Some people who support the idea of assisted suicide are hoping that this case may lead to more discussion which could bring about a change in the law in Britain and other countries.

Assisted suicide

Assisted suicide is when somebody who wants to commit suicide (wants to die) is helped to do this by someone else. Normally, people who ask for assisted suicide are very ill and in a lot of pain, so they want someone to help them to die, for example by being given access to drugs which will kill them. Some people prefer the terms aid in dying or death with dignity to describe assisted suicide. The term euthanasia is sometimes used, although euthanasia is generally regarded as different to assisted suicide, as it involves causing a person to die rather than helping them to kill themselves.

The law about this varies a lot in different countries. In many countries it is not allowed, and the person who helps someone to die may be arrested and sent to prison. Physician-assisted suicide is legal in some countries, under certain circumstances, including Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, 10 states of the United States and all six states of Australia. In general to make it legal the person who wants to die has to show that they are of sound mind, voluntarily and repeatedly expressing their wish to die, and take the specified, lethal dose by their own hand. In 2024 several other countries are talking about making this legal. Jersey and the Isle of Man considering this puts pressure on the United Kingdom to do the same. 

Some people who are very ill and want to die may go to these countries, such as Switzerland, in order to end their life.

Dignitas (Swiss non-profit organisation)

Dignitas is a Swiss group that helps people with assisted suicide. This means that, if a person is very ill and wants to die, the doctors and nurses help them to end their life. Only people who have a terminal illness or very bad physical or mental illnesses are allowed to be helped. The patients must be able to understand what is happening and decide for themselves that death is what they want.

Dignitas was started in 1998 by Ludwig Minelli, a Swiss lawyer. The law in Switzerland says that someone can help in an assisted suicide so long as they do not have any self-interest (for example, so long as they are not going to inherit money from the person who dies). The doctor has to meet the person on two occasions and make sure that the person really does wish to die. There must be evidence for this, i.e. the patient has to sign a paper, and two witnesses have to sign to say they saw the patient signing. If the patient is too ill to sign, a video film can be made. The patient is asked several times whether that is what they want. If everyone is absolutely sure, then he or she is given a drug which will kill them.

Some people travel from other countries such as Britain to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland so that they can be helped to die. For example, the rugby player Daniel James, who was 23, had a terrible injury to his spine which left him paralysed from his chest down, travelled there with his parents to die. In 2009 the British conductor Edward Downes and his wife both travelled to Dignitas where they died together.


Euthanasia

Euthanasia is when a person's life is purposely ended because of disease or pain, which has made them suffer. This is different from assisted suicide, where a person helps someone kill themselves. It is also different to murder, where the reason is not suffering, but to kill for the killer's own ends. Euthanasia can be voluntary, where the person who dies asks for help in ending their life. Where the person is unable to make their decision known, it is usually called "non-voluntary euthanasia". Where someone is killed against their will, it is usually called murder.

Euthanasia is illegal in most countries. It is permitted in a small number of countries, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Victoria, Australia. The New Zealand Parliament voted 69 - 51 to pass the End of Life choice Bill. In Is it Time to Kill the Kiwi the Rt Hon Simeon Brown said international precedents show that euthanasia regimes result in the involuntary death of innocent lives, often those who are marginalized and vulnerable. The final decision will be made in a binding public referendum. Where it is permitted there are many rules, and only in cases where the patient is terminally ill. Though euthanasia is not legal in the United States, doctors can assist people to kill themselves. This is legal in Washington, Oregon, and Montana. Physician Assisted Suicide (PAD) is different to euthanasia; it is about who gives the medication to end a patient’s life. The World Federation of Right to Die Societies says physician-assisted suicide means "making lethal means available to the patient to be used at a time of the patient’s own choosing." In these cases the patient takes the legal dose of poison themselves, it is not given by the doctor. It is euthanasia when the doctor has the main role in ending the patient’s life by giving the poison. 

Euthanasia can be active or passive, and voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary. Many people see important differences and they can accept some types but not others.

Passive euthanasia means letting a person die. A terminally ill person is allowed to die, even if treatment could help them to live longer. This includes removing life support, such as a ventilator which is being used to keep the person alive, or by not giving them food or water. Active euthanasia means doing something to end a person's life. This could be giving them an injection or pills that will cause their death.

Some people see passive euthanasia as a more acceptable choice, because it is not a deliberate act to kill. However, others argue that once someone has decided to allow another person to die, they should make it as fast and as painless as possible, and then act to bring about their death. This is also known as mercy killing.

Voluntary euthanasia is when someone asks to be allowed to die or to be killed. This is often seen as the best option by people who believe in euthanasia, because it is clear that the person wants to die. If the person can not say that they want to die, but people think that they would ask to die if they could, then it is "non-voluntary euthanasia." Non-voluntary euthanasia is a choice for people who are in a coma or who are very young, as they can not say what they want. "Involuntary euthanasia" is when someone is killed even though they asked not to die, or when they could have asked to die but did not. Many people think that this is murder, not euthanasia.

These types of euthanasia can be mixed. If someone asks to die, and another person gives them an injection that will kill them, then it is active voluntary euthanasia. Someone in a coma who is kept alive with a ventilator, and the doctors turn it off and they die, would be passive non-voluntary euthanasia.

Some people believe that euthanasia should be allowed, and some people think that it should not.

Some people believe that allowing euthanasia will result in bad things happening. If it is allowed for people asking to die, then it might be allowed for people who are very sick but are not able to ask to die. If that happens, then maybe it would be allowed for people who are very sick and will not recover, but do not want to die. This is called the "slippery slope" argument. 

People who believe in the slippery slope argument point to times when this happened. In Germany, Adolf Hitler allowed disabled children to be killed, and called it euthanasia. People now agree that this was wrong, but if euthanasia was allowed it could happen again. They think it is too big a risk to allow euthanasia at all.

Other people say there is a big difference between killing a very sick person who asks to die, and killing a child with a disability. They do not think euthanasia will lead to bad things. They say that Hitler's actions were not euthanasia.

The American Medical Association (AMA) and other doctors believe it is a doctor's role to help, not kill people. In one study 76% of doctors said they would not carry out euthanasia, even if it was legal. They feel patients would not trust them. In the Netherlands where euthanasia is legal, 60% of older people in one study were scared that their doctors would kill them.

Palliative care is when people who are ill and going to die are given special care to make them more comfortable. It may include hospice care, when the patient is sent to a special hospital for people who are dying. Palliative care can involve pain relief and help for the patient and family to come to terms with death. In some cases, doctors will give patient drugs which make them stay asleep, so that they will not feel pain.

Palliative care is not perfect, and so it is not always seen as a replacement for euthanasia. There is still some pain, and there can be other side-effects, where the patient can still feel very sick. Palliative care is not available for all people, and not all people who wish to die through euthanasia are so sick that they will die soon. Some people have healthy bodies, but they are suffering in other ways, and palliative care will not always help them.

The principle of double effect was first described by Thomas Aquinas over 700 years ago. It says that it is sometimes alright to do a bad thing if something good happens, and if a bad ending was not wanted. Aquinas used the example of self defense: sometimes a person will kill someone who attacks them, but killing was not what the person was trying to do. They only wanted to protect themselves. So even though killing someone is bad, wanting to protect themselves was not.

Some people say that doctors may treat a person to reduce their pain, and as a result the person will die sooner. If the doctor gives the treatment in order to help the patient die, then it is euthanasia. But if the doctor gives the treatment in order to stop the pain, and does not intend for the patient to die, then it may not be euthanasia, even if the doctor knew that the treatment would kill the patient.

Suicide is when a person kills themselves. Sometimes when a person is very sick they need help to die, and this is called assisted suicide. In some countries people are allowed to help as long as they do not kill the person, and it can be seen as a more acceptable option because it must be the person's own decision. Because the assisting person did not kill, it is not always considered to be euthanasia. 


Terminal illness

Terminal illness is a term used to describe an illness which cannot be cured and will almost definitely end in the death of the patient. The term is mostly used for progressive diseases such as cancer or advanced heart disease. Someone who has a terminal illness may be described as a terminal patient or as being terminally ill. Usually a patient is called "terminally ill" when they are not expected to live more than 6 months. Medical conditions such as AIDS are not called terminal illnesses because the patient may live for many years before eventually dying of the illness.

Very often, terminally ill patients are given palliative care to give them a better quality of life. Sometimes, they go to a hospice to be looked after.

Ralph Downes

Ralph William Downes CBE KSG (born Derby, 16 August 1904; died London, 24 December 1993) was an English organist and organ designer.

He was assistant organist at Southwark Cathedral from 1923 until 1925. Then he continued his education at Keble College, Oxford. He was music director and organist of the new chapel at Princeton University between 1928 and 1935. During his time in America he learned a lot about organ building and listened to musicians playing baroque music.

He soon became famous for his recitals and radio broadcasts in which he played music using historical performance styles. He gave first performances of pieces by composers such as Darius Milhaud, Paul Hindemith and Arnold Schoenberg. Benjamin Britten invited him every year to perform at the Aldeburgh Festival.

In 1948, he was asked to design an organ for the new Royal Festival Hall. When the organ was first played in 1954 not everyone agreed that it was good, but soon it was realised that it was an excellent instrument for playing music from the Baroque and Classical music periods and it had a big influence on the way that other organs were built. 

Downes was Professor of Organ at the Royal College of Music from 1954 to 1975 and was the best known British organ teacher of his day. His students included Gillian Weir and Trevor Pinnock. He made many recordings and wrote a book about organ design.

He was given the honour of CBE in 1969. He died in London in 1993. There was no organ music at his funeral. Instead, he had asked for Gregorian chant to be sung.

Symmetry (biology)

Symmetry in biology is about the overall shape of the body and its parts. The body plans of most multicellular organisms have some form of symmetry, radial symmetry, bilateral symmetry or spherical symmetry. A few have no symmetry, and are asymmetric. 

In nature and biology, symmetry is approximate. For example, plant leaves, which are more or less symmetrical, will rarely match up exactly when folded in half.

There are three basic forms:


In nature and biology, symmetry is approximate. For example, plant leaves, while considered symmetric, will rarely match up exactly when folded in half.


William Morris

William Morris (24 March 1834 – 3 October 1896) was an English wallpaper, furniture and fabric designer, artist, writer, and socialist. He was born in Walthamstow in North East London.
Morris was educated at Marlborough and Exeter College, Oxford. In 1856, he became an apprentice to Gothic revival architect G. E. Street but his apprenticeship lasted only about eigth months; thus he never qualified as an architect. That year he founded the "Oxford and Cambridge Magazine". In 1861, Morris founded a design firm in partnership with the artist Edward Burne-Jones, and the poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. This had a great impact on the decoration of churches and houses in the early 20th century. Morris's major contribution was as a designer of repeating patterns for wallpapers and textiles. This was mainly based on a close observation of nature. He was also a major contributor to the resurgence of traditional textile arts and methods of production.

Morris wrote and published poetry, fiction, and translations of ancient and medieval texts throughout his life, among others "Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs" (1876). His best-known works include "The Defence of Guenevere and Other Poems" (1858), "The Earthly Paradise" (1868–1870), "A Dream of John Ball" (1888) and the utopia "News form Nowhere" (1890). His poetry was strongly influenced by Geoffrey Chaucer's work. This influence can be seen in the use of rhyme royal.
William Morris designed his own furniture. He was frustrated, because he could not find any furniture he liked, so he decided, he wanted to design his own furniture, but it was mostly wallpaper designs.

Morris was an important person in the emergence of socialism in Great Britain. He founded the Socialist League in 1884. However, he broke with the movement over goals and methods by the end of that decade. He devoted much of the rest of his life to the Kelmscott Press, which he founded in 1891. The 1896 Kelmscott edition of the "Works of Geoffrey Chaucer" is considered a masterpiece of book design.


Cliveden

Cliveden is the name of a large house in Buckinghamshire near London, England. There have been three houses on this site. The first house was built in 1666 and burnt to the ground in a fire in 1795. A new house was built but this one also burnt down in a fire in 1849. The house which can be seen today was made in 1851 by Sir Charles Barry, an architect.

Cliveden means "valley among cliffs".

Cliveden House sits in a large garden and woodland, (375 acres). The garden contains many statues and fountains made from stone as well as areas of flowers. Cliveden is very close to the River Thames.

Many famous and important people have lived at Cliveden. Some of these are:

The house is now used as a hotel.

Josef Krips

Josef Krips (born Vienna, 8 April 1902; died Geneva, 13 October 1974) was an Austrian conductor and violinist.

Krips was born into a Jewish family. He became a pupil of Eusebius Mandyczewski and Felix Weingartner. From 1921 to 1924, he was Weingartner's assistant at the Vienna Volksoper where he worked as repetiteur and chorus master. Afterwards he became conductor of several orchestras, including the orchestra in Karlsruhe from 1926 to 1933. In 1933 he returned to Vienna as conductor of the Volksoper. He also became a professor at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts in 1935. He often conducted at the Salzburg Festival between 1935 and 1938.

In 1938, when the Nazi's took power in Austria, (the Anschluss), Krips had to leave the country because he was Jewish and Roman Catholic. He worked in Belgrade until Yugoslavia also became involved in World War II. For the rest of the war he worked in a food factory.

In 1945 he went back to Austria, where he was one of the few conductors who were allowed to work, because he had not worked under the Nazi regime. He was the first person after the war to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic and the Salzburg Festival where he conducted Mozart's opera "Don Giovanni".

From 1950 to 1954 Krips was principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. Afterwards he conducted the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra and the San Francisco Symphony (from 1963 to 1970). He gave his first performance at Covent Garden in 1963 and appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in 1966. From then on he often conducted there. In 1970, he became conductor of the Deutsche Oper in Berlin. Between 1970 and 1973, he was the principal conductor of the Vienna Symphony Orchestra.

Krips died in Geneva, Switzerland in 1974.

His brother Henry was also a musician. He emigrated to Australia where he conducted the orchestra in Adelaide. Then he returned to London where he often conducted Viennese light music.


Répétiteur

A Répétiteur is a musician who helps opera singers to learn their parts for an opera.

The word "Répétiteur" is a French word which comes from the verb "répéter" meaning: "to repeat". The meaning here is "to rehearse", because when a musician rehearses (practises) he will go over the music many times until he has learned it really well. The German word is Korrepetitor.

A répétiteur will be a very skilled musician. He will be an excellent pianist who can play music on the piano which is normally played by an orchestra. He will often be able to help the singer to get to know the music by singing another part that is going on at the same time. He will be able to help the singer with technical problems with their voice, and also with pronunciation and musical interpretation.

Some répétiteurs may go on to become famous conductors, e.g. Josef Krips, Howard Goodall, and Georg Solti.
In ballet, a répétiteur teaches the steps and interpretation of the roles to some or all of the company performing a dance.

Hamilton Harty

Sir Hamilton Harty (born Hillsborough, Co. Down, Ireland, 4 December 1879; died Brighton, 19 February 1941) was an Irish composer, conductor and accompanist. He is particularly remembered for his work in Manchester with the orchestra called The Hallé.

Harty was born in Northern Ireland, the fourth of ten children. His father was a church organist. He learned to play the viola, piano, and organ. When he was twelve he was organist at Magheracoll Church, County Antrim. He also had organist jobs at Belfast and Dublin. In 1900 he went to London where he was soon known as a composer and an excellent piano accompanist. In 1904 he married the singer Agnes Nicholls. For her he wrote a piece for soprano and orchestra called "Ode to a Nightingale".

He soon became known as a conductor, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra and, from 1920, The Hallé, which he made into one of the best orchestras in England.
He conducted works by many composers, some of whom were little known at the time: they included Bax, Sibelius, Berlioz, Moeran, Walton and Richard Strauss. He gave the first performance in England of Mahler’s Ninth Symphony.

Harty was knighted in 1925. He resigned from The Hallé in 1933 after there had been a lot of arguments. After that he mainly conducted in London, as well as in United States and Australia.

Harty composed many pieces during his early years, including "An Irish Symphony", a tone poem "With the Wild Geese", a "Violin Concerto", and "Ode to a Nightingale".

Harty was ill for the last five years of his life. He had a brain tumour. He was looked after by his secretary Olive Baguley, because he had separated from his wife. He died in Hove near Brighton.


Albert Coates

Albert Coates (born Saint Petersburg, 23 April 1882; died Cape Town, 11 December 1953) was an Anglo-Russian conductor and composer.

Coates was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, the youngest of seven sons of an English father and a Russian mother. 

He studied at the conservatory in Leipzig, where his greatest teacher was Arthur Nikisch. He worked at the opera house in Dresden, and became conductor at Saint Petersburg's Mariinsky Theatre. After the Russian Revolution and World War I he just managed to escape from Russia in April 1919.

He first appeared at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1914 conducting Richard Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde". He was a man with a lot of energy, and he introduced the audiences to a lot of music they had not heard, especially by Russian composers such as Alexander Scriabin, but also English music by Ralph Vaughan Williams, Arnold Bax and Gustav Holst, whose suite "The Planets" he gave the first complete London public performance.

In the 1920s and early 1930s he often worked with the London Symphony Orchestra. He made gramophone recordings in the very early days of the gramophone. These include Scriabin's "Poème de l'Extase" and many bits from Wagner's "Der Ring des Nibelungen" and (in 1925) the complete "Symphony No. 9" of Beethoven. He was the conductor for the first recording of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3, with Vladimir Horowitz as soloist. 

In 1925 he gave the first stage performance outside Russia of Rimsky-Korsakov's opera "The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya".

He composed several works including operas and a symphonic poem "The Eagle", dedicated to the memory of his former teacher Artur Nikisch, which was performed in Leeds in 1925. In 1946 he settled in Milnerton, Cape Town, South Africa, where he died in 1953.

Albert Coates was no relation to Eric Coates, the English composer of light music, nor to the tenor John Coates.

Zango (used to be 180solutions) was a controversial software company founded in 1999. It went out of business after a British company called blinkx bought it. It was controversial for installing adware, or a type of software that displayed ads without your permission, on your computer.

Tropical Storm Alma

Tropical Storm Alma was a tropical cyclone in the 2008 Pacific hurricane season. It formed off the coast of Costa Rica on May 29. At first, it was forecast to be a weak storm, However, it quickly gained strength. It then hit land on Nicaragua. 

Alma was the first tropical storm to ever hit the Pacific coast of Nicaragua. Lots of rain from the storm caused flooding, and eleven people were killed in the area. The remains later became Tropical Storm Arthur in the Atlantic.


Herne Hill railway station

Herne Hill railway station is a train station in Herne Hill, a location in the London Borough of Lambeth, South London, England. Its location is . 

Transport for London has thought of making the Victoria line go to Herne Hill to give faster turnaround at the southern end of the line. The extension is not a high thing for TfL as it has a weaker business case than other projects.

The station is looked after by Southeastern train operating company. The off-peak service pattern is:


On Sunday, northbound Sutton Loop trains change between stopping at Blackfriars and Luton. Late-night Sutton loop services (21:57 onwards) run to Bedford from Monday-Saturday and finish at Blackfriars on Sunday.

First Capital Connect and Southeastern jointly have extra peak trains from Herne Hill to Beford (morning and evening peaks), Beckenham Junction Kent House, Rochester and Swanley (evening peak only).

Herne Hill has buses by London bus which routes are 3, 37 (24 hours), 68, 196, 201, 322, 468, N3 and N68. The nearest London Underground station is Brixton.

Sparkling wine

Sparkling wine is the name for a number of wines which have a lot of carbon dioxide in them. This will make the wine fizzy. The carbon dioxide may be the result of the fermentation process, or it may have been added later. One of the best-known examples is probably Champagne, but there are many other such wines. In Spain such wines are called "Cava", in Italy "Asti" or "Spumante" and in German "Sekt". In French the terms "Mousseux" or "Crémant" are used for such wines, as well, especially for those which are not produced in the Champagne. Crémant d'Alsace, Blanquette de Limoux and Clairette de Die are examples of sparkling wines made in France outside the Champagne region. 

Most sparkling wines are made from white wine or rosé.

Crémant d'Alsace

Crémant d'Alsace is a protected designation of origin for sparkling wines made in Alsace, France. 

A big part of the wine production in Alsace is used to make Crémant d'Alsace. About 18% of the region's vineyards used for this purpose. 223 942 hectoliter of Crémant d'Alsace, about 30 million bottles, were produced in 2006.

Crémant d'Alsace has been produced in Alsace since about 1900. Julien Dopff successfully tried to make wines using the "champagne method" then.


Clairette de Die

Clairette de Die is a kind of sweet white sparkling wine made from the Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains (75% minimum) and Clairette (25% maximum) grape varieties. It is produced in the Drôme department of France, in a part of the Rhône valley near the town of Die (pronounced "Dee"). The vineyards are some of the highest in France, between 400 and 700 metres above sea level. The region has a very long history of wine-growing, going back to Roman times.

The wine is bottle fermented. The muscat grapes which ripen first are kept separate from the clairette grapes. The grape juice is kept a low temperature, about 7°C, which means the fermentation will be slow and takes time. After filtering, but leaving some yeast the juice is blended in the bottle. It must be fermented in the bottle for at least another four months. The wine is then filtered again and put into new bottles for sale.

Blanquette de Limoux

Blanquette de Limoux is the name given to a number of sparkling wines from the Languedoc, in France. 

Blanquette de Limoux is probably the oldest known sparkling wine in France. 

According to a text at a local abbey, Livy praised the wines from Limoux, which were not sparkling wines at the time.

Benedictine monks of the abbey of Saint Hilaire found out how to make sparkling wine from white wine.

Dom Pérignon brought back the method of making sparkling wines to his abbey in Champagne, at the end of the 16th century. 

He started to experiment with it in the vineyards of the abbey.

Albert Goldfield

The Albert Goldfield is an area of 1300 square kilometres (500 square miles) where gold was discovered in the outback of New South Wales in 1880. Gold was found at Mount Browne, which is south west of Tibooburra. There were other finds at Good Friday, Easter Monday, Nuggerty, Pioneer Reef and Warratta Creek.

This is a very hot and dry area of Australia. Because of the shortage of water, towns were started at Milparinka and Tibooburra where there was water available. Towns at Albert and Mount Browne did not last for long because of the lack of water. By 1881 there were more than 2000 people living on the gold diggings or in the towns. Geologist William Henry John Slee was appointed resident Goldfield Warden. The miners had to either take their dirt to one of the towns to use water to pan for the gold, or use a method called dry blowing. Dry blowing means breaking the dirt into fine particles and letting the wind blow away the dirt leaving the heavier gold behind. Life on the goldfields was hard, water was scarce, fresh fruit and vegetables were not available, and basics like flour were very expensive. Disease, including dysentery and typhoid were common.

By 1893 the gold rush had ended and most people had left the goldfields.


Edward Bawden

Edward Bawden, , RA (10 March 1903 – 21 November 1989) was a British painter and an artist who drew pictures and graphics. He was also famous for his prints, book covers, posters, and metal garden furniture. During an interview, Edward Gorey said that Bawden was one of his trusted artists, making the fact interesting that not many people knew or know about this fine artist well.

Cross-City Line

The Cross-City Line is a suburban railway line in the West Midlands region of England. It runs from Redditch, Worcestershire, its southern terminus, to Lichfield, Staffordshire, its northern terminus. It goes through Birmingham New Street. It services on the line are currently operated by West Midlands Trains.

Book cover

A book cover is any protective covering used to bind together the pages of a book. The covering may be of paper, or hard paper boards, or even plastic. The boards may be covered with paper, cloth or leather. They may be laminated, with a plastic layer onto paper.

There is a distinction between hardbacks and softbacks, which are usually sold at different prices. Hardbacks may be covered with a dust jacket designed to attract readers. Softbacks are almost always designed to attract sales in bookshop displays.

The evolution of printing methods has made the production of books very much cheaper than was the case with early printed works. As a result, books are bought and read in great numbers. They compete against each other in the marketplace. The function of book design is partly to help the reader, but even more to persuade the reader to buy the book.

Lawn mower

A lawn mower (or lawnmower) is a machine that uses blades to cut a lawn. There are different types of lawn mowers. The smallest are pushed by a human, they are good for small lawns and gardens. Ride-on mowers are good for larger lawns. The largest are pulled behind a tractor, they are made for grass at places like golf courses, parks, and even fields. Always wear safety equipment while working with these machines.

A lawn mower functions by spinning either a thin blade or a small piece of cable, to cause "lacerations" on the stems of grass & other plants. Severing the plant and reducing the height of the plant to a more pleasing appearance. 

There are several types of lawn mowers available in the market. Some of the most common types are Push mowers, Self-propelled mowers, Riding mowers, Robotic mowers, Tractor mounted mowers, and Hover mowers. 

Golf course

A golf course is where the game of golf is usually played. It is made up of a series of 'holes', each consisting of certain key areas. A teeing ground is used to start playing the hole. A Fairway is the area between the tee and the green, where the grass is kept short for ball play. The green (or putting green) is a closely mowed area of grass surrounding the hole. It has a flagstick so the golfer can see the hole at longer distances. The hole itself has a diameter of 4¼ inches (108mm). Other areas of a golf course are called hazards. These include sand hazards and water hazards. Hazards are designed to make the game more challenging.

A standard round of golf consists of playing eighteen holes. Many golf courses are designed with eighteen holes. Some, however, only have nine holes, and the course is played twice per round.

Tom Eckersley

Tom Eckersley (30 September 1914, Lancashire – 4 August 1997) was an English poster artist and teacher of design.


Leaf blower

A leaf blower is a gardening tool uses air to move yard debris like leaves. Some leaf blowers can also suck leaves through a vacuum, and shred (break into small pieces) them into a bag.

Hose

A hose is a tube made to take fluids or gasses from one place to another. Hoses are also called tube or pipes. The shape of a hose is usually cylindrical.

Watering can

A watering can is a container that is used to water plants by hand.

Irrigation sprinkler

Sprinkler irrigation is a way of artificially watering plants. A sprinkler irrigation system is a pressurized system, which means it needs water under pressure to work. There are many different types of irrigation sprinklers. Some are used in home gardens, and some are used on farms.

A permanent sprinker system is made of a pump to take water and create pressure, and a network of pipes leading to the sprinkler heads. Usually the sprinkler head is on a small pipe that comes out of the ground.

Skagit River

The Skagit River is a river in Canada and the United States. It flows about from British Columbia to the state of Washington, where it flows into the Pacific Ocean north of Seattle. The river begins by flowing south. It then enters North Cascades National Park, where it is dammed by Ross Dam, which forms Ross Lake, a reservoir. 

The river then leaves the lake and flows into Diablo Lake, also a reservoir. It then keeps flowing southwest through a deep river canyon, known as the Skagit Gorge. It then meets its largest tributary, the Sauk River, and then turns west. The Sauk is about 45 miles long, flowing northwest.

After turing west, the Skagit parallels the North Cascades Highway, leaving the national park. It meets another tributary, the Baker River, from the north. The Baker flows south about 30 miles and is dammed twice, in Baker Lake and Lake Shannon. The river then flows out to the sea near Mount Vernon, Washington. The total extent of the basin is 1,505 square miles (3,900 square kilometers).

North Cascades National Park

North Cascades National Park is a national park in the U.S. state of Washington. It was established on 2 October 1968. The park covers 634,000 acres of the Cascade Range (specifically the North Cascades).
The Park is split in half by the Skagit River, which flows south then southwest through the park. Another primary watercourse of the park is the Baker River which flows into the Skagit and the Stehekin River (which flows into Lake Chelan in the southeast).

North Cascades National Park features the rugged mountain peaks of the North Cascades Range. This is the most expansive glacial system in the mainland United States. The Park also has the headwaters of numerous waterways, and vast forests with the highest degree of flora biodiversity of any US national park.
The region was first settled by Paleo-Indian Native Americans. By the time white explorers arrived it was inhabited by Skagit tribes.

Green River

The Green River is a river in the states of Wyoming and Utah, in the United States. It is the largest tributary of the Colorado River, at about 730 miles (1,175 km) long. Its headwaters are in the west part of Wyoming, in a subrange of the Rocky Mountains known as the Wind River Range. From there, it flows south, then turns east for a short while, then flows south, west, and south into the Reservoir, formed by Fontenelle Dam, and Flaming Gorge Reservoir, which is formed by the Flaming Gorge Dam. 

After it exits the dam, it flows east around the Uinta Mountains, and enters the desert-like Colorado Plateau. Here, it flows in a series of deep and spectacular canyons. It meets both of its largest tributaries, the White River and the Yampa River, from the east. In Canyonlands National Monument, it meets the Colorado. Shortly after the two rivers meet, they flow into Lake Powell, formed by Glen Canyon Dam.


Mono Lake

Mono Lake is a saline lake on the east side of the Sierra Nevada, in the U.S. state of California. It is endorheic, meaning that it does not connect with the sea. It is fed by streams flowing off the east side of the mountain range, including Rush Creek, Lee Vining Creek and Mill Creek. Lee Vining Creek has its headwaters near Tioga Pass, near Yosemite National Park. 

The lake covers 69 square miles (180 square kilometers) and is about long. It is a very ancient lake, and is thought to have formed 760,000 years ago. In the 20th century, the city of Los Angeles began to take water from the streams feeding Mono Lake. This caused the lake to fall, exposing unique tufa formations.

Thelyphonida

Thelyphonida is an order of arachnids commonly known as vinegarroons.

They give out a vinegar-like mist (containing mostly acetic acid). The Vinegarroon is not venomous and is not a true scorpion. It is related to spiders, true scorpions, and ticks. They are also known as whip scorpions because they look like true scorpions and because of their whip like tails.

Mount Shasta

Mount Shasta is a dormant volcano in northern California in the United States.

The volcano is part of the Cascade Range. It has a smaller peak abutting it, Shastina, and seven glaciers. The mountain stands alone in a large expanse of flatter land, rising 9,822 feet above the surrounding terrain. The Sacramento River flows south near the west edge of the mountain. The town of Mount Shasta and Shasta Lake Reservoir, formed by Shasta Dam, are all named for Mount Shasta. This stratovolcano is expected to erupt again someday.

Zhu Xi

Zhu Xi or Chu Hsi (, 18 October 1130 – 23 April 1200) was a Confucian scholar during the Song Dynasty. Zhu Xi was one of the three most important Confucian philosophers. He organized the classic works of Confucianism and contributed to the philosophy of Neo-Confucianism.He was from Fujian province in China. 

Zhu Xi was born Wu Yuan, North East Jiangxi province. His father died when he was at the age of thirteen. He continued his studies until he passed the test for a government job. He taught for many years in the Wuyi Mountains and he is also remembered for the time he spent teaching at the Yuelu Academy in Changsha and at his retreat near the White Deer Grotto in Lushan. In his life his ideas were not generally accepted and he was fired from quite a lot of official positions. After his death nearly 1000 people were at his funeral and his tablet was put in a Confucian temple.
During the Song Dynasty, Zhu Xi's teachings were considered to be unorthodox. Rather than focusing on the "Book of Changes" like other Neo-Confucians, he chose to emphasize the Four Books: the "Great Learning", the "Doctrine of the Mean", the "Analects of Confucius", and the "Mencius" as the core curriculum (thing to learn) for aspiring scholar officials. For all these classics he wrote extensive commentaries (big reviews) that were not widely recognized in his time; however, they later became accepted as their standard commentaries. The Four Books served as the basis of civil service examinations all the way down to 1905.

According to Zhu Xi, knowledge and action were indivisible components of truly intelligent activity. Although he did distinguish (tell apart) between the priority of knowing, since intelligent action requires forethought (thought before), and the importance of action, as it produces a discernible effect, Zhu Xi said "Knowledge and action always require each other. It is like a person who cannot walk without legs although he has eyes, and who cannot see without eyes although he has legs. With respect to order, knowledge comes first, and with respect to importance, action is more important."

Plym Valley Railway

The Plym Valley Railway is part of the closed South Devon and Tavistock Railway near Plymouth. It is a branch line of the Great Western Railway in Devon.

Swanage Railway

The Swanage Railway is a six-mile (10 km) long heritage railway in the Purbeck district of Dorset, England. The railway follows the route of the Purbeck branch line between Norden railway station, Corfe Castle railway station, Harman's Cross railway station, Herston Halt railway station and Swanage. The line was re−connected to the mainline at Wareham, Dorset along a stretch of the branch line. This had previously only remained open to freight traffic until 2005. Trains operate on the Swanage Railway between Swanage and Norden Park & Ride every weekend and Bank Holiday from mid-February to the end of the year. From April to October, they operate all seven days in the week; with Santa Special services in December. The link between the Swanage Railway and the main line at Wareham has been used used for materials deliveries, special excursions. The line has now reopened to its first through traffic from London with occasional special services.

Mangapps Railway Museum

The Mangapps Railway Museum (previously Mangapps Farm Railway Museum) is a heritage railway located near Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex. The stretch of standard gauge track and museum are owned and operated by the Jolly family. They are assisted by a dedicated staff of volunteers. It was never part of the national rail network. 

West Somerset Railway

The West Somerset Railway (WSR) is a heritage railway. It runs along the edge of the Quantock Hills in Somerset, England, between Bishops Lydeard and Watchet. The line then turns inland to Washford. It then returns to the coast for the run to Minehead. The Exmoor National Park is nearby.

Vale of Glamorgan Railway

The Vale of Glamorgan Railway Company are a Welsh railway preservation society originally called the Butetown Historic Railway Society.

In 1979, the Butetown Historic Railway Society was formed at Bute Road Station in the docklands are of Cardiff. The aim was to restore the then derelict Taff Vale Railway station, and establish a steam hauled passenger service to Cardiff Queen Street station. By 1994, a short section of track existed, and the steam locomotive "Sir Gomer" hauled short passenger trains.

By 1997, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was in charge of the redevelopment of Butetown, and dismissed the idea of a rejuvenated steam railway as part of their plans.

Even prior to 1997 the railway started negotiations with the Vale of Glamorgan Council and moved in during 1998 to its new base at Barry Island Railway. It renamed it self the Vale of Glamorgan Railway Company and were based there till early 2009 operating heritage services both steam and diesel over an expanding network of lines.

Following the December 2007 decision by landlords, the Vale of Glamorgan Council to terminate the £65,000 funding of the Barry Island Railway, the society maintain a service. However less than six months after withdrawing financial support, the council with out warning decided to put the railway site out to tender under a long term lease. There were three bids submitted with the sucsefull bidder being the commercial company Cambrian Transport who have been the councils railway adviser and contractor since the Barry Railway Project started.

The other bidder NEWCO was submitted by Graham Lee owner of the LH Plant, Hunselt Engine Company, Statfold Barn Railway and Mike Thomson owner of Arrowvale who make black boxes for the rail industry. NEWCO had spoken to the VGR in advance and agree a method of working together. Had this bid been successfully the VGR would have continued operating at Barry.

The Railway has recently sold assets following the break down of talks with Cambrian Transport which an has been forced to leave Barry. It is now the intention for the railway to relocate to the Bridgend Valleys Railway, with some stock also going to the Dean Forest Railway and further a field.

The Railway is now working with the Bridgend Valleys Railway to develop the 4.5 miles of line in place north of Bridgend.

Northampton &amp; Lamport Railway

The Northampton & Lamport Railway is a standard gauge heritage railway in Northamptonshire, England. It is based at Pitsford and Brampton station, near the villages of Pitsford and Chapel Brampton. This is roughly north of Northampton.

Epping Ongar Railway

The Epping Ongar Railway is a preserved railway. It runs along the last section of the old Great Eastern Railway and London Underground Central line branch line. The line runs between Epping and Ongar. There is also an intermediate stop at North Weald. The line was reopened in late 2004 after 10 years of being closed. It runs a Sunday and Bank Holiday service using a Class 117 diesel multiple unit. The service runs between Ongar and Coopersale. The service is provided by volunteers who take care for the line as well as run the trains. The land and infrastructure are owned by Epping Ongar Railway Ltd.

The branch line to Ongar was built in 1865 by the Eastern Counties/Great Eastern Railway. The eastern section of the line, between Epping and Ongar, was single track. There was one passing loop at North Weald station. Around 14 trains went as far as Ongar station each day. The rest finished at Epping or Loughton.

The trains continued to finish at Epping or Loughton until 1949. At this time the London Passenger Transport Board's New Works project extended the Central line to Epping using electric trains. The Central Line would take over the railway from British Rail. As part of this change, the Epping-Ongar branch line had its through trains to London removed. Instead, a shuttle service between Epping (to connect with trains to London) and Ongar was used. At one stage, it was possible to see the unusual sight of steam trains and London Underground electric multiple units side-by-side at Epping. The steam shuttle was hired by the London Transport Executive from British Rail. This was because it was felt that the cost of electrifying the line to Ongar could not be justified because of the low passenger numbers on this part of the branch.
In the 1950s, there were attempts to improve the service on the branch line. Over time, permission was given to electrify the line in 1957. However, because the electrification did not cost much, the branch was only able to have special two- or three-car trains running on it. This was because the power supply was not strong enough to support trains that had more cars. Another problem was that the stations on the line had short platforms. This would mean that the normal 8-car trains would not be able to stop at them. Because of this, the Epping-Ongar branch line was normally operated separately from the rest of the Central Line. However, for two days each year, trains did run through from London. These trains would terminate at North Weald for the airshow on the Saturday and Sunday of its opening. The normal Epping-Ongar service would get around this extra service by passing the train on the other line at North Weald station whilst it headed towards Epping. The train from London was run as an extra train on the normal Central Line timetable. However, this extra train was only four carriages long instead of the normal eight.

During the late 1960s it became clear that the number of people using the line had not become as high as people thought that it would. Not a lot of new development was allowed because the land was now Green Belt land. The number of people using the line peaked in 1971, and it was still only 650 people every day. This meant that the line did not make very much money. London Underground tried to close the whole line in 1980, but they were not able to. Instead, fewer trains were run on the line and they also closed Blake Hall tube station on Sundays.

Blake Hall was permanently closed in 1981. Before the station closed it only had six passengers a day. The station building still survives as a private residence. However, the platform was removed, but recently (2015) partially reinstated to a very high standard.

North Weald station's platform one was closed in 1976. The passing loop and westbound tracks were lifted in 1978. Until this time, access to the two platforms was controlled from the original Eastern Counties Railway signal box. This signal box is still on the southbound platform. North Weald was the last section of the London Underground network to be signalled using semaphore signals.

The line was making a loss of seven pounds for each passenger journey. It was also in need of some expensive maintenance work. On 30 September 1994, the line was closed to the public, with one months notice. From this time on, the Central Line terminated at Epping station. When the line closed it was carrying just 80 passengers a day. Local lore said that the line was being kept open in case the Cabinet needed to be evacuated to the nuclear bunker at Kelvedon Hatch.

Cravens Heritage Trains have preserved a three-car unit of 1960 stock. This was the train that ran the final London Underground service on the line.

The line was bought by Pilot Developments in 1998. Pilot Developments is now known as Epping Ongar Railway Ltd. The Ongar Railway Preservation Society also entered an offer to buy the line. Their offer was for £339,500. However, Pilot Developments matched the offer and got London Underground to accept it. Martin Bell, an independent politician, said that this was "the most controversial land deal in the constituency for years". He said that there was a conflict of interest with local politicians.

The line reopened on Sunday 10 October 2004. It is being run by the Epping Ongar Railway Volunteer Society. An hourly service between Ongar and North Weald was operated. Shortly after opening the line was extended to Coopersale. However, it is currently not possible to get off the train there.

Between 22 January and 9 April 2006 the line was closed for engineering works. The works included general station maintenance, rolling stock maintenance and track maintenance. Ongar station remained closed for engineering works and general maintenance and reopened on Sunday 28 May 2006 to passengers. At first though it was not possible to use the station buildings.

At the end of 2007, the railway was sold to a new private owner. This was because planning permission for the Ongar residential development had been given. The new owner wants to bring steam locomotives back to the line.

In early 2008, the line was closed to passenger trains. This was to allow the railway to be able to have major engineering works. The work will mean that steam locomotives will be able to run on the line again. To make this happen run-round loops and signalling, amongst other things, must be built.

Passenger services on the heritage line were operated throughout 2006 and 2007 by a Class 117 diesel multiple unit. This unit is currently being restored along with a class 205 DEMU. Class 37029 is in operation along with 03170. There are a selection of British rail Mk1 and Mk2 coaches on the line. The line also has some small diesel shunters; a Drewry shunter (works number 2566, current number D1995), named "Heather" by the railway, and two Ruston 88 shunters (RH 512572 is in service, RH 398616 is being used for spares and as a static display). The line employs a Harsco tug unit ("Badger") for engineering work. The EOR's fleet also includes a small works trolley, a Shark brake van, a Dogfish ballast hopper, and a box van for permanent way duties. 

At one point the line owned two trains of 1962 tube stock. Units 1616 and 1491 (formed as an eight-car train) were purchased in 1996, and unit 1744 was purchased in 1998. These units were taken away to be cut up for scrap in 1998 and 2003, respectively, after they were destroyed by vandals.


Ecclesbourne Valley Railway

The Ecclesbourne Valley Railway is a heritage railway in Derbyshire. Its operations are based at Wirksworth station. It is currently planned to extend the railway along the former Midland Railway branch line which joined the main-line at Duffield. 

When complete it will be one of the few Heritage Railways that operates a whole branch line in its original form and entire length.

The line is operated by diesel locomotives, which haul former multiple unit trailer cars and also uses heritage diesel multiple units.

The "Wirksworth Branch" was the product of early nineteenth century railway rivalry. Since 1835 Wirksworth's citizens had been promoting the idea for a branch line from the North Midland Railway (later the Midland Railway) at Duffield. The Midland was initially uninterested, but then realised that the branch could be extended to Rowsley. This was difficult, but the branch could avoid the section from Ambergate, on its Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway, which was shared with its rival the London and North Western Railway.

Crossrail 2

The Chelsea-Hackney (or "Chelney") line is a safeguarded route for an underground railway running from south-west London to north-east London. As of 2008, the plan is being developed by Cross London Rail Links Ltd. who are the developers of Crossrail. It is therefore sometimes known as Crossrail 2.

River Lee

The River Lee or River Lea is a river in England. It begins in Leagrave Park, Leagrave, Luton in the Chiltern Hills. It flows generally southeast, east, and then south to London where it meets the River Thames. The last section is known as Bow Creek.
A section of the river runs through Hertford castle and shares a valley with the river Beane at Hartham common. Morgans School, in Hertford, have named one of their houses after the river Lea.

Naval mine

A naval mine is a bomb placed in water to destroy ships or submarines. Unlike depth charges, mines are put in the water and left to wait until they make contact with a ship. Naval mines can be used offensively, to make it harder for enemy ships to sail easily, or trap them into a harbour. They can also be used defensively, to protect friendly ships and create "safe" zones.

Mines can be laid in many ways: by specially built minelayers, refitted ships, submarines, aircraft, or even by dropping them into a harbour by hand. They are a cheap weapon with a basic mine costing as little as US$1000. There are very advanced mines which can cost millions and have several kinds of sensors, and deliver a warhead by rocket or torpedo.

International law says that nations have to say when they put mines in an area. This is to make it easier for civil shipping to avoid the mines. The warnings do not have to be specific; during World War II, Britain said simply that it had mined the English Channel, North Sea, and French coast.

Alan Fletcher (graphic designer)

Alan Gerard Fletcher (27 September 1931 – 21 September 2006) was a British graphic designer. He was described by "The Daily Telegraph" as "the most highly regarded graphic designer of his generation, and probably one of the most prolific".

The Edge Chronicles

The Edge Chronicles are books of young-adult and fantasy written by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell. It contains three trilogies. All in the books is surrealist. Characters, cities, places, monuments, animals, plants, transportation and more were invented by the writers.

Francisco Correa de Arauxo

Francisco Correa de Arauxo (or Araujo) (b. Seville, 1584; d. Segovia, 1654) was an important Spanish organist, composer, and theorist in the last years of the Renaissance and early years of the Baroque period.

We do not know very much about Correa de Araujo. He was probably born in 1584. He may have been of Portugese origin. In 1599 he got a job as organist in Seville. It must have been an important job because he earned a lot of money. Many years later he seems to have become a priest. He may have been made a priest because he was a good organist. In 1630 he organized a protest when priests were made to work harder wothout being paid more money. Because he argued about this he was sent to prison for a time. By 1635 his health was very bad. In spite of earning a high salary he often had no money.

After 37 years in Seville he took a job as organist in Jaén Cathedral. He was there until 1640 when he went to Segovia Cathedral. He worked there until 1653, by which time he was too ill to work. When he died the following year he was very poor.

Correa only seems to have published one collection of organ works. It was called "Libro de tientos y discursos de música practica, y theorica de organo intitulado Facultad organica" (1626). This was a collection of organ music, as well as a discussion about music theory. It is one of the few books we have which shows us what musical composition was like in Spain at that time. His organ music uses a divided keyboard (medio registro), so that the upper and lower parts of the keyboard (high notes and low notes) can use different stops (making different sounds). The organ pieces in the collection are arranged in order of difficulty. The pieces at the end are very hard indeed. He uses a lot of dissonances, and he expects the performer to put in lots of ornaments, even if they are not shown in the music. He uses glosa (ornamental figuration), although he also uses counterpoint. His harmony shows the influence of composers such as Cabezon and Aguilera de Heredia.


Collaboration

Collaboration is when people work with each other to complete a task. It involves co-operation and teamwork and the sharing of ideas, knowledge and skills to reach the same objective. The objective is usually creative in nature. Most collaboration needs leadership or some kind of co-ordination, although responsibilities can be shared within an egalitarian group.

Each person plays a tightly or loosely defined role in the process of collaboration. For instance, to make a movie a writer, director, producer and actors are needed. There may also be a need for a costumer, a cameraman (if the director cannot do it all), an audio engineer, and a film editor if the project is big enough and the schedule tight enough.

Not only individuals collaborate; groups also do it. Large construction projects are usually done by collaborations between corporations, wars are often fought between alliances of countries, and political parties often collaborate in government.


Apollo 14

Apollo 14 was the eighth crewed mission in the Apollo program. It was the third mission to land on the Moon. The nine-day mission left the Earth on January 31, 1971, and landed on the Moon on February 5. The Lunar Module landed in the Fra Mauro formation; this had been the target of the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission. During the two walks on the Moon's surface, of moon rock was collected. Several experiments, including seismic studies, were carried out. Commander Alan Shepard famously hit two golf balls on the lunar surface with a makeshift club he had brought from Earth. Command Module Pilot Stuart Roosa took several hundred seeds on the mission, many of which were planted on return, resulting in the so-called Moon trees. The pilot of the Lunar Module was Dr. Edgar Mitchell.

In June 2009, the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was able to photograph the Apollo 14 landing site. The base of the lunar module and the astronauts footprints on the Moon's suface could be clearly seen.

Plantain

The plantain is a crop from the genus Musa. Its fruits are edible, and are generally used for cooking. This is different from the soft and sweet banana (which is often called "dessert banana"). "Dessert bananas" are more common to import in countries in the European Union or the United States.

The way certain species are called often show how they are used: "cooking plantain", "banana plantain", "beer banana", "bocadillo plantain" (the little one), etc. All members of the genus "Musa" are indigenous to the tropical region of Southeast Asia, including the Malay Archipelago and northern Australia.

Plantains are often firmer than dessert bananas; they also have less sugar. Dessert bananas are often eaten raw; plantains are usually cooked or otherwise processed before they are eaten. Plantains are a staple food in tropical regions, treated similarly to potatoes.

Primary cultivation originated in Southeast Asia, secondary in West Africa. Other regions with plantain crops include the Southern United States, the Caribbean, Central America, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, the Canary Islands, Madeira, Egypt, Cameroon, Nigeria, Uganda, Okinawa, Kerala and Taiwan. Farmers grow plantains as far north as Northern California and as far south as KwaZulu-Natal.

Each pseudostem of a plantain plant will flower only once. All the flowers grow at the end of its shoot in a large bunch made of multiple "hands" with individual "fingers" (the fruits). Only the first few hands will become fruits. In Vietnam the young male flower, at the end of the bunch, is used to make salad. 
In Laos, the plantain flower is often eaten raw; it is added to a special kind of soup. Thoran is made in Kerala with the end of the bunch (called "Koompu" in Malayalam and Vazhaipoo in Tamil). It is said to be very healthy. You can fry it or boil it

Plantain leaves are used like plates in several dishes, including hallaca from Venezuela, or south Indian Thali. In southern India, meals are traditionally served on a plantain leaf. The position of the different food items on the leaf is important, also for Hindu rituals.

The plantain leaves often add an aroma to the dish. In the Indian state of Kerala, a food preparation called "Ada" is made in plantain leaves. Plantain leaves are also used in making "Karimeen Pollichathu" in Kerala.

The leaves are usually easy to find in Venezuela. They are sold at grocery stores, and they can be bought on the open-air markets there . Leaves can be very big, over in length. They are also used to stimulate appetite, as they have a distinctive smell when hot food is placed on them.

In Nicaragua, leaves are used to wrap different kinds of food, such as Nacatamales,Vigoron and Vaho. In Peru they are often used to wrap the famous Tamale (Tamales). In Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia, these are usually used to wrap tamales before and while cooking, and they can be used to wrap any kind of seasoned meat while cooking to keep the flavor in. The plantain is the main food source of the Dominican Republic, and is used just as much as, if not more than, rice. Mangu and Sancocho are two dishes for which the plantain is very important.

The leaves are also dried and used to wrap corn dough before it is boiled to make Fanti kenkey, a fine Ghanaian dish eaten with ground pepper, onions, tomatoes and fish.

The plantain will only fruit once. After harvesting the fruit, the plantain plant can be cut and the layers peeled (like an onion) to get a cylinder shaped soft shoot. This can be chopped and first steamed, then fried with masala powder, to make an excellent dish. This dish is called "Posola" in Assamese and a distinct part of Assamese cuisine. 

Staple food

A staple food is a food item that can be stored easily and eaten throughout the year. 

The term means the common basis of the everyday diet in a place. Potatoes and rice are the most usual examples, but bread is "not" a staple food because it is a manufactured food which cannot be stored. Of course, it can always be made, since wheat "is" a staple food. Fruit is not a staple because it usually grows at a certain time of year. Meat is not a staple because it may not be available, or is expensive to buy. Green vegetables may be a staple in some countries, but not others. Foods which need special facilities, such as refrigeration are not staple foods.

Here are some examples of staple foods:

Zhengzhou

Zhengzhou (, pinyin: zhèngzhōu) is the capital of Henan Province in the People's Republic of China. It is in the northcentral part of Henan.

Zhengzhou is on the southern bank of the Yellow River. It is one of the Eight Great Ancient Capitals of China. In 2010, 9,378,000 people lived there.

As of 2017, the prefecture-level city is divided into 6 urban districts, 5 county-level cities and 1 county. Because of rapid population growth, the subdivisions may change.

Braidwood, New South Wales

Braidwood () is a town in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. It is in the Palerang Shire. In 2006 there were 1,108 people living in Braidwood. It was used as a location for the movie Ned Kelly starring Mick Jagger in 1969.

Braidwood is on the Kings Highway which joins Canberra to Batemans Bay on the coast. It is about south west of Sydney. It is in a highland area near the headwaters of the Shoalhaven River.

Europen explorers, Kearns, Marsh and Packer, reached the area in 1822 and the settlers arrived soon after. The town was surveyed in 1839. Gold was discovered in 1851, and over the next 20 years the population grew to about 10,000.

The town was named after Dr Thomas Braidwood Wilson. He had been a surgeon on the ships taking convicts to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (now known as Tasmania). He was first given land in Van Diemen's Land in 1824, but changed it for land near Lake George in 1825. He was also given of land in the 'new country' on Monkittee and Flood creeks. In 1833 the government took back the western end of Wilson's land for a future village. They gave him more land at the eastern land in return. Wilson moved to the district in late 1836 with his wife and family. He became a community leader. He built the first courthouse in 1837-38. In 1840 Wilson asked the government to build a road from Braidwood to Huskisson for faster and cheaper shipping of wool to Sydney. Wilson and Col. John Mackenzie, supplied the materials and men to make the Braidwood to Nerriga section. In 1841 there were 141 people living at Braidwood Farm. Wilson lost all of his money because of a drought in the late 1830s. He died in November 1843. His land was sold for £2,000 to John Coghill, who now owned most of the land on the south, east and north of the town. Wilson still owned land on a hill north of the town and was buried there in 1843.

A memorial and large pine tree mark the site of Wilson's grave. The path to the grave is open to the public and is through a series of paddocks with gateway sculptures and large art pieces by local artists.

Bushrangers, Thomas and John Clarke, killed four policemen near Braidwood in 1867. There is a special monument for the police in the Braidwood cemetery.

Australia's first Royal Commission took place in Braidwood in 1867. It looked at the role of the police in trying to control bushrangers in the area. The Commission found the police were lazy, and in some cases had actually helped the bushrangers. They found that the superintendent of police did not have 'strict and proper control over his men.'

Because of the goldrush the banks and hotels in Braidwood were well built and made to last. It is these old heritage buildings that now attract visitors to the town. Other businesses in the area are sheep and cattle farming, and timber growing.

Braidwood used to be the home of the Tallaganda local government area. However, following changes to local government areas by the New South Wales Government, it is now part of the Palerang council. The eastern office of the council is in the town. The local paper is now called the "Braidwood Times".

After the gold rush, Braidwood became a quiet and poor country town. Because of this, very little new building work was carried out, and so the town still has most of its original streetscape and architecture intact. On 30 March 2006 the town and its setting were listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. There were arguments between those who wanted to save the town's old fashioned charm and those wishing to develop it.

The town has several times been used for movie making locations:

Local stories say that Mick Jagger wrote one of his major hits while in Braidwood making the "Ned Kelly" film; but there is no agreement as to which one.



Hunan

Hunan (; ) is a province of South Central China, in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and south of Lake Dongting (The characters in the name "Hunan" mean "lake" and "south"). Hunan is sometimes called 湘 () for short, after the Xiang River which runs through the province.

Its major cities are Changde, Changsha, Chenzhou, Hengyang, Huaihua, Loudi, Shaoyang, Xiangtan, Yiyang, Yongzhou, Yueyang, Zhangjiajie and Zhuzhou.

Guangxi

Guangxi is a provincial-level autonomous region of the People's Republic of China where mostly Zhuang people live.

Guangxi's capital in Nanning. Other major cities are Baise, Beihai, Chongzuo, Fangchenggang, Guigang, Guilin, Hechi, Hezhou, Laibin, Liuzhou, Qinzhou, Wuzhou and Yulin.

It is near Vietnam and has many mountains. It is one of the border frontiers of Chinese civilization. Even in the 20th century it was considered an open, wild territory. The current name "Guang" itself means "expanse", and has been associated with the region since the creation of Guang Prefecture in 226 AD. It was given provincial level status during the Yuan Dynasty and in 1949 was reformed as one of China's five autonomous regions.

Season structure of the NHL

The National Hockey League (NHL) season is divided into the regular season and the Stanley Cup playoffs. In the regular season, teams play 82 games which determine their standings. The eight top teams in each conference enter the playoff elimination tournament to determine the Stanley Cup champion.


2009 Formula One World Championship

The 2009 Formula One season was the 60th FIA Formula One World Championship season. There were ten teams signed up to compete in the championship. Jenson Button became the Drivers' World Champion and Brawn GP won the Constructors' title.

The season is scheduled to take place over 17 rounds, and started with the Australian Grand Prix on 29 March 2009. It will end on 1 November 2009 with the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which is included on the race calendar for the first time and will be held at the new Yas Marina Circuit. The French and Canadian Grands Prix, which were both included in the 2008 championship, have been dropped.

Several rule changes will be implemented by the FIA, in a bid to cut costs due to the global financial crisis and to improve the on-track spectacle. New rules governing tyres, aerodynamics and Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS), among others, are some of the biggest changes in the Formula One regulations for several decades. FIA initially declared a change in deciding the World Driver's Championship, with the driver winning the most races to be declared as the champion. However, this decision was later reversed following protests from Formula One Teams Association.

 Drivers did not finish the Grand Prix, but were classified as they completed over 90% of the race distance.


Bucegi Mountains

The Bucegi Mountains () are in central Romania to the south of the city Braşov. They are part of the Southern Carpathians group of the Carpathian Mountains of Europe.

To the east, the Bucegi Mountains have a very steep slope. This is towards the popular tourist destination Prahova Valley. At a higher elevation is the Bucegi Plateau, where wind and rain have turned the rocks into brilliant figures such as the Sphinx and "Babele".

The Bucegi is thought to be the Dacian holy mountain "Kogainon". Here, the mythical figure Zalmoxis resided in a cave.

Private First Class

In many armed forces in the world, Private First Class (PFC) is a rank held by junior enlisted persons.


Lance Corporal

Lance corporal is a military rank, used by many armed forces around the world, and also by some police forces and other uniformed organizations. It is below the rank of Corporal, and is typically the lowest Non-commissioned officer, usually equivalent to the NATO Rank Grade OR-3.


Ned Kelly (1970 movie)

Ned Kelly is the name of a 1970 movie. It was the second Australian feature length movie about Australian bushranger Ned Kelly. The first was "The Story of the Kelly Gang" made in 1906, the world's first feature movie.

"Ned Kelly" was directed by Tony Richardson, and starred Mick Jagger as Ned Kelly. Scottish-born actor Mark McManus played the part of Kelly's friend Joe Byrne. It was a British production, but was filmed entirely in Australia, shot mostly around Braidwood in southern New South Wales, with mainly Australian actors.

There were many problems in getting the movie made. The actors' union, Actors' Equity and some of Ned Kelly's relatives protested strongly about Jagger having the lead role. Many people were upset that the movie would be made in New South Wales, not Victoria, where the Kellys had lived.

Jagger's girlfriend, Marianne Faithfull, had come to Australia to play the lead female role of Ned's sister, Maggie. Their relationship was breaking up, and she took an overdose of sleeping tablets soon after she got to Sydney. She was in a coma, but soon got better and went back to England. She was replaced by an unknown Australian actress, Diane Craig. During filming, Jagger was hurt by a pistol misfiring. The actors and crew were often sick, some costumes were destroyed by fire, and Jagger's co-star, Mark McManus, just escaped serious injury when a horse-drawn cart in which he was riding overturned during filming.

The body armour costume worn by Jagger is on show at the Queanbeyan City Library, with the letters "MJ" scratched on the inside. The head-piece has been stolen, the loss of an important piece of Australian movie history.

The movie was very poorly received at its opening, and is still said to be Richardson's worst movie. Neither Richardson or Jagger went to the London opening of the movie.

The movie has music written by Shel Silverstein, and performed by Kris Kristofferson and Waylon Jennings, with one song by Jagger.


Spring Offensive

The 1918 Spring Offensive or Kaiserschlacht ("Kaiser's Battle"), also known as the Ludendorff Offensive, was a series of German attacks along the Western Front during World War I, which marked the deepest advances by either side since 1914. The German authorities had realised that their only remaining chance of victory was to defeat the Allies before the overwhelming human and matériel resources of the United States could be deployed. They also had the advantage of nearly 50 divisions freed by the Russian surrender (Treaty of Brest-Litovsk). 

The first and most important part was called Operation Michael. It used new infiltration tactics. After the offensive, not enough German soldiers were still alive to win the war anymore.

Tang Enbo

Tang Enbo (1898-1959) was a Nationalist general in the Republic of China. Along with Hu Zongnan and Xue Yue, Tang was one of the Kuomintang generals most respected by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. 


Xue Yue

Xue Yue (1896-1998) was a Nationalist general in the Republic of China. Xue joined the Chinese army in 1914, at the age of 18. Along with Hu Zongnan and Tang Enbo, Xue was one of the Kuomintang generals most respected by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Xue was in the defense of greater Wuhan, commanding the 1st Army Corps. In the mountains Xue's army succeeded in nearly destroying the 106th division of the Japanese army. During the battle, most of the Japanese officers were killed and the Japanese had to drop 300 officers by parachute into the battlefield. 

Xue lived to 101 years old.

Shunroku Hata

, was a Japanese general. 

Hata was minister of war in 1939. He was commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) in China in 1941. 

He was the last surviving Japanese military officer with a rank of Field Marshal. He was jailed at the end of World War Two and released in 1955.


Bai Chongxi

Bai Chongxi (18 March 1893 – 1 December 1966), also spelled Pai Chung-hsi, was a Chinese Muslim general in the National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China. He was a warlord in the Guangxi Province, commanding his own troops and governing Guangxi (though part of the Republic of China). He was often an ally of Chiang Kai-Shek in the politics of the Republic of China. 

Bai Chongxi Born Omar Chongxi Bai was born in Guilin, Guangxi Province.

Letter of Jeremiah

The Letter of Jeremiah, also known as the Epistle of Jeremy is a deuterocanonical (or apocryphal) book of the Old Testament. The letter is believed to have been made by Jeremiah to the people who were to be taken prisoner into Babylon. It is included in Catholic Bibles as the last part of the Book of Baruch. It is also in Orthodox Bibles as a standalone book.

Most learned people argue that the person who started the book was not Jeremiah. Jeremiah was a Hellenistic Jew who lived in Alexandria. Whoever wrote it, the work was written with a purpose: to teach the Jews not to worship the gods of the Babylonians. Instead, to worship only the Lord.
The letter (epistle) is part of the Septuagint. 

The earliest evidence we have of the question of its canonicity arising in Christian tradition is in the work of Origen of Alexandria, as reported by Eusebius in his Church History. Origen listed Lamentations and the Letter of Jeremiah as one unit with the Book of Jeremiah proper, among "the canonical books as the Hebrews have handed them down". 

Jerome provided the majority of the translation work for the vulgar (popular) Latin translation of the Bible, called the Vulgate Bible. In view of the fact that no Hebrew text was available, Jerome refused to consider the Epistle of Jeremiah, like the other books he called apocryphal, canonical.

Despite Jerome's reservations, it is included as chapter 6 of the book of Baruch in the Old Testament of the Vulgate. The Authorized King James Version does the same, while placing Baruch in the Apocrypha section. In the Ethiopian Orthodox canon, it forms part of the "Rest of Jeremiah", along with 4 Baruch (also known as the "Paraleipomena of Jeremiah").

The epistle is one of three deuterocanonical books found among the Dead Sea scrolls (the other two are Ben Sira and Tobit.) The portion of the epistle discovered at Qumran was written in Greek. This does not mean that it might not be based on an earlier Hebrew or Aramaic text. The only text we have has dozens of linguistic features available in Greek, but not in Hebrew.

Revelation

A Revelation is a source of information that is given to some people and meant to share with others from a government, influential people or a supernatural deity. In monotheistic literature, a revelation is given by God to a prophet or someone God wants to make a prophet and it is supposed to be told to others. In this page, I will explain John’s Revelation from God that is also the last book in the Bible also coincdidently called Revelation.

In Catholicism and other Christian denominations, John is also called Saint John and was Jesus Christ’s 3rd/4th called disciple. John wrote a Gospel called The Gospel according to John. He also wrote 1st, 2nd and 3rd John. The most famous verse in the Bible was written by him in John 3:16 during Christ’s conversation with the pharisee Nicodemus. John wrote the Book of Revelation and I will explain it now.

In the beginning of Revelation, it is important to know that John was currently in exile in the island of Patmos, an island in the Aegean Sea and part of Greece’s territory now, because he refused to look at Emperor Domitian as Lord and God. John explains this and he also says he saw the Heavens, so we can suggest that he was writing what he saw while having his revelation or vision —whichever you choose to call it. 

I’m not going to explain every little detail, just an overview. Jesus tells him to send a message to 7 churches in Asia Minor, that is Turkey. These are Ephesus, Symrna, Pergammum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea. He explains He knows the suffering and He is watching over them.

A few chapters in and we see Apocalyptic literature. This was very common in the writing of Jews and Christians during the great persecution of Early Christians in the Roman Empire before Emperor Constantine made Christianity the state religion. You see a lot of beasts and creatures and then the greatly feared Antichrist.

I think now I should explain the 2 witnesses and the Antichrist. The 2 witnesses will be 2 prophets who God will raise from the dead and they will preach for three and a half years when the Antichrist will come and kill them both. Then because they have been slaughtered people from all around the world will drink and exchange gifts out of merriness and joyfulness because those 2 witnesses have died and nobody can shine the light of their sins. For three and a half days, they will not be allowed to be given their final dignity and put into graves. Then after 3 and a half days, God will raise them up from the dead and everyone will be shocked (imaginable) also will be ascending into Heaven.

The Antichrist is prominent in Revelation and is spoken a lot about. Christian and Jewish elders believe it will be an influential government that will trick everyone. But for everyone else its probably this tall, well-built "man" who will slaughter the Jews just when he has gained their trust.

That’s all I have now and I will come back soon with Revelation PART 2 soon. Have a great day! and I hoped you enjoyed reading this

Sebastián Aguilera de Heredia

Sebastian Aguilera de Heredia (1561-1627) was a Spanish organist and composer.

Aguilera was born in Zaragoza, Spain on about August 15, 1561.

We do not know much about his early life. He was ordained as a priest in January 1584. In 1585 he became organist at Huesca Cathedral, where he supervised the building of a new organ at the cathedral during 1588. In 1603 he became a priest and organist at the Cathedral of La Seo, Zaragossa. He looked after the organ at the cathedral and often had work done to improve it. He remained at the cathedral until his death on December 16, 1627.

All his compositions were for the church: both his organ music and vocal music. His organ works show that he learned from composers such as Antonio de Cabezón, but he put new, modern ideas in his music which later influenced younger composers such as Correa de Arauxo. His students became the cathedral organists after his death, and were part of a tradition and style of paying which lasted for over 100 years.

A very important new technique which he used was the use of a divided keyboard (medio registro) which allowed different sounds in the upper half and the lower half of the keyboard (on today's organs one would need a two-manual organ to get the same effect). He wrote 36 settings of the Magnificat, called "Canticum Beatissimae Virginis Deiparae Mariae" (1618). His vocal work shows a skilful use of polyphony.


Shahnameh

The Shahnameh or Shāhnāma ("Book of Kings", ) is a large poetic opus by the Persian poet Ferdowsi. The book was written between 977 to 1010 AD. The "Shahnameh" is about the mythical and historical past of Persia/Iran. It is the national epic of Persia/Iran and one of the greatest literary works of the Persian language.

"Shahnameh" has been composed of 3 main parts: 1. mythical, 2. heroic, 3. historical.

Papal conclave

A Papal conclave is a meeting of cardinals. The cardinals meet to elect the next bishop of Rome, to become pope. This becomes necessary when the old pope dies or resigns. Usually, popes do not resign, though. 

The last conclave was when Pope Benedict XVI resigned in 2013 and Pope Francis was elected to replace him.

The word "conclave" is from Latin. It refers to the fact that the cardinals are locked up together, until they have agreed on a new pope. Today, this happens in the Sistine Chapel. 

Originally, the conclave was started in Italian city states, in the 12th century. These cities needed to elect officeholders, and the election needed to be free of party politics. Events such as the Investiture Controversy in medieval Europe led to people wanting "free" elections, with a medieval understanding of free. Methods were often combined, the elements used were Acclamation, naming of candidates by predecessors, or by uninvolved people, and using "electors" who would agree on the successor, behind closed doors. Earliest examples are that of Genua, in 1157, Pisa, in 1162-64, or Pistoia. 

Pope Nicholas II published a papal bull called In Nomine Domini, in 1059, which introduced the conclave as the way to elect his successor. 

Seminary

A seminary, theological college or divinity school is a university that specializes in theology or philosophy. Very often the students live at the seminary. Usually, priests have to study at a seminary at the start of their career.

Hunger

Hunger is the feeling of wanting to eat. Ghrelin is a hormone that makes people feel hungry. The opposite of hunger is called "satiety" or "fullness". Leptin causes this feeling. People can survive weeks without eating, but they will start to feel hungry after they have not eaten for a few hours. Hunger is generally considered quite uncomfortable. People who have eaten food usually will feel less hungry, or not hungry at all. People can live longer without food than without water.

Hunger is also used to refer to people who generally have little to eat, and are therefore often hungry. This can lead to starvation.


Chanakya

Chanakya (IAST: ""; c. 350-283 BCE) was an adviser and a prime minister to Chandragupta Maurya (c. 340-293 BCE). He was born in Taxila, Gandhara in modern-day Pakistan. Chanakya helped Chandragupta create the Maurya Empire.

Shloka 1- नात्यन्तं सरलैर्भाव्यं गत्वा पश्य वनस्थलीम् ।छिद्यन्ते सरलास्तत्र कुब्जास्तिष्ठन्ति पादपाः ॥

English- Do not be very upright in your dealings, as you would see in forest, the straight trees are cut down while the crooked ones are left standing.

Shloka 2- कः कालः कानि मित्राणि को देशः कौ व्ययागमौ ।कश्चाहं का च मे शक्तिरिति चिन्त्यं मुहुर्मुहुः ॥
English- Consider again and again the following: the right time, the right friends, the right place, the right means of income, the right ways of spending, and from whom you derive your power.

Shloka 3- यो ध्रुवाणि परित्यज्य अध्रुवं परिषेवते ।ध्रुवाणि तस्य नश्यन्ति चाध्रुवं नष्टमेव हि ॥ ०१-१३
English- He who gives up what is imperishable for that which is perishable, loses that which is imperishable; and doubtlessly loses that which is perishable also.

Shloka 4- गुणैरुत्तमतां याति नोच्चैरासनसंस्थितः। प्रासादशिखरस्थोऽपि काकः किं गरुडायते॥ १६-०६

English- Greatness comes from good qualities and not from a high position. A crow doesn’t become a Garuda (the chief of the feathered race) just by sitting on the top of a palace.

Shloka 5- अतिरुपेनावे सिता: अतिगर्वेना उर्वशि अतिदानथा कर्ण पुरुश-श्रेष्ठ निष्पाप सरसवति नारद याति बखान| स्वर्गारोहन परिषेवते सम्राट| अत:पुरुषोत्तम रघुराम, अनाघ याति अयोध्या मे रामराज्य|

English- There can be no beautiful and compassionate woman like Sita. There can be no beautiful but proudy woman like Urvashi. There can be no man like Karna, the supremest of all men(पुरुश-श्रेष्ठ).

His glories and heroism has been narrated by Narada and Saraswati and eventually he attains the highest goal of a human and unites with his brothers in heaven and becomes the king of the Swarga. There can be no great men like Rama, the purushottam himself. He is sinless and eventually he also becomes the king of Ayodhya and brings Ram-Rajya on earth.

Shloka 6- नोच्चैरासनसंस्थितः ज्ञान अत:अहंकार बाली, अत: ज्ञान कृष्ण काकः लंकेश, समाज करे बखान|

English- Knowledge is the most powerful tool in this world. Gyaanis are always respected in this world no matter what. Despite their clans were destroyed, Bali, Krishna and Ravana still have their names in this world because of their 'Gyaan'.

He is generally called Chanakya (taken from his father's name "Chanak") but, in his capacity as author of the "Arthaśhāstra", is generally referred to as Kautilya derived from his gotra's name "KOTIL"(Kautilya means "of Kotil"). He believed in four ways: Treating with Equality, Enticement, Punishment or War and Sowing disagreement. The "Arthaśhāstra" identifies its author by the name Kautilya, except for one verse which refers to him by the name Vishnugupta. One of the earliest Sanskrit literatures to explicitly identify Chanakya with Vishnugupta was Vishnu Sarma's "Panchatantra" in the 3rd century BC.



Trowel

A trowel is a small tool used for digging, smoothing, or moving around small amounts of material.


Juniper

Junipers is the name for a number of species of coniferous plants in the genus "Juniperus". They are related to the family "Cupressaceae" (the cypress). There are between 50 and 67 species of juniper. Junipers grow in the northern hemisphere. 

Junipers are evergreen. They vary in size from low shrubs to tall trees, which grow to between twenty and forty metres tall. 

The female trees have seed cones. These look like like a berry, and are called juniper berries. They take from six to eighteen months to grow after pollination. They are often aromatic, and can be used as a spice.

Unfortunately, the berries of some species, such as "Juniperus sabina", are toxic. Eating them them is not advised. "Juniper" has a number of species, and you have to know what you are doing before you eat the berries.

Juniper berry

The juniper berry is the female seed cone made by the different kinds of junipers. It is not a true berry, but its unusual roundness and merged scales make it look like a berry. Some of the cones are used as spices. Juniper berries are also used to flavour gin. According to a FAO document, juniper berries are the only spice that comes from conifers. However, tar and bark from pine trees are sometimes thought of as spices, too.
These strange and useful berries have a sour but stainable taste that isn’t suggested but if you desire you may eat one. They have also been called the clean bum fruit through history dating back to 17,000 b.c.

Henry Kissinger

Henry Alfred Wolfgang Kissinger (born Heinz Alfred Wolfgang Kissinger; May 27, 1923 – November 29, 2023), , was a German-American political scientist, diplomat, and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. He served as both National Security Advisor and later as Secretary of State in the Nixon Administration and the Ford Administration.

Kissinger was born in Germany in 1923. As a German Jew, it was not safe for him to stay in Germany after Adolf Hitler came to power, and he left for the United States in 1933. He fought for the US against the Nazis in World War II.

Kissinger was Richard Nixon's most trusted advisor on foreign affairs. He was in government during the Cold War and promoted what he called "realpolitik" in dealing with the Soviet Union and Communist China. He was a major force behind the 1973 ceasefire in the Vietnam War.
Under Kissinger, the US opened up relations to China, which is considered one of his biggest successes. He also supported détente, an easing of the rivalry with the Soviets.

Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ were jointly offered the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize for their work on the Paris Peace Accords which lead to the withdrawal of American forces from the Vietnam War. Lê Đức Thọ declined to accept the award saying that peace had not actually been achieved in Vietnam. Kissinger donated his prize money to charity, did not attend the award ceremony and later offered to return his prize medal after the fall of South Vietnam to North Vietnamese forces 18 months later.

In his later years, Kissinger — along with William Perry, Sam Nunn, and George Shultz — called upon governments to reduce nuclear weapons, and in three "Wall Street Journal" articles proposed a program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this cause.

Kissinger died at the age of 100 on November 29, 2023, at his home in Kent, Connecticut. The cause of death was congestive heart failure.

His legacy is often debated by historians. Some people criticize him, even calling him a criminal, for his tactics during the Cold War, notably supporting a military junta in Chile and backing Pakistan during the Bangladesh War. Many people, however, consider Kissinger a great figure in modern American history who ended the Vietnam War, opened up China, and supported peace in the Cold War.

Tsuzuki was born in Heguri, Nara on April 18, 1978. After graduating from Kunimi High School, he joined J1 League side Gamba Osaka in 1997. He became the first choice goalkeeper in 2000 dislodging Hayato Okanaka but he was transferred to Urawa Reds at the end of the 2002 season after a row with manager Akira Nishino. At Reds, he battles with Norihiro Yamagishi for the position. From 2005, he completely played as first goalkeeper except for 2006 for injury. The club won the champions 2006 J1 League, 2003 J.League Cup, 2005 and 2006 Emperor's Cup. In Asia, the club won the champions 2007 AFC Champions League and also won the 3rd place 2007 Club World Cup. However his opportunity to play decreased due to injury from 2009.

In September 2000, Tsuzuki was selected the Japan U-23 national team for 2000 Summer Olympics. But he did not play in the match behind Seigo Narazaki. In February 2001, Tsuzuki was selected the Japan national team for 2001 Confederations Cup. At this tournament, on April 8, he debuted against Brazil. Although he played only one game, Japan won the 2nd place. Because Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi and Seigo Narazaki played most matches for Japan in 2000s, Tsuzuki could hardly play in the match. He played 6 games for Japan until 2009.

Boeremusiek

Boeremusiek is from Europe. It was brought to South Africa and changed into its own style. It is thought to have got to South Africa by British Empire military bands.

Every artist or band comes up with their own sound and style. They make up their own style by playing different types of concertinas and using different instruments in the band. 

A concertina is similar to an accordion and is the lead instrument in most Boeremusiek bands. There are many different types of concertinas, which is why Boeremusiek has so many sounds and styles, and the construction the concertina is what makes the different sounds in the Boeremusiek band; it depends on where the slots and holes are put makes the difference on the sound that the concertina makes. 

Other instruments that might be in a Boeremusiek band are piano accordions, button harmonicas, accordions, pianos, harmoniums and the guitar. Sometimes, a cello or bass guitar may be seen. 

Today, there are many successful Boeremusiek bands that have recorded albums. Some famous bands and individual artists today are Klipwerf Boereorkes, Danie Grey, Nico Carstens, Taffie Kikkilus, Brian Nieuwoudt, Samuel Petzer, Worsie Visser and Die Ghitaar Man.

Military Merit Cross (Austria-Hungary)

The Military Merit Cross (German: "Militärverdienstkreuz", Croatian: "Vojni križ za zasluge") was a decoration of the Empire of Austria and, after the establishment of the Dual Monarchy in 1867, the Empire of Austria-Hungary. It was first established on 22 October 1849 and underwent several revisions to its design and award criteria over the years of its existence. It became obsolete in 1918 with the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Ray Gordy

Terry Ray Gordy, Jr. (born 23 March 1979) is a retired American professional wrestler who is best known for wrestling with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) where he appeared on their SmackDown brand under the ring names Jesse and Slam Master J. In WWE, he was known for tagging with Drew Hankinson where they made the team of Jesse and Festus. He is the son of the wrestler Terry Gordy of the Fabulous Freebirds. Gordy currently works as a police officer in Atlanta, Georgia.

Microsoft Bing

Microsoft Bing (or Bing) is a search engine. It used to be called "Windows Live Search" and "MSN Search". Microsoft calls it a "decision engine", meaning that Bing tries to interpret search queries and give people better search results compared to a typical search engine, helping the user make better decisions. Bing concentrates on four major areas: shopping, travel, local and health. A preview version was made available for everyone to use on June 1, 2009, and the website was fully launched on June 3, 2009. The website quickly became popular after a few weeks.

On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced that Bing would power Yahoo! Search. All Yahoo! Search global customers and partners will be shifted to Bing by early 2012.

In October 2011, Microsoft announced "Tiger", a new internal search computer program for Bing. When it was finished, Bing delivered faster and more relevant search results for users. It has been incorporated into Bing since August 2011.

On February 7, 2023, Microsoft launched a preview version of its Bing search engine, which is powered by OpenAI's artificial intelligence model. The new version of Bing is called "the new Bing" and is customized for search. It includes a chatbot called Microsoft Copilot.

Bing includes the listing of search suggestions as queries are entered. It lists related searches (called "Explore pane") based on semantic technology from Powerset that Microsoft purchased in 2008.

Every day, Bing.com displays a different picture that users can click on parts of to learn more about. These pictures can be about different places around the world, or nature, or even sometimes things in outer space.



Boy Scouts of America

The Boy Scouts of America or BSA is an organization for children and teens with over 5 million members across the United States. They try to give young people life values. BSA includes Cub Scouts, which is for children ages 6–11, Scouts BSA, which is for youth ages 11–17, and Venturing, Sea Scouts, and Exploring for youth ages 14–20. Scouts BSA was called Boy Scouts until it started allowing girls in 2018.

Scouts BSA are ages 11–17 and belong to troops, groups of Scouts associated with a church, school or post. Cub Scouts are scouts ages 6–11 and belong to packs. Cub Scouts include Tigers (age 6-7), Wolfs (age 7-8), Bears (age 8-9), and Webelos (age 9-11). Older Scouts can be Venturer Scouts.

The Boy Scouts of America were founded by American writer W. D. Boyce, in 1910, but were similar to Scouting groups in Great Britain and other early scout movements. James E. West helped out the BSA in its early years, but also made the BSA more religious than scouts were in Europe. Scouting grew in the 1910s and 20s due to the rise of “boy’s books” devoted to Scouting and the First World War. Scouting had many members during the 1960s, but has declined since the 1970s, despite an attempt to make scouting modern by changing requirements and adding more merit badges.

Over the years, the BSA has taken some stands that many Americans did not like. These included being against unions (organized workers) in the 1920s, requiring Scouts to believe in God, and not allowing gays to join Scouting.

An important part of scouting is earning ranks. There are seven ranks in Scouts BSA: Scout, Tenderfoot, 2nd Class, 1st Class, Star, Life and Eagle. The first four focus on learning basic scout skills, including camping, cooking, swimming, first aid (basic medical care), citizenship, orienteering (use of a map and compass), and pioneering (tying knots). The final three focus on earning merit badges, serving the troop and serving the community. Eagle Scouts must plan and finish a project that benefits something other than Scouting, and earn 21 merit badges. They must also hold a position of leadership in the troop. Only about 2 or 3% of Scouts earn Eagle, but some of the ones that have include Gerald Ford and Neil Armstrong.

Scouts must learn, know and follow the Scout Oath and Scout Law:

These are the words of the Scout Oath:

A scout is:


Counterfeit

Counterfeit is the sale or manufacture of items that have not been made by real companies or have been made illegally. Nearly anything can be counterfeit, but most counterfeiting is of clothing and other small items such as bags, medicines, money, watches, or jewellery. Most things can be sold without people realizing that they are counterfeit and that they could possibly be breaking the law by buying the counterfeit goods.

Money can also be counterfeited. Sometimes people make fake cash, and this is considered to be counterfeit. The United States Secret Service investigates people who do this.

Sun Microsystems

Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun for short) was an American company that sold computers, computer components, software, and information technology services. Sun contributed to many important computing technologies, such as Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing. Sun created the Java programming language, the Solaris operating system, the Network File System (NFS), and the SPARC instruction set. Sun was founded on February 24, 1982. Sun's headquarters were in Santa Clara, California. In January 2010, it was bought by Oracle Corporation.

Water strider

The water strider (also known as the pond skater) is a true bug, an insect of the family Gerridae. It can run across the surface of water. It lives on ponds and slow-running streams. It rarely goes underwater. The underside of the body is covered with water-repellent hair. There are around 500 known species, commonly placed in around 60 genera. Also called the Jesus bug (walks on water).

Bowler

A bowler is a person who bowls or delivers a ball to the batsman in the game of cricket. Unlike the pitcher in a game of baseball, a bowler delivers with a straight arm (see photo). A ball bowled with the elbow bent is a throw, and that is illegal. If the bowler bowls while not in the right part of the nonstriker's ground, or bowls the ball out of the reach of the striking batter, that is also illegal. Illegal bowling gives the batting team 1 point, mostly can't get players out, and doesn't count toward the limit on the number of deliveries in the game. 

A bowler who can also bat well, is called an all rounder. There are different types of bowler, and a cricket team will usually have a mix of different types.

A fast bowler uses simple speed to defeat a batsman. They can send the ball to the batsman at a speed of 145 km/h. They take a long run up before bowling each ball to build speed. Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan was the first to bowl at a speed of 160 km/h. Another famous fast bowler is Australian Brett Lee.

A medium pace bowler bowls more slowly. They often use other tricks to defeat the batsman. They can get the ball able to curve in the air or change the speed or length (where the ball hits the ground) to fool the batsman. Some are very accurate so they can repeatedly send the ball to a place which forces the batsman to defend rather than scoring runs. Others grip the ball so that it lands on its seam; this makes the path of the ball unpredictable.

A spin bowler usually bowls quite slowly and puts a lot of spin on the ball which makes it bounce at an angle off the ground. This makes the batsman play each ball carefully. Generally spin bowlers give up the most runs but they all have "tricks" that they use to fool the batsman and get him or her out. These tricks are given names such as the arm ball, googly, flipper, topspinner or doosra. Spin bowling is very much about fooling the batsman rather than speed. A fast off spin is the normal off spin action but with more pace. Off spin is when the cricket ball spins towards a right-handed batsmen's bat (bowler's left to right). With more pace, there usually is less turn (amount of spin). Off-spin is also called an off-break or finger spin. A famous spin bowler was the Australian Shane Warne, but his type was the leg break, which uses the wrist to spin the ball from the bowler's right to left. This is varied with the top spin, when the ball comes on straight and low.

Wicket

In cricket, a wicket is:


There is one wicket in each of the two batsmen's grounds. The fielding team can hit a wicket with the ball to run out a batsman, but only if there is no batsman in the ground of the wicket. In addition, when delivering the ball to the batsman, the bowler can hit the wicket in the striker's ground with the ball to bowl the striker out.

The wicket is said to have been "put down" when any of its 5 sticks fall to the ground because it was hit by the ball or a player holding the ball. The sticks can be put back in place and then hit back off to put the wicket down more than once.

The field can be defined as having two halves: the "off side" and the "leg side"/"on side", with these being separated by an imaginary line connecting the middle stump of both wickets. The off side of the field is the right side of a field for a right-handed batsman who is looking at the bowler, and the leg side is the left side. (This is reversed for a left-handed batsman.)

A batsman is said to have "lost his wicket" when he gets out.

Dynamic and formal equivalence

Dynamic and formal equivalence are concepts from linguistics. 

When a language is translated into another one, there is a problem: the meaning of a word or a phrase in the first language is not the same as that of the word or phrase in the second language. The first language may also have words, phrases or grammatical structures that do not exist in the second language.

There are two possible ways to solve this problem:

The Undertones

The Undertones are a punk rock/power pop band from Northern Ireland. They formed in Derry in 1975. 

Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter

The Luftfahrtgesellschaft Walter or LGW is a German airline. 


3G

3G, the short form for the third generation, is the third generation of wireless mobile telecommunication technology. It was replaced by 4G.
3G was launched on March 3rd 2003 and was replaced in 2009

Kin selection

Kin selection or kin altruism is a form of natural selection. Some animals cooperate with relatives, even if this brings risk to themselves. The classic example of this is seen in the family life of mammals, or in colonial insects such as ants. 

Many mammals and birds raise alarms to warn others of danger. Others cooperate in tasks, such as scrub jays help each other with to build nests. In all these cases where animals cooperate, the question is whether there is any biological benefit to themselves. It is now clear that there is benefit if the animals are closely related. This is because related organisms have (to a degree) a shared genetic inheritance.

The first to write about the concept were by R.A. Fisher in 1930, and J.B.S. Haldane in 1955, but it was W.D. Hamilton who truly formalized the concept. The actual term "kin selection" was probably coined by John Maynard Smith, when he wrote: 

By cooperating, relatives influence each other's fitness. Under natural selection, a gene which improves the fitness of individuals will increase in frequency. A gene which lowers the fitness of individuals will become rare. 

However, behaviour which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the actor, may nonetheless increase in frequency. Relatives do, by definition, carry many of the same genes. This is the fundamental principle behind the theory of kin selection. According to the theory, the enhanced fitness of relatives may more than compensate for the fitness loss of the helpers (individuals displaying the behaviour). 

This is a special case of a more general model, called inclusive fitness.

Hamilton's equation describes whether or not a gene for helping behaviour will spread in a population. The gene will spread if rxb is greater than c:

Foraging

Foraging is the act of hunting or gathering food. For example, cattle forage grass to eat. The idea of animals foraging is called "forage theory", and was first proposed in 1966.

Humans that forage are often called hunter-gatherers, who find and eat (wild) animals and plants without domestication of them (people who farm plants are not hunter-gatherers, as they have grown them themselves). 

Pacific Northwest

The Pacific Northwest, also referred to as Cascadia, is a region on the west coast of North America. It refers to the northwestern corner of the United States and the southwestern part of Canada. The U.S. states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western Montana are in the southern part of the Pacific Northwest. The Canadian province of British Columbia and the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Alaska is in the northern part. The entire region is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west.

Historically, the Pacific Northwest had been inhabited by Native Americans. Starting from about 15,000 years ago, Native Americans settled along the coastline and along the major rivers. From the 1500s to the 1700s, Europeans explored the region, beginning with the discovery of Oregon and Washington. In the early 1800s, the famous Lewis and Clark expedition arrived in Washington State. From the 19th century to present day, the region began to become settled. Today, the largest cities in the Northwest include Vancouver, Seattle and Portland.

The rugged mountains of the Northwest consist of the Coast Range, which is nearer the coast, and the Cascade Range. In northern Washington, the Cascade Range is called the North Cascades. In British Columbia, it is called the Canadian Cascades. The many rivers of the Northwest result from its wet climate - the mountains trap wet Pacific air, leaving little rain for inland states like Idaho. The rivers once supported large salmon runs, but large power dams have been built on many rivers.

The main language of the Pacific Northwest is English in the United States and Canada, among the Native Americans Chinook Jargon is common. Among the many Asian immigrants, Chinese is being used more in the Northwest.

The Pacific Northwest extends from southeastern Alaska to Northern California. Along this entire length, is a large mountain range, the Cascade Range, that forms the geographic spine of the Pacific Northwest. The highest mountain in the Northwest is Mount Rainier. Rainier is high. Other notable mountains include Mount Shasta, at , and Mount Baker, at . East of the Cascades, there is the Columbia Plateau, a high area of land that stretches east to the Rocky Mountains in Idaho and Montana. In the west, the Coast Range borders the coast more closely. The Olympic Mountains are on the Olympic Peninsula, an extension of Washington State. Puget Sound is a large system of bays and straits in northwestern Washington and southeastern British Columbia.

The main rivers of the Pacific Northwest are the Fraser River, the Columbia River, and the Snake River. The Fraser River is mainly in British Columbia; it flows west to the Pacific Ocean near Vancouver. The Fraser drains most of the southern Canadian Cascades. The Columbia River begins in the Canadian Cascades and flows south, then turns west where it meets the Snake River. From there, it flows on to the ocean near Portland. The Snake River is mainly in inland Idaho. After a journey west from the Rocky Mountains, it meets the Columbia at Kennewick, Washington.

Other rivers in the Northwest include the Finlay, the Skagit, the Umpqua, the Rogue, and the Klamath. The Finlay drains the northern Canadian Cascades and flows on to join the Mackenzie River, which flows through Canada to Hudson Bay. The Skagit also begins in the Canadian Cascades, and crosses into Washington; it turns west and flows into the sea north of Everett, Washington. The Umpqua River begins in the Southern Oregon Cascades, and flows west to the Pacific Ocean near Reedsport, Oregon. The Rogue parallels the Umpqua and dumps into the sea at Gold Beach, Oregon. The Klamath flows south from a valley in inland Oregon, then turns west through northern California, cutting through the Cascade Range to its mouth near Klamath, California.


Adaptation

Adaptation is the evolutionary process where an organism becomes better suited to its habitat. This process takes place over many generations. It is one of the basic phenomena of biology.

When people speak about adaptation, they often mean a 'feature' (a trait) which helps an animal or plant survive. An example is the adaptation of horses' teeth to grinding grass. Grass is their usual food; it wears the teeth down, but horses' teeth continue to grow during life. Horses also have adapted to run fast, which helps them to escape their predators, such as lions. These features are the "product" of the process of adaptation.

The illustration of bird beaks shows an obvious sign of their different ways of life. However, eating a different food also means having a different digestive system, gut, claws, wings and above all, different inherited behaviour. For the major adaptations, what changes is not a single trait, but a whole group of features.

Adaptation occurs because the better adapted animals are the most likely to survive, and to reproduce successfully. This process is known as natural selection; it is the basic cause of evolutionary change. 

Adaptation is, first of all, a "process", rather than a physical part of a body. 
Adaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past, and became instead a continuing dynamic process. "Ernst Mayr".

An internal parasite (such as a fluke) is a good example: it has a very simple bodily structure, but still the organism is highly adapted to its particular environment. From this we see that adaptation is not just a matter of visible traits: in such parasites critical adaptations take place in the life cycle, which is often quite complex.

However, as a practical term, adaptation is often used for the "product": those features of a species which result from the process. Many aspects of an animal or plant can be correctly called adaptations, though there are always some features whose function is in doubt. By using the term "adaptation" for the evolutionary "process", and "adaptive trait" for the bodily part or function (the product), the two senses of the word may be distinguished.

Adaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the diverse species we see in biology. The other is speciation (species-splitting or cladogenesis). A favourite example used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of cichlid fish in African lakes.

An organism must be viable at all stages of its development and at all stages of its evolution. This places "constraints" on the evolution of development, behaviour and structure of organisms.

The general idea is that each genetic and phenotypic change during evolution should be relatively small, because developmental systems are so complex and interlinked. But polyploidy in plants is a fairly common large genetic change. The origin of the eukaryota by the symbiosis of micro-organisms is a more exotic example.

All adaptations help organisms survive in their ecological niches. This implies an increase in biological fitness.

These adaptive traits may be structural, behavioural or physiological. Structural adaptations are physical features of an organism (shape, body covering, armament; and also the internal organization).

Behavioural adaptations are composed of inherited behaviour chains and/or the ability to learn: behaviours may be inherited in detail (instincts), or a tendency for learning may be inherited (see neuropsychology). Examples: searching for food, sex, vocalizations.

Physiological adaptations permit the organism to perform special functions (for instance, making venom, secreting slime, phototropism); but also more general functions such as growth and development, temperature regulation, ionic balance and other aspects of homeostasis. Adaptation, then, affects all aspects of the life of an organism.

Important adaptations do not come singly. They come in groups, which work together to make the animal or plant successful in its particular niche or life-style.

Woodpecker adaptations are a good example of how a whole suite of features are needed for a successful way of life.

Ancestral woodpeckers, which switched to climbing on tree trunks, had ancestral foot and tail structure. This suggests that a change in behaviour, perhaps to get at a better food source, was one of the first things that happened in the chain of events. The way evolutionary novelties start is an important topic.

Not all features of an organism are adaptations. It may need field investigations or experiments to find out whether it has a function in the life of the species.

Adaptations tend to reflect the past life of a species. If a species has recently changed its life style, a once valuable adaptation may become a dwindling vestige. Animals which live in dark caves often lose, over a long period, their colours and eyesight. 

The reasons for this may vary. The loss of structure and function may be a positive adaptation which saves energy and materials. But it may be simply a by-product of genes selected for other functions (pleiotropy). Or the structure may be linked in development, and affected by selection for some other structure. 

It is a general rule that any adaptations which are no longer useful either become vestigial organs (see vermiform appendix), or may be selected and adapted to other functions (see ear ossicles).

Many adaptations serve more than one function. This is often the reason some traits become so noticeable that they almost define the species concerned. The legs of a horse are also a main defence: a horse's kick is very destructive. The antlers of male deer serve a sexual function as well as a defence against predators. Man's large brain serves not only for language, but also for thinking and problem-solving. Bird feathers are not just used to fly; they are the basis of its heat conservation, temperature regulation and signalling

It is a profound truth that Nature does not know best; that genetical evolution... is a story of waste, makeshift, compromise and blunder. "Peter Medawar".
Adaptations are never perfect. There are always tradeoffs between the various functions and structures in a body. It is the organism as a whole which lives and reproduces, therefore it is the complete set of adaptations which gets passed on to future generations.
All adaptations have a downside: horse legs are great for running on grass, but they cannot scratch their backs; mammals' hair helps temperature regulation, but offers a niche for ectoparasites. Compromise and make-shift occur widely, not perfection. Selection pressures pull in different directions, and the adaptation that results is some kind of compromise.
Since the phenotype as a whole is the target of selection, it is impossible to improve simultaneously all aspects of the phenotype to the same degree. "Ernst Mayr".

Camouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid colours are displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the need for reproduction. The peacock's ornamental train (grown anew in time for each mating season) is a famous adaptation. It must reduce his maneuverability and flight, and is hugely conspicuous; also, its growth costs food resources.

Darwin's explanation of its advantage was in terms of sexual selection: "it depends on the advantage which certain individuals have over other individuals of the same sex and species, in relation to reproduction". The kind of sexual selection represented by the peacock is called 'mate choice', meaning the process selects the more fit over the less fit, and so has survival value. In practice, the blue peafowl "Pavo cristatus" is a pretty successful species, with a big natural range in India, so the overall outcome of their mating system is quite viable.

The size of the human foetal brain at birth means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The newborn's brain cannot be larger than about 400ccs, else it will not get through the mother's pelvis. Yet the size needed for an adult brain is about 1400ccs.

The most vital things in human life (locomotion, speech) just have to wait while the brain grows and matures. That is the result of the birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem.

The function of a trait can, and often does, change over time. Several terms have been used to describe this: "preadaptation", "exaptation", "cooption". 'Preadaptation' is the most common term used when a preexisting structure or trait inherited from an ancestor evolves a different function. It was the term used by Julian Huxley and Ernst Mayr. The term 'pre-' does not mean any foresight, it just means the adaptation was already available, serving some older function. 'Exaptation' was Stephen J. Gould's word.

One example of preadaptation is in dinosaurs, which evolved feathers with the function of thermo-insulation and display long before they were used for flight by early birds. Sweat glands in mammals were later transformed into mammary glands. Another example is the long journey of the mammalian ear ossicles, which started in the gill covers of ancient fish, then became part of the lower jaw of reptiles, and then became part of the inner ear of mammals. Another example is the wings of penguins. Once used for flying, they are now used for 'flying' under water.

Change of function in organs and structures is extremely common in evolution. Many of the features of tetrapods (land vertebrates) evolved from features with different functions in the ancestral lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii).

The following definitions are mainly due to Theodosius Dobzhansky.


Amaranth (color)

Amaranth is a rose-red color that is the color of the flower of the amaranth plant.

The first written use of "amaranth" as a color name in English was in 1690.

The name "amaranth" comes from the Greek "a" (not) + "marainean" (to waste away). A flower that never died that was believed to grow on Mount Olympus.
Amaranth flowers come in many different colors:

Cobra Starship

Cobra Starship was an American alternative dance band. The group started in 2005 in New York City. They are most famous for their songs "Snakes on a Plane (Bring It)" and "Good Girls Go Bad". They are currently signed to record label Fueled by Ramen.

Cobra Starship officially dissolved on November 10, 2015.



San Felipe de Puerto Plata

The Dominican city of San Felipe de Puerto Plata, usually called just Puerto Plata is the head municipality of the Puerto Plata province, on the north (Atlantic) coast of the country.

The name Puerto Plata ("Silver Port") came from the name given by Columbus to the mountain just to the south of the city: "Monte de Plata" ("Silver Mountain") because the mountain always had clouds on its top and not because there was the metal silver; that mountain now is called Isabel de Torres mountain (in Spanish, the complete name is "Loma Isabel de Torres"). Isabel de Torres was a lady who lived in Puerto Plata in 1605 and had a lot of land in the mountain.

The city was called first "Puerto de Plata" but later it was changed to just "Puerto Plata", the name that is still used

Columbus visited the Puerto Plata Bay on 11 January 1493. The city was founded and built by Nicolás de Ovando in 1502. Soon it became the most important port in the northern coast of the Hispaniola island and, in 1508, the king of Spain gave a coat of arms to the city.

Because there were many pirates and other British and French ships along the northern coast of the island, a fort was built here by orders of Carlos I, king of Spain; its construction took several years and it was finished in 1577. Because at that moment the Spanish's king was Felipe II, the fort was named Fuerte San Felipe (in English, "Saint Phillip Fort").

In 1606, those that were living in the towns of Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were ordered by the Spanish king to move to the southeast of the island and to found a new town: Monte Plata. Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were, then, destroyed. They were founded again in the 18th century with families that came from the Canary Islands.

The municipality had, in , a total population of 128,240: 63,564 men and 64,676 women. The urban population was of the total population.

San Felipe de Puerto Plata has a total area of (without including its municipal districts), about of the total area of the province of Puerto Plata. The city is at an elevation of , and at to the north of Santo Domingo.

The "Cordillera Septentrional" ("Northern mountain range") runs along the southern half of the municipality. There are only two roads that go through this mountain range. It rains a lot in these mountains.

The mountain "Loma Isabel de Torres" (the "Monte de Plata" of Columbus) is at about to the southeast of the city of Puerto Plata. It stands alone even if it is part of the Cordillera Septentrional. On top of the mountain, there is rainforest because it gets a lot of rain there; it rains almost every day. That forest is now a national park. It is high and there are two ways for getting to the top: by road or by a cable car (a type of car that runs on cables above the car).

There are many rivers in the municipality but, because the Cordillera Septentrional is close to the coast, they are all very short. The two most important rivers are Camú del Norte and Yásica. Two small rivers that are close to the city are San Marcos and Muñoz.

There are some bays along the coast. Two of them are the "Puerto Plata Bay" and "Maimón Bay".

Puerto Plata has a tropical wet climate (Köppen-Geiger classification: Af) with no dry or cold season as it is constantly moist (rainfalls during the whole year).

The average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is . The month with the most precipitation on average is December with of rainfall, followed by November with .

The driest season is summer. The month with the least rainfall on average is July with an average of and the second is June with .

Puerto Plata is in a warm region; the average temperature for the year is . The warmest month, on average, is July with an average temperature of . The coolest month on average is February, with an average temperature of .

The municipality of San Felipe de Puerto Plata has two municipal districts:

North Cascades

The North Cascades are a name used for the mountains at the north end of the Cascade Range, south of Canada. The North Cascades are entirely in the United States, in the state of Washington. At the Canadian border, the North Cascades are called the Canadian Cascades. The highest point in the North Cascades is Mount Baker (10,781 ft/3,286m). North Cascades National Park is located at the northernmost end of the North Cascades.

Some of the primary rivers in the North Cascades are the Skagit, Nooksack, Stillaguamish, and Stehekin. Lake Chelan is the largest lake in the North Cascades. Although now termed a reservoir, it was originally a natural lake, but enlarged by a dam. The urban areas of Seattle, Tacoma and Everett are all west of the North Cascades. The Columbia River, Washington's largest river, forms the east and south boundary.

The Point!

The Point! is a 1971 animated cartoon movie, written by singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson and Carole Beers, and directed by Fred Wolf. It first appeared on ABC television, in the United States. It starred the voices of Mike Lookinland ("Bobby" of "The Brady Bunch" fame), and actor Dustin Hoffman. (Later editions replaced Hoffman's voice with that of Alan Thicke, then musician Ringo Starr.)

"The Point!" tells a story about a boy named Oblio (Mike Lookinland), who is the only round-headed person in a land full of people and animals with pointed heads. Banished to the Pointless Forest for not conforming to what is "normal", Oblio and his dog Arrow (Don Messick) (whose head was pointed, but he was still loyal to Oblio) meet many different people, and come to learn that everything and everyone indeed has a "point"; a purpose for being what they are. Oblio and Arrow return home, bringing back what they have learned to share with everyone.

Harry Nilsson said later the inspiration for "The Point!" was an LSD experience. Resting on the ground, he noticed everything (trees, buildings) that reached into the sky from the ground came to a "point", leading Nilsson to believe that "everything has a point, and if it doesn't, then there's a point to that". Nilsson developed this idea into a story about tolerance, and acceptance of uniqueness in others.


Nilsson devoted a whole album to music from "The Point!", alternating songs from the show with his own of the story. "Me And My Arrow" became the breakout hit from the album, with a single reaching the Top 20 in the American music charts. (The song was later used in a commercial, for the Plymouth Arrow automobile.)

Nilsson later adapted "The Point!" into a musical stage play, that featured more of his own songs. A London production of the play reunited former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, who were also friends of Nilsson's.

Darwinius

Darwinius is a genus of primates known from only one fossil. It was discovered in 1983 by an amateur at the Messel Pit. This is a disused shale quarry noted for its astonishing fossil preservation, near the village of Messel, about 35 km (22 miles) southeast of Frankfurt am Main in Germany.

The fosssil dates from the Eocene epoch, 47 million years ago. The genus "Darwinius" was named to celebrate Charles Darwin on his bicentenary and the species name "masillae" honors Messel, where the specimen was found. The creature appeared superficially similar to a modern lemur. It is the only known specimen of its species.

The fossil, nicknamed 'Ida', was divided into a slab and partial counterslab after the excavation. The two parts were sold separately, was not reassembled until 2007. 

The specimen was privately collected and sold in two parts. Only the lesser part was known earlier. The second part shows that the skeleton is the complete primate fossil known. It includes the skeleton, soft body outline and contents of the digestive tract. 

Skull radiography shows teeth developing within the juvenile face. The individual was a weaned and independent-feeding female that died in her first year of life. She was "an agile, nail-bearing, generalized arboreal quadruped living above the floor of the Messel rain forest".

Redmond Barry

Redmond Barry (1813—1880), was a judge in Victoria, Australia. He is famous for being the person who started the University of Melbourne and the State Library of Victoria. As a judge he is famous for sentencing bushranger Ned Kelly to death. He was also the judge in the trials of the rebel miners from the Eureka Stockade in Ballarat, Victoria.

Transport network

A transport network, or transportation network is a network of roads, railways, streets, pipes, power lines, or any structure that lets either movement of vehicles or flow of some commodity.

Buxton

Buxton is a spa town in Derbyshire, England. It is the highest market town in England. Buxton is near to Cheshire and Staffordshire. Buxton is described as "the gateway to the Peak District National Park". Buxton is also close to Manchester.

"Poole's Cavern", a limestone cavern, and St Ann's Well are in Buxton. Also in the town is an Opera House.

The Romans developed the town when it was called Aquae Arnemetiae (or the spa of the goddess of the grove). Roman coins have been found in Buxton. The town largely grew in importance in the late 18th century when it was developed by the Dukes of Devonshire, with a second revival a hundred years later as the people visited to use the healing properties of the waters.

The Dukes of Devonshire have been helping Buxton since 1780, when the Duke used his money from his copper mines to develop the town as a spa like Bath.

Bess of Hardwick had taken one of her four husbands, the Earl of Shrewsbury, to "take the waters" at Buxton shortly after he became the jailer of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1569.

Dr. Erasmus Darwin recommended the waters at Buxton to Josiah Wedgwood. The Wedgwood family often went to Buxton on holiday. Two of Charles Darwin's half-cousins, Edward Levett Darwin and Reginald Darwin also settled there.


Buxton is twinned with two other towns—Oignies in France and Bad Nauheim in Germany.


Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll is an 1865 childrens’ story written by Charles Dodgson and illustrated by John Tenniel. Dodgson used Lewis Carroll as a pen name when writing poetry and fiction.

The story is more well known as Alice in Wonderland and is the basis for many adaptations in films, art and music.

One of the very commonly used phrases today - “down the rabbit hole” - comes from the beginning of the story. Alice is a young girl who, while falling asleep outside on a golden afternoon, sees a white rabbit and follows it into a rabbit hole. When she falls down the rabbit hole, she begins her fantastical adventures in Wonderland. 

Her adventures include distortions of time and proportion. Throughout the story she shrinks and grows repeatedly as she meets characters of all kinds and sizes, including the iconic Caterpillar who asks “Who are you?” and Cheshire Cat who asks her “Where do you want to go?”

The story starts with Alice sitting with her sister beside a lake. Suddenly, a white rabbit runs by. Alice runs after him. She finds his rabbit hole. She falls through the hole. She meets many characters underground and has some amazing adventures. She grows larger or smaller by eating different things like cakes and mushrooms. At the end, she enters a lovely garden. The Knave of Hearts is charged with stealing some tarts. A trial is held. Alice thinks the trial is ridiculous. She says so. Everyone is offended. There is a great commotion. Alice suddenly wakes up. She is back where she started, sitting with her sister beside the lake.

The story was told on a summer outing to three little girls. One of them was named Alice Liddell. Alice asked Dodgson to write the story down. Dodgson accepted the task. It took two years.

The story was first called "Alice's Adventures Under Ground". When Dodgson prepared the "Alice" story for publication, he added more events, such as the Mad Hatters's Tea Party, new characters, such as the Cheshire Cat, and changed the title to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".

The story was so popular that Dodgson, (under the pen name Lewis Carroll), wrote a sequel called "Through the Looking-Glass". The Alice stories, often known as "Alice in Wonderland", are popular in music, movies and plays.

The book has been adapted many times to movies and television. These adaptations include:


Penny sterling

The penny sterling (plural "pence") is a subdivision of Pound sterling, the currency for the United Kingdom.

Montreal Wanderers

The Montreal Wanderers were a professional men's ice hockey team that played in Montreal, Quebec at the Montreal Arena, and were one of the founding franchises of the National Hockey League in the 1917–18 NHL season. The Wanderers won a total of eight Stanley Cup challenges within a span of five seasons from 1906 to 1910. Prior to the formation of the NHL, the "Redbands" were one of the most successful teams in hockey.

£sd

£sd (pronounced, and sometimes written, L.s.d.) was the popular name for the pre-decimal currencies (sterling) used in the United Kingdom and in most of the British Empire. This abbreviation meant “pounds, shillings, and pence”. It is different when compared to American currency.

Quebec Bulldogs

The Quebec Bulldogs were a men's senior-level ice hockey team officially known as the Quebec Hockey Club, later as the Quebec Athletic Club. Their recorded play goes back as far as the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) in 1889, although the Quebec Hockey Club is known to have played in tournaments prior to that date. The club continued as an amateur team through various leagues, eventually becoming professional in 1908, and eventually playing in the National Hockey League. The "Bulldog" name was given by the media and was so popular with the fans a Bulldog mascot was created but was never officially changed until the team moved to Hamilton, Ontario in 1920 and became the Tigers.

Three-body problem

The three-body problem is a problem in the field of physics. The goal is to find how three things move when they attract each other with gravity. It would be for instance the problem of the movement of the Sun, the Earth and the Moon. Physicists do not have a general solution that always works.

"Relativistic" refers to the theory of Albert Einstein called Relativity. This theory must be used when things move at great speed. But as long as things move at small enough speed, you can use every day classical mechanics, and this is called "non-relativistic movement". You know if the speed is great or small enough by comparing to the speed of light "c," which is the highest possible speed.

In non-relativistic physics, one must know the place and velocity of the three things. One must also know their masses. Then one uses Newton's laws of motion to learn how the things move.

When a thing is moving, it has energy of movement. Scientists use a short-cut when they talk about this energy, they call it 'E.'

In a field called General relativity, experts say that movement with higher velocities causes the radiation of gravitational waves. In this case, the thing moving loses energy, and this makes calculation more difficult. Experts say that the system is "not conservative".

Experts in another field called Quantum mechanics say, in addition, at high speed the creation and annihilation of particles becomes possible, so, it is not possible to keep the number of particles constant.

There is no relativistic solution that always works for the movement of two or three things.

The three-body problem also happens in astronomy. The problem consists in calculating the course of three bodies, that influence each other with gravitation. The first to state the problem was Isaac Newton, in "Principia". Usually, two of the bodies are large, and the third is small. In the case where the two bodies have the same gravitational force, and that the bodies all have the same mass can be solved exactly. If this is not the case, the problem is solved through iteration and approximation. Many different patterns of motion can occur.

Yossi Benayoun

Yossi Benayoun (; born 5 May 1980) is an Israeli football player. He currently plays for Chelsea in the Premier League. Benayoun plays as an attacking midfielder, and he is the captain of the Israeli national team.

Plum Warner

Sir Pelham Francis Warner, known as Plum, (born 2 October 1873 in Port of Spain, Trinidad – died 30 January 1963 at West Lavington, West Sussex), was an England cricketer and a tour manager for England. He was tour manager during the 1932-33 "bodyline" tour of Australia where England bowled high and fast balls to the body of the Australian batsman, especially the famous Don Bradman.

Douglas Jardine

Douglas Robert Jardine (Bombay, Indian Empire 1900 – Montreux, Switzerland 1958) was an English cricketer and captain of the England cricket team from 1931 to 1933–34. A right-handed batsman, he played 22 Test matches for England, captaining the side in 15 matches, winning nine, losing one and drawing five.

Jardine is best known for captaining the English team during the 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia. There, his team used 'bodyline' tactics against Donald Bradman and other opposing Australian batsmen. A bodyline delivery was one where the cricket ball was pitched short so as to rise towards the body of the opposing batsman on the line of the leg stump. The plan was to get legside deflections that could be caught by one of several fielders on the leg side. This tactic was considered by many to be intimidatory and physically threatening. Jardine is widely regarded by commentators and writers as the person responsible for that strategy.

The spearhead of the England attack was the coal miner's son Harold Larwood, the fastest bowler of the day. Larwood's partner was Bill Voce, also a top-class fast bowler. Ranged against them was the great Don Bradman, then averaging over 100 in Test matches.

A controversial figure among cricketers, Jardine was well known for his dislike of Australian players and crowds. In return, he was unpopular in Australia, for his manner and the bodyline strategy. Many of his players thought him an excellent captain, though not everyone thought him as good at managing people.

Jardine joined the British Army in August 1939. Once World War II began, he was commissioned into the Royal Berkshire Regiment and went with the British Expeditionary Force to France. He served at Dunkirk, where he was fortunate to escape but suffered some injuries. After serving as staff captain at St. Albans, he was posted to India for the remainder of the war. He served in Quetta, and then Simla, as a major. He became fluent in the Hindustani language. He gave lectures and played some cricket while in India. He left the army in 1945.

The Oval

The Oval is a place in London, England where important cricket matches are played. The Oval is the home place for Surrey County Cricket Club when they play other counties and England often play their last home test matches there at the end of the summer.

The Oval is located in Kennington, South London. The nearest tube station is also called Oval but you can get to the place easily from Vauxhall station.

Trophallaxis

Trophallaxis in biology refers the sharing of food by members of a community. 

It is most highly developed in social insects such as ants, termites, wasps and bees. The word was introduced by the entomologist William Morton Wheeler in 1918. The behaviour has been used to explain theories of how social behaviour developed in insects. The French psychologist and entomologist August Forel also believed that food sharing was key to ant society. He used an illustration of it as the frontispiece for his book "The social world of the ants compared with that of man".

Trophallaxis serves as a means of communication, at least in bees and ants. In some species of ants, it may play a role in spreading the colony odour that identifies members.

Oval tube station

Oval tube station in Kennington is a station on the Northern line of the London Underground. It is between Stockwell and Kennington stations. It is the only station on the Morden branch of the Northern line whose name begins with a vowel. Oval station is in Travelcard Zone 2. It is named for The Oval, which it serves.


Nikolaus Harnoncourt

Nikolaus Harnoncourt (born Berlin, 6 December 1929, died St. Georgen im Attergau, 5 March 2016) was an Austrian conductor. He was famous for his conducting music from many years ago using orchestras with period instruments.

Harnoncourt was born in Berlin into a noble family who were related to the Holy Roman Emperors and other European royalties. His full name was Johann Nicolaus Graf de la Fontaine und d’Harnoncourt-Unverzag. He was brought up in Graz, Austria and studied music in Vienna.

From 1952 to 1969 he was a cellist with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. He soon became interested in performing old music with period instruments. He started a group called Concentus Musicus Wien. They tried to make the music of composers from the Baroque period sound like it had done when it was written. Harnoncourt played the viola da gamba as well as the cello. In 1970 he conducted Monteverdi's opera "Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria" at La Scala, Milan.

In 1971, Harnoncourt started to work with the conductor Gustav Leonhardt. They recorded all of J.S. Bach's cantatas. This project took until 1990 to finish. He also recorded Bach's "St. Matthew Passion". He performed with many other orchestras, including the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Often they were orchestras who used modern instruments, but he tried to make them play with an understanding of a historical style (bowing, phrasing etc). Like other musicians working with historical instruments, he gradually realized that music from later periods such as the Classical music period and even the Romantic period used to sound different from what we usually hear today. He recorded the symphonies and concertos of Beethoven. He received many awards for these recordings.

Harnoncourt was married to Alice until his death. The couple had a daughter, Elisabeth von Magnus, and three sons: Philipp, Franz and Eberhard (who died in 1990). Harnoncourt retired in December 2015 because of an illness. Harnoncourt died on 5 March 2016 from the illness. He was aged 86.



Roger Norrington

Sir Roger Norrington OBE (born 16 March 1934) is a British conductor who is famous for conducting music from historical periods using period instruments.

Norrington studied at Clare College, Cambridge and the Royal College of Music where his teachers included Adrian Boult.

Norrington started his career singing tenor. In 1962 he formed the Schütz Choir (later the Schütz Choir of London). From 1969 to 1984, he was conductor (music director) of Kent Opera. In 1978 he formed the London Classical Players and he conducted them until 1997. From 1985 to 1989 he was Principal Conductor of the Bournemouth Sinfonietta. From 1990 to 1994, he was music director of the Orchestra of St. Luke's. In 1998, he became principal conductor of the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra. He became Artistic Advisor of the Handel and Haydn Society in 2006.

Norrington is best known for performances of Baroque, Classical and Romantic music using period instruments and period style. He likes his orchestras to play with very little vibrato.

He conducted the Last Night of The Proms for the first time on 13 September 2008.

Norrington was made an OBE in 1980, a CBE in 1990 and a Knight Bachelor in 1997.

Surrey County Cricket Club

Surrey County Cricket Club are a cricket team who play first class county leagues. They play their home games at The Oval in Kennington, South London.

Gustav Leonhardt

Gustav Leonhardt (born 's-Graveland, Netherlands, 30 May 1928, died Amsterdam, 16 January 2012) was a famous Dutch harpsichordist, organist and conductor who became well known for playing music from historical periods on period instruments. At the beginning of his career the harpsichord was not yet a popular instrument and music from the Renaissance and Baroque periods was usually played in the same way as music from later centuries. Gustav Leonhardt made his audiences aware of what music by Johann Sebastian Bach would have sounded like in Bach's day.

Gustav Leonhardt was born into a Dutch, Protestant family who lived in the countryside. His Protestantism was an important part of his life. His father was a wealthy business man. His parents were both very keen amateur musicians. When Gustav was ten they bought a harpsichord. When World War II broke out life was hard in the country and Leonhardt often had to hide under the floorboards so that he was not sent away to slave labour. When he was not hiding he spent a lot of time practising the harpsichord. 

Gustav Leonhardt studied organ and harpsichord at the Schola Cantorum in Basel. At that time this was the only place in Europe where it was possible to study how to play early music. He went to Vienna to study conducting because his parents thought that being a conductor was a good way to earn a lot of money. However, Gustav was never very keen on conducting and he spent all his time there in the library studying music scores and copying music out. Most of this music had never been published and had not been performed since the time it was composed. 

In 1952 he became professor of harpischord at the Vienna Hochschule fur Musik. He met Nikolaus Harnoncourt who had similar interests to his. He soon became professor of harpsichord at the Amsterdam Conservatorium and remained there until 1988. He was also organist at the Waalse Kerk, Amsterdam. This church has a very famous historical organ. He became well known for his harpsichord concerts and recordings. He led the Leonhardt Baroque Ensemble with the English counter-tenor Alfred Deller with whom he made one of the first recordings of some Bach cantatas. The ensemble included his wife Marie, as well as Nikolaus Harnoncourt who played the cello. Together with Harnoncourt he conducted and recorded all Bach's cantatas.

Leonhardt lived in a big 16th century house facing one of the canals in the centre of Amsterdam. He looked very serious on the concert platform, but he had a sense of humour and occasionally played a bit of ragtime at the end of a recital.

Leonhardt died in Amsterdam on 16 January 2012.


Vienna Symphony

The Vienna Symphony () is an orchestra in Vienna, Austria.

The orchestra was formed in 1900 by the conductor Ferdinand Löwe. It was then called the "Wiener Concertverein" (Vienna Concert Society). In 1913 it moved into the Konzerthaus, Vienna. In 1919 it joined with the Tonkünstler Orchestra. In 1933 it got the name it has today: Vienna Symphony (Wiener Symphoniker).

During World War II the Nazis forced them to be part of the German Culture Orchestras and they were used for propaganda. They stopped playing in 1944.

Their first concert after the war was on 16 September 1945, when they performed Gustav Mahler's "Symphony No. 3". Their conductor Josef Krips quickly helped them to become a great orchestra. From 1946 they were often conducted by Herbert von Karajan who toured with them throughout Europe and North America. In 1959 the VSO performed for Pope John XXIII at Vatican City.

When Wolfgang Sawallisch became their conductor he toured with them to the United States and Japan.

Today Fabio Luisi is their chief conductor.




Liber Linteus

The Liber Linteus Zagrabiensis (or Liber Agramensis) (Latin: "Linen Book of Zagreb" or "Book of Agram") is the longest Etruscan text and the only existing linen book. 

Most of the text has not been translated, because the Etruscan language is only known little. According to the few words that can be understood, the text is probably a ritual calendar.

The fabric of the book was preserved when it was used to wrap a mummy from Ptolemaic Egypt. The mummy and the manuscript are now kept in a refrigerated room at the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb, Croatia.


Eel River

The Eel River is a river in the north part of the U.S. state of California. It flows north about 200 mi (322 km) to the Pacific Ocean, draining 3,684 square miles (9,542 square km). Its largest tributary is the Middle Fork Eel River, followed by the South Fork, Van Duzen River, and North Fork. The river is dammed near its headwaters to divert water into the Russian River valley. The two dams form Van Arsdale Reservoir and the larger Lake Pillsbury. Most of the river is in the humid Coast Ranges of California. Much of the river is isolated, in steep and rugged terrain. 

Towns along the Eel include Ferndale, Rio Dell, and Dos Rios (at the confluence with the Middle Fork). Weott is near the South Fork confluence.

U.S. Highway 101 follows the river until the South Fork confluence, and the Great Northern Railway also follows a portion of the river. 37 bridges cross the Eel and 24 cross the South Fork. The South Fork is the longest tributary. The Middle Fork has the largest watershed.

Cultivar

A cultivar is a variant of a plant that has been selected for planting and sale because it has certain characteristics. It keeps its traits when it is propagated because they are inherited. 

Usually, cultivars are given a name which is not related to their biological taxon. There is a system of naming run by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (the ICNCP), commonly known as the Cultivated Plant Code. 


Plant propagation

Plant propagation is when a plant is distributed. There are several ways to do this:

Cardamom

Cardamom is the name used for two herbs related to ginger. Their seeds are used as a spice. The two species are named "Elettaria" and "Amomum". The seeds grow in a small seedpod. This seedpod is triangular in cross-section and has the shape of a spindle. There is a thin papery outer shell and small black seeds. Elettaria pods are light green in color, Amomum pods are larger and dark brown.

Elettaria is commonly known as "cardamom", "green cardamom" or "true cardamom". It grows from India to Malaysia. 

Amomum is usually called "black cardamom", or "white cardamom". It grows in Asia and Australia.

Both forms of cardamom are used to add flavor to both food and drink, as cooking spices and as a medicine. 
"Elettaria cardamomum" (the usual type of cardamom) is used as a spice and in medicine; it is also smoked sometimes; it is used as a food plant by the larva of the moth "Endoclita hosei".

Cardamom has a strong taste and an intense smell. Black cardamom has coolness similar to that of mint. It is commonly used in Pakistani cooking. In Scandinavia it is often used for baking. 

Green cardamom is one of the most expensive spices by weight but little is needed to give the flavor. Cardamom is best stored in pod form. Once the seeds are exposed or ground, they quickly lose their flavor. High-quality ground cardamom powder can often be a substitute for the pods. That way, ten pods is about the same quantity as one and a half teaspoons of ground cardamom. 

In the Middle East, green cardamom powder is used as a spice for sweet dishes. Traditionally, it is also added as a flavoring to coffee and tea there. In Arabic, cardamom is called "al-Hayl". In Persian, it is called "hel". In Hebrew, it is also called "hel" (הל). In Gujarati (a derivative of Sanskrit), it is "Ē-lī-chē".
In some Middle Eastern countries, coffee and cardamom are often ground in a wooden mortar and cooked together in a mihbaz, an oven using wood or gas, to produce mixtures that are as much as forty percent cardamom.

In South Asia, green cardamom is often used in traditional Pakistani sweets and in "Masala chai (spiced tea)". 

Black cardamom is sometimes used in garam masala for curries. It is occasionally used as a garnish in basmati rice and other dishes. It is often referred to as fat cardamom due its size ('Moti Elaichi'). Individual seeds are sometimes chewed, in much the same way as chewing-gum. It has also been known to be used to make gin. Cardamom was used to make the spiced wine, claret, in the Middle Ages.

In South Asia, Green cardamom is often used to treat infections of the teeth and gums. It is also used against troubles of the throat, congestion of the lungs and pulmonary tuberculosis, inflammation of eyelids and also digestive disorders. It has been used to break up kidney and gall stones, and as an antidote against the poison of certain snake bites. 

"Amomum" is used as a spice and as an ingredient in traditional medicine in systems of the traditional Chinese medicine in China, in Ayurveda in India, Japan, Korea and Vietnam.
Among other species, varieties and cultivars, "Amomum villosum" cultivated in China, Laos and Vietnam is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat stomach-aches, constipation, dysentery, and other digestion problems. "Tsaoko" cardamom "Amomum tsao-ko" is cultivated in Yunnan, China and northwest Vietnam, both for medicinal purposes and as a spice.

The demand for these herbs has increased since the 1980s. Growing cardamom has become an important source of income for many poor farmers. These people usually live in higher altitudes, sometimes in remote areas, in China, Laos and Vietnam. 

Until recently, Nepal has been the world's largest producer of large cardamom. Guatemala has become the world's largest producer and exporter of cardamom, with an export total of US$137.2 million for 2007.

Developed country

A developed country (also known as an industrialised country or more economically developed country (MEDC)) is a country that has more businesses and infrastructures (roads, airports, electricity, etc) than a developing country. The numbers most used for measuring economic growth is gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income (average money per person). Others include the amount of industry, how much infrastructure there is, literacy, life expectancy and the basic standard of living. There is no exact way of saying what country is developed or developing. People often discuss the question of whose countries are the most developed ones,

Developed countries have , which means that the service sector becomes more important, and the is less important. Service sector jobs are those where a person does something for another, like selling or fixing a product. Industry sector jobs are actually making a product, usually in a factory. In a developed country, industry jobs may be moved (outsourced) to less developed countries that pay workers less money. Developing countries may be in the process of industrialization (building the factories and infrastructure) and underdeveloped countries usually depend on agriculture, often subsistence farming.

The first industrialised country was the UK, followed by Belgium. Later industrialised countries were Germany, the US, France and other Western European countries. According to , the current split between the developed and developing world is mostly an event of the 20 century.

According to the International Monetary Fund, developed countries supplied over half of the global GDP in 2010. In 2012, the "major advanced economies" were the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Italy, and Canada. These are also called the G7.

The G7 has 10% of the world's population, but produces nearly 40% of the world's GDP. They also control many of the economic decisions that affect the world. The United Nations Security Council has five permanent members, four of those are in the G8 (G7 plus Russia).

Terms similar to "developed country" include "advanced country", "industrialised country", "more developed country (MDC), "more economically developed country (MEDC) (compared to "less economically developed country(LEDC)"), "Global North country", "first-world country", and " country". 

Economic criteria are usually seen as most important. This includes income per capita (average money for each person). Countries with high GDP per capita and mature industrialization are described as "developed countries". But modernization is not always seen as the only way to measure progress.

Recently, another measure, the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines jobs, income, along with access to medicine, life expectancy, and education has become prominent. The UN HDI is measures a country's level of human development. While there is a strong connection between a high HDI score and a prosperous economy, it is not always the case. The top 47 countries by HDI have scores ranging from 0.793 in Barbados to 0.955 in Norway. Many countries having an HDI of 0.788 and over (as of 2010), are also listed by IMF or CIA as "advanced" (as of 2009). The country of Bhutan started the idea of Gross National Happiness (GNH), to measure how happy people actually are. They felt the GNH was as important as GDP, and this idea has spread beyond Bhutan.

Market town

A market town is a settlement in Europe that has the right to have markets. This separates them from villages and cities. A town may be described as a market town or as having market rights even if it does not have a market anymore, provided the right to do so still holds.

Moped

A moped is a vehicle with two wheels and a motor, like a motorcycle but smaller. It usually has pedals, like a bicycle.

The size of the motor is usually 49cc, much smaller than most motorcycle motors. Because of the small motor, mopeds usually can not go faster than 50 kph (30 mph). Mopeds use less fuel than motorcycles, but some people complain that mopeds create more air pollution than motorcycles. Most of the time, you need a special license to ride a motorcycle but you only need an ordinary driver's license to ride a moped. It is usually illegal to ride a moped without a helmet.

Algorithmic information theory

Algorithmic information theory is a field of theoretical computer science. It is concerned with how information and computation are related. Most information can be represented as a String (or a sequence of characters). Algorithmic information theory studies the complexity of information represented that way (In other words, how difficult it is to get that information, or how long it takes). Unlike regular information theory, it uses Kolmogorov complexity to describe complexity, and not the measure of complexity developed by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver. Kolmogorov complexity was developed independently by Andrey Kolmogorov and Gregory Chaitin .

According to Claude Shannon the following two binary strings have the same content in information (this is only valid for the first-order entropy):

The first was generated with a random number generator, for example by throwing a coin. The second is easier to describe (eight times "1", then eight times "0"). For this reason, the first sequence has more algorithmic information, because it is harder to shorten ("compress") the description on how to generate it. Shortening the description may not be possible at all. The information value of a string is higher, if it is more difficult to shorten ("compress") its description. Random strings and white noise do not contain patterns that occur again. For this reason they cannot be compressed, and have a higher information value. 

Tawhid

Tawhid is the concept of God in Islam which says that only one God exists. It says that God is unique and one and He has no equal. It also says that since the God is the only creator, there is no room for lesser Gods or deities. Any lesser gods are therefore false. Tawhid is an essential part of Islam. To become a Muslim it is necessary to accept it. The concept of Tawhid has many implications. Since God is the only power, both good and bad flow from God. So, whatever good or bad occurs to an individual, both are from God and both should be accepted by the individual. Since God is the only power worth worshipping, reliance on any other source for help is not permissible.

The Qur'an explains the nature of God in Chapter 112:

Say: He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; None is born of Him, nor is He born; And there is no one like him.
Associating any other thing or person as being comparable to God is called "shirk" in Islam. This is the only sin in Islam which cannot be forgiven by God, unless a person turns repentant on Earth. The Koran can also be interpreted as telling Muslims to not follow the idea of the "trinity," the Christian concept for explaining God. Since the trinity views God as being made up of three different parts, many Muslims view this as believing in more than one god (shirk). On the other hand, Christians will say that they view the trinity as making up one God, so it is not believing in more than one god. The Koran also says that Jesus did not claim to be anything more than a human being, while in Christianity he is part of the trinity. According to Muslim scripture, Jesus claims to be prophet chosen by God, different from the divine status he has in Christianity.

Asperger syndrome

Asperger syndrome (often Asperger's syndrome) was a former type of autism spectrum disorder. The diagnosis was combined with autism in the DSM-5 and the ICD-11 and no longer exists. It has been replaced by autism spectrum disorder.

It affects the way in which a person understands, talks, and acts with other people. A person who has Asperger syndrome may not fit in well with other people and may be unable to act like everyone else in different social situations. Neurotypical (or NT) is a term that was coined in the autistic community as a label for those other people who are not on the autism spectrum. Asperger syndrome is thought to manifest as a developmental disorder, and is not considered a mental illness. Most adults with Asperger syndrome can learn how to make friends, do useful work, and live successful lives. People with it sometimes call themselves Aspies. 

People who have it will have to deal with it for the rest of their lives. However, they can try many solutions to help them and learn how to be able to reduce the impact on their life. One solution can be medication to restrict the different symptoms like aggression. The big problem with people affected by Asperger's is that they cannot understand emotions or how people think. Therapists attempt to help the person with that. They will do many activities like acting an emotion and letting the Asperger people guess what it is.

Asperger syndrome may be observed and diagnosed in early childhood. No one knows exactly what causes it, but it is thought to have a genetic cause. The part of the brain that controls a person's "social behavior" (understanding and communicating with other people) may grow or function differently in a person with Asperger syndrome. Another part of the brain that may be different is the part that controls some body movement such as balance. A person with this condition may walk or act in a clumsy way and have trouble doing body actions such as sports. They may also do physical actions repetitively, such as rocking, flapping their hands, or tapping their feet. The condition seems to run in families. Parents who have Asperger's syndrome often have children who have it or another kind of autism.

Asperger syndrome cannot be found by testing blood or looking at someone's body. A medical doctor needs to talk with the person and other people who know him or her well, to watch how the person moves and behaves, and to learn about the person's past. Sometimes a doctor believes by mistake that the person has schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, ADHD, or mental retardation instead. Tourette syndrome with "tics" (repetitive, uncontrolled actions like twitching, blinking, and coughing) sometimes comes with Asperger syndrome. Many people with Asperger syndrome also have ADHD and/or OCD. It has been estimated that beyond half of the people with the syndrome, also carry some other type of syndrome, disorder, disability, disease, or illness. The MSD Manual says "strong evidence supports a genetic component".

People who have Asperger syndrome have normal to high intelligence. As children, they may need special help at home and school to learn social behavior. The syndrome cannot be made better by taking medicine. People who have this condition are sometimes given medicine to help them with depression, which is often experienced by people with the syndrome.

People with Asperger syndrome can have a hard time fitting in with other people. This social awkwardness has been called "active but odd". Adults who have it usually learn enough "coping skills" to act in a way that seems normal, but often with a few differences. Most people with the syndrome can communicate clearly with friends and family. They may have more difficulty in communicating with new people. People who carry the syndrome can sometimes seem rude or uninterested during conversations, without meaning anything wrong. They may also get stressed or unsettled when things do not go their way.

Asperger's syndrome characteristics include:

Asperger syndrome is noticeable when the person acts differently in social situations. Their social disabilities can have different levels. Not all people with Asperger syndrome have the same level of it. This characteristic is not the only one. Someone who dislikes people in general does not necessarily have Asperger's. Other characteristics that can be identified is that people with Asperger's hate any changes in their routine. They also dislike having eye contact. Most of the time they will try to avoid it and look away. Usually, people with Asperger syndrome have less facial expression than anybody else. There are many characteristics, and if someone only has some of them then they likely don't have Asperger's. Commonly, people with the syndrome tend to hum or pronounce different sounds to themselves, which they have heard in their surroundings, such as a reporter's voice, a man on the radio, lyrics from songs, words, things they have read, or what people around them usually say. They may repeatedly mention these words or phrases again and again.

In the 1940s, a doctor named Hans Asperger studied some children who were different from most other children that he knew but were like each other. He called them "little professors" because he thought that they were interesting and wrote a book about them. Dr. Asperger thought his "little professors" had a different sort of personality.

In the 1980s Dr. Lorna Wing made up the name "Asperger syndrome" for people with high-functioning autism after research into Hans Asperger's work.

In 1994 Asperger syndrome was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).

In 2013 Asperger syndrome was removed from the DSM.

In 2019, Asperger's syndrome was removed from the ICD. The diagnosis is now autism spectrum disorder.

Asperger syndrome is much more common in males than females. Statistics say that three males are affected for every one female.

It is widely discussed how common the syndrome is, as there are figures that show very different numbers. But, it probably lies between 1 in every 250, all the way up to 1 in every 10,000. A 2003 review of epidemiological studies of children found autism rates ranging from 0.03 to 4.84 per 1,000, with the ratio of autism to Asperger syndrome ranging from 1.5:1 to 16:1.

Mini

The Mini is a small car made by the British Motor Corporation (BMC), British Leyland and Rover from 1959 to 2000. It used a transverse engine and front-wheel drive, where the turning power was put on the front wheels of the car rather than the back wheels. Its design saved a large amount of space. It allowed most of the car's size to be used for passengers and luggage. It had only two doors, but could seat up to four passengers. 1959

The design was very influential for car-making in the second half of the 20th century. In 1999, the Mini was voted the second most influential car of the 20th century, behind the Ford Model T. The original model is considered an icon of the 1960s in Britain.

The original Mini was designed for BMC by Alec Issigonis.

It was first released in August 1959. Rover ceased production in October 2000. It was marketed under the names Austin, Morris, Cooper, Wolseley, Riley, British Leyland and Rover.

In 2001, the Mini was relaunched by BMW as a premium small hatchback which quickly became popular thanks to its retro styling, fun driving experience, many customisation options and strong resale values. It received redesigns in late 2006 and late 2013.

Edgar Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian

Edgar Douglas Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian OM PRS 30 November 1889 - 8 August 1977) was an English doctor. He won the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Charles Scott Sherrington for the discoveries about the functions of neurons.

Hydrogen deuteride

Hydrogen deuteride is a diatomic molecule. It is composed of the two isotopes of hydrogen: H protium and H deuterium.

Bond albedo

The Bond albedo is the fraction of power in the total electromagnetic radiation hitting an astronomical body which is scattered back out into space. It considers all wavelengths at all phase angles. It is necessary for estimating how much energy a planet or other body absorbs.

Geographical pole

A geographical pole is either of two points on the surface of a rotating planet where the axis of rotation meets the surface of the planet. The north geographical pole of a body is 90 degrees north of the equator. The south geographical pole lies 90 degrees south of the equator.

Relative to Earth's surface, the geographic poles move by a few metres over periods of a few years. 

As cartography requires exact and unchanging coordinates, the average positions of the geographical poles are taken as fixed. These "cartographic poles" become the points where the body's great circles of longitude intersect.


Spheroid

A spheroid is a kind of ellipsoid. It is got by rotating an ellipse about one of its principal axes. This means it is an ellipsoid with two equal semi-diameters.

Spheres are spheroids. Spheroids that are not spheres are either oblate or prolate.

Most celestial objects are oblate spheroids. They usually spin, and as they spin, centrifugal force pulls them into that shape. Few natural objects are prolate spheroids.


Invariable plane

The invariable plane of a planetary system is the plane passing through its barycenter (center of mass). 

In the Solar System, about 98% of this effect is from the mass of the four gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). The invariable plane is within 0.5° of the orbital plane of Jupiter. It is the weighted average of all planetary orbital and rotational planes.

The invariable plane is got from the sum of angular momenta, and is perpendicular to the angular momentum vector of the planets. It is almost invariable (unchanging) over the entire system. 

The Sun forms a counterbalance to all of the planets, so it is near the barycenter when Jupiter is on one side and the other three jovian planets (gas giants) are opposite on the other side. The Sun moves 2.17 solar radii away from the barycenter when all jovian planets are in line on other side. 

The orbital angular momenta of the Sun and all non-jovian planets, moons, and minor solar system bodies, as well as the axial rotation momenta of all bodies, totals only about 2%.

For almost all purposes the plane can be considered invariable (unchanging) when working in Newtonian dynamics.

G-Force

The g-force of an object is its acceleration relative to free fall. On earth this is 1g, or 9.8 meters per second squared (m/s^2) or equivalently  newtons of force per kilogram of mass (N/kg). Astronauts experience unusually high and low g-forces. G-force can also be seen on rollercoasters. When the coaster goes down the drop, you are pushed back into your seat because of g-force. Negative g-forces is when gravity is pushing you downwards causing you to feel weightless. (Going down a rollercoaster) Positive g-forces is when gravity is pushing against you causing you to feel heavier. (Going up a rollercoaster) 

Sidereal time

Sidereal time is a time-keeping system. It is used by astronomers to find celestial objects. Using sidereal time it is possible to point a telescope to the proper coordinates in the night sky. 

Sidereal time is a "time scale based on Earth's rate of rotation measured relative to the fixed stars". 

Because the Earth moves in its orbit about the Sun, a mean solar day is about four minutes longer than a sidereal day. Thus, a star appears to rise four minutes earlier each night, compared to solar time. Different stars are visible at different times of the year.

By contrast, solar time is reckoned by the movement of the Earth from the perspective of the Sun. An average solar day (24 hours) is longer than a sidereal day (23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds) because of the amount the Earth moves each day in its orbit around the Sun.


Scale height

A scale height is a term for a distance over which a quantity decreases by a factor of "e" (the base of natural logarithms). The scale height is usually shown by a capital letter "H".

Jupiter impact

Several impacts have been seen on the face of Jupiter

In July 1994, a comet broke up into many pieces and then crashed into Jupiter over the course of many days. The comet was called Shoemaker-Levy 9. The largest pieces left scars on the face of Jupiter. Some of the scars were larger than the Earth.

A large impact was observed with the Keck II telescope and its near-infrared camera at Mauna Kea on July 20 11:20 UT. It occurred on the surface of Jupiter.

Ja zuster, nee zuster

Ja zuster, nee zuster (in English: Yes Nurse, No Nurse) was a very popular comedy series on Dutch television in the late 1960s. It was set in a home for old people. The Dutch title literally means, "Yes, Sister; No, Sister"; because in the Netherlands, as in Britain and many other countries, female nurses of a certain rank are called "Sister".

The series was broadcast between 1966 and 1968 and consisted of 20 episodes. 

The script was written by Annie M.G. Schmidt who was already very well known as a writer of books for children and scripts for television and radio programmes. The songs were written by Harry Bannink.

Dutch people today, especially those who remember the original series, are very disappointed that, apart from one programme, the whole series has been lost. This is because it was recorded on Ampex tape which was very expensive so, after the episodes had been shown on television, other television programmes were recorded on the same tape over the top of it. Some of the film that was shot outside has been preserved. 15 of the songs from the series have also been preserved. They were made into a gramophone record (LP) and later into a CD.

A film with the same title, based on the series, was produced in 2002. It starred Loes Luca as Zuster (Sister) Klivia and Paul Kooij as her landlord and nextdoor neighbour, Buurman Boordevol.

The stories in the television series are about a group of people who live in “Rusthuis Klivia”. The word “rusthuis” means “resthouse”. It is usually used in Dutch to describe an old people’s home (retirement home), although some of the actors in the programme were not really old. There was always chaos in the home. The characters were very strange. One of them grew spinach in the garden, one of them was an engineer who was always doing experiments in the cellar. One of them was a burglar. The neighbour tries to get everyone evicted (thrown out), but he never succeeds. 

Each episode had a guest actor who was often a well-known Dutch television personality.

There were many songs in the series. The most popular ones include "De kat van ome Willem" ("Uncle Williams’ Cat"), "Ja Zuster, Nee Zuster" ("Yes Nurse, No Nurse"), "Niet met de deuren slaan" ("Don’t bang the doors") and "M'n opa" ("My grandpa").

In 1999 a book was published with reconstructions of the stories. An exhibition was opened between November 2002 and March 2003 in Hoorn, North Holland. A musical is now being made which should be ready by 2009. It will be performed in many theatres throughout the Netherlands.

Stewart Cink

Stewart Ernest Cink (born May 21, 1973) is an American professional golfer. Cink won the 2009 Open Championship, beating five-time winner Tom Watson in a four-hole playoff. He spent 39 weeks in the top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings from 2004 to 2008.

Cink was born in Huntsville, Alabama and grew up in Florence, where he attended Bradshaw High School. He completed high school in 1991 and he attended Georgia Tech in Atlanta, where he played golf for the Yellow Jackets; he turned professional in 1995. After winning the Mexican Open and three events on the Nike Tour (now the Nationwide Tour) in 1996, Cink joined the PGA Tour in 1997 and won the Canon Greater Hartford Open in his rookie season. Cink performed consistently on the Tour over the next few years, picking up another win at the 2000 MCI Classic. Until his victory in the Open Championship in 2009, 2004 was his career year to date, with a fifth-place finish on the money list and wins at the MCI Heritage and at the WGC-NEC Invitational, which is one of the World Golf Championships events and was the most prestigious win of his career at the time. In 2009 he won his first career major with a playoff victory over 59-year old Tom Watson in The Open Championship.

On February 24, 2008, Cink was the runner-up in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship played in Marana, Arizona, falling 8 & 7 in the 36-hole final to top-ranked Tiger Woods. In June 2008, he reached his highest ever ranking, sixth, in the Official World Golf Rankings with his victory at the Travelers Championship in suburban Hartford.

ATP synthase

ATP synthase is an enzyme found in cells that makes ATP from ADP(adenosine di-phosphate) and inorganic phosphate. The ATP synthase is powered by the difference of concentration of pH between inside and outside the place where the enzyme is located. The exact mechanism in which it does so is unknown, although it is believed to work like a rotating machine. 

Bayreuth Festival

The Bayreuth Festival (German: Bayreuther Festspiele, Bavarian: "Bareida Festspui", East Franconian: "Baraida Fesdspil") is a music festival held every year in Bayreuth, Germany, at which performances of operas by the 19th century German composer Richard Wagner are performed. It was Wagner's own idea to start a festival for his operas in Bayreuth in a theatre which he designed himself because he was not satisfied with the way that theatres were usually designed.

The theatre that he designed is called the Festspielhaus (Festival House). Wagner watched the theatre being built, making sure that it was done the way he wanted it. He had some new ideas about theatre design. For example: he wanted the orchestra pit to be so low that the orchestra would not be seen by the audience.

When the theatre was opened in 1876 his cycle of operas called the "Der Ring des Nibelungen" was performed complete for the first time.

The festival immediately became internationally famous. Almost every serious musician in Europe wanted to go to Bayreuth to hear Wagner's music performed there. Composers usually either loved it and were strongly influenced by it, or they hated it and reacted against it.

The festival still continues now. Every August there is a festival of Wagner's operas. It is extremely difficult to get tickets because so many people want to go. People often wait for ten years before they can get a ticket.

Wagner wanted the festival to be in a small town where people could just concentrate on his music. Bayreuth already had a theatre, the Markgräfliches Opernhaus, but it was not suitable for modern opera. The town did not have a cultural life that would be in competition with Wagner's music. Another reason for choosing Bayreuth was that it was in an area where the rights to perform his operas were still under his control (he had sold these rights in other areas many years earlier in order to raise money).

King Ludwig II of Bavaria gave a lot of money to Wagner to built the new opera house. Wagner also made tours across Germany to get money for it. Societies were established to raise money.

The architect who designed the opera house was Gottfried Semper.

The opening took place on August 13, 1876, with a performance of Das Rheingold. A lot of important people were there, including Kaiser Wilhelm, Dom Pedro II of Brazil, King Ludwig (who came in secret, perhaps because he did not want to meet the Kaiser), and other members of the nobility, as well as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and the composers Anton Bruckner, Edvard Grieg, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, and Franz Liszt. Hans Richter was the conductor.

During Wagner's life the festival just performed the Ring Cycle and, later, his opera "Parsifal". After Wagner's death, his widow Cosima continued to run the festival. She gradually introduced the other operas Wagner had written, so that all ten operas were in the repertoire. The operas were always performed exactly as Wagner had done. Nothing was allowed to be changed in any way.

After Cosima retired from running the festival in 1906, Wagner's son Siegfried took over management of the festival. He did some things differently, introducing new staging and performance styles. When he died in 1930 the festival was run by his widow Winifred.

In the 1920s, some years before the rise of the Nazi party, Winifred Wagner became a close friend of Adolf Hitler. Because of this, Bayreuth was able to continue getting a lot of money during the Nazi period. Wagner's works were used by the Nazi as propaganda tools. It is strange that Hitler went to performances in Bayreuth that included Jewish and foreign singers, long after they had been banned from performing in all other places in Germany. Winifred's influence with Hitler was so strong that Hitler even wrote a letter to the anti-fascist Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini, begging him to lead the festival. Toscanini refused.

It was during this time that the festival made its first break from tradition. They stopped using the 19th century scenery on the stage. Many people disagreed with this, including Toscanini and Richard Strauss, and even some members of the Wagner family. They thought it should stay exactly like Wagner had known it.

During the war, the Nazi party ran the festival. Operas were performed for soldiers who had been hurt in the fighting. These soldiers were forced to go to lectures on Wagner before the performances, even if they were not interested in music.

A lot of Bayreuth was destroyed by bombing in the last days of World War II, though the theatre itself was undamaged. After the war, Winifred Wagner was sentenced to probation by a war court because she had supported the Nazi party. Ironically, it was because of Winifred that the theatre was not bombed. She had not allowed it to be used for military purposes, so it was not a military target. After the war the theatre was used for other kinds of concerts for the next few years. The festival started again in 1951, opening with a performance of Beethoven's Symphony no 9, followed by a performance of Wagner's opera, "Parsifal"

Wieland Wagner, the composer's grandson, had some very new ideas, including very abstract scenery. Some of the audience even booed. What Wieland was trying to do was to make a big break from the past with its association with Hitler. Wieland died in 1966. For a time people wondered whether the festival would continue. There were a lot of arguments within the Wagner family. Wieland's brother Wolfgang Wagner remained in charge of running the festival for the next 42 years, while the money was controlled by the Richard Wagner Foundation.

Wieland Wagner started a workshop in Bayreuth in which directors could meet and discuss new ideas for presenting the operas. This made it easier for new ideas to be accepted, and gave new life to the festival.

The centenary of the festival was celebrated in 1976 with a great production of the Ring directed by the French director Patrice Chereau. His production concentrated on showing how the Ring was about the 19th century working class being used by the wealthy capitalists. Some people thought it was the best opera performance they had ever seen, others hated it.

There has been a lot of uncertainty about what would happen after Wolfgang retired. Many people wanted the festival to continue to be in the hands of the Wagner family. On 1 September 2008, Wolfgang Wagner's daughters, Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina Wagner, were named by Bavaria's culture minister to take over the Festival. They have said that they want to "bring opera to the people". In 2009 Wagner's opera "Tristan und Isolde" will be live on the web. It will only cost £12.90 to watch online. People will also be able to watch it for free on a big screen in the centre of Bayreuth.


Repertoire

Repertoire (pronounce: "Re-per-twahr") is a French word used in music and in the theatre. It means a list of pieces of music or plays. Sometimes the English word repertory is used.

When a pianist speaks about his or her "repertoire", it means all the pieces that he can play. Most famous musicians have a wide repertoire (they can play a lot of pieces).

The "piano repertoire" means all music written for the piano. The violin has a much larger solo repertoire than the viola. That means that much more solo music has been written for the violin than for the viola.

A theatre company may have a "repertoire". That means all the plays that they regularly perform. Sometimes theatre companies are called "repertory theatres" because they have a particular list of plays that they perform.

Working class

Working class is a term used to describe people in society who have jobs which are not academic or highly paid. They're usually jobs which are physical, especially when they are paid an hourly wage.

Different societies will have different ideas about what "working class" is. People started talking about the working class after industrialization in the early 19th century. Karl Marx wrote about the working class.

Working class contrasts with middle class and upper class, which are above working class. The underclass is below the working class.


Ludwig II of Bavaria

Ludwig II (German: "Ludwig der Zweite von Bayern"; Ludwig Otto Friedrich Wilhelm; 25 August 1845 – 13 June 1886) was king of Bavaria from 1864 until shortly before his death (Bavaria is now part of Germany, but at that time it was a separate country). He is well known for his support for the composer Richard Wagner.

He is often referred to as the Mad King Ludwig because his behaviour was very odd. For example, he would leave his castle by climbing out of the window instead of walking out of the door. He is sometimes referred to as the Swan King in English and "der Märchenkönig" (the Fairy tale King) in German. This is because he built several very expensive and fancy castles, the most famous one being Neuschwanstein.

It is not clear whether his death by drowning was suicide or whether he was murdered.

Today tourists from all over the world visit the castles that he built. They also visit the Bayreuth Festspielhaus for which he gave a lot of money towards the building.

Ivan Regen

Ivan (Janez) Regen (called Johann Regen) (December 9, 1868 – July 27, 1947), was a Slovenian biologist. He is best known for his studies in bioacoustics, the science of hearing and communicating.

Regen was born in the village of Lajše (now Slovenia). His mother encouraged his interest in insect sounds. His father lost a lot of money bring cloth into Slovenia and could not pay for Ivan to go to school. Ivan was given a scholarship so that he could go to school at the local seminary. He was able to save enough money go to study in Vienna. He studied natural history at the University of Vienna with teachers Grobben, Exner and Claus. He got his doctorate in 1897 and began to work as a school teacher in Vienna, and later in Hranice, Moravia. Exner helped him get a job back in Vienna. He worked in a secondary school there until his retirement in 1918.

Regen began to study insects in great detail. He was one of the first Slovenian scientists to work in another country after World War I. He was the first scientist to study the grasshopper in a lot of detail. He studied katydid and cricket sounds, he proved that insects did react to sounds from each other. He was able to make crickets react to artificial sounds using a loudspeaker. In one experiment, he used a telephone to send sounds from one cricket to another in different rooms. Later, he showed that insects hear with their ear drum. He was the first person to work out what the ear drum does. He is the person who started the study of bioacoustics. He also studied the insects breathing, their hibernation, coloring, and how they shed their skin.

Regen's largest project was his "geobiological laboratory", a large glass cage, called a terrarium. He used this to study the way crickets could find other crickets using sounds; this is called phonotaxis. Using up to 1600 females with normal or damaged hearing, he was able to work out how they did this.

He worked for himself after 1911, but he supported several groups and organizations in Slovenia. He started using Slovene terminology in his areas of study. In 1921, he was asked to be a professor at the University of Ljubljana, but did not take it. In 1940, he became a member of Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts and was also a member of Slovenian Society of Natural History.

Even though he was a famous scientist known around the world, he was poor and lived alone. His experiments were paid for by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, but he was not allowed to be a member. He did all his work at home. After his death, a lot of his special equipment such as microphones, oscilloscopes, galvanometer, and his written notes were destroyed. 

Mole cricket

The mole crickets are the family Gryllotalpidae, of broad insects about 3–5 cm (1-2 inches) long, with large eyes and shovel-like forelimbs for burrowing and swimming.

Mole crickets are omnivores or meat eaters, feeding on larvae, worms, roots, and grasses. Common predators of mole crickets include birds, rats, skunks, armadillos, raccoons and foxes.

Hisashi Tsuchida

Tsuchida was born in Okayama on February 1, 1967. After graduating from Osaka University of Economics, he joined Japan Soccer League club Mitsubishi Motors (later "Urawa Reds") in 1989. He played many matches as goalkeeper from 1991. In 1992, Japan Soccer League was folded and founded new league J1 League. He battles with Yuki Takita for the position for a long time. He played as regular goalkeeper in 1994 and 1995. However he lost regular position for injury in 1996, and his opportunity to play decreased from 1997. He could not play at all in the matches from 1999. He retired with rival Takita end of 2000 season.

In 1988, when Tsuchida was an Osaka University of Economics student, he was selected Japan national "B team" for 1988 Asian Cup. At this competition, he played one game. However, Japan Football Association don't count as Japan national team match because this Japan team was "B team" not "top team".

Gun dog

Gun dogs or gundogs, also called bird dogs, are types of dogs used to help hunters find and retrieve game (the animals the hunters are hunting), usually birds. 

Gundogs are divided into three primary types: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. Flushing dogs flush game from hiding. Pointer dogs point their muzzle towards game to allow the hunter to locate the animal. Retrievers retrieve game once it is killed. Some kennel clubs define a Gundog Group for gundogs, while other kennel clubs include them in the Sporting Group. The three most popular types are: Spaniel, Golden Retriever and Labrador.


Alaskan Klee Kai

The Alaskan Klee Kai is a northern breed of dog of the spitz type. The term "Klee Kai" was derived from Alaskan Athabaskan (Eskimo) words meaning "small dog". The breed was developed to create a pet sized version of the Alaskan Husky, but it more closely resembles the Siberian Husky. This result makes it an energetic, intelligent, apartment-sized dog with an appearance that reflects its northern heritage.

These dogs can come in a variety of different coat colors: black and white, gray and white, red and white and all white. They have a double coat, which means it is thicker.

In 1997, the United Kennel Club recognized the Alaskan Klee Kai. It is a rare breed with not very many dogs.


Alaskan Malamute

The Alaskan Malamute is a breed of domestic dog. It was originally bred for use as an Alaskan sled dog. This dog is usually large in size. It is sometimes mistaken for a Siberian Husky. The Alaskan Malamute is strong and powerful and was used to carry heavy loads for long distances. 

This dog is the largest and oldest of the Arctic sled dogs. Malamutes can be family pets, but are very active. They enjoy sledding, running and swimming with their owners. Their coat is thick and comes in colors from light gray to black or from sable to red. They have a plumed tail. 

Aidi

The Aidi or Chien de l'Atlas is a Moroccan dog breed used to protect flocks of sheep and goats. It also can hunt and smell very well.. In its native Morocco it is often paired in hunting with the Sloughi, which chases down prey that the Aidi has found by sniffing it out.


Airedale Terrier

The Airedale Terrier (often shortened to "Airedale") is a breed of the terrier type, that first came from Airedale, a geographic area in Yorkshire, England. 

It traditionally was called the "King of Terriers" because before the creation of the Black Russian Terrier, the Airedale was largest of the terrier breeds. The breed has also been called the Waterside Terrier, because it was bred to hunt otters in and around the valleys of the River Aire in Airedale. In England this breed has also been used as a police dog.

Xinjiang

Xinjiang (also transliterated as Sinkiang) is a northwestern region of the People's Republic of China. Like all of China, it is also claimed by the Republic of China. It is a large area with few people. It is over 1.6 million km, which takes up about one sixth of the country's land. It is mainly inhabited by Uyghurs who are Turkic people.

In the 19th century, when the name of the Silk Road was first used by a German geographer, it just included the land route from Xinjiang to Central Asia. Xinjiang sits at the heart of the Silk Road in China. At that time, the country was often called "Chinese Turkestan" for its many Turkic peoples.

Xinjiang borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and Jammu and Kashmir's Leh District to the south and Qinghai and Gansu provinces to the southeast, Mongolia to the east, Russia to the north and Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan to the west, Pakistan and Kashmir region to the southwest.

Ürümqi is the capital of Xinjiang and the largest city in Western China. It also holds the world record for being the most remote city from any sea in the world; it is 2,500 km from any coastline.

The east-west chain of the Tian Shan Mountains separate Dzungaria in the north from the Tarim Basin in the south. Dzungaria is dry steppe. The Tarim Basin is desert surrounded by oases. In the east is the Turpan Depression. The Taklamakan Desert is also in Xinjiang. Ürümqi, the capital, Turpan, Kashgar, Karamay, Yining and Shihezi are the major cities.

Ancyloxypha numitor

The least skipper ("Ancyloxypha numitor") is a butterfly in the family Hesperiidae. It is native to North America. They have a weak, bouncy flight.

The least skipper can be found in damp or wet habitats with tall grasses. In the northern part of the its range, adults may be seen from May to September. In the southern part of its range, adults can be found from February to December. It may be seen all year in southern Florida.

The least skipper has rounded wings and a skinny body. Their antennae are checkered and have no hooks. Male least skipper do not have stigmata. The upper side of the top wing is dark brown, sometimes having orange on it. The bottom wing is orange with a dark brown border around it. The underside of the wings is bright orange. The bottom wing's veins are a whitish color. Its wingspan (length of the wings) is ¾ to 1 inch.

Males find females by looking for them in tall grasses. Females lay their eggs one at a time on the caterpillar's host plant (the plant that the caterpillar feeds on). The eggs are pale yellow. The caterpillar makes a nest of grass and silk. The caterpillar is green. It has four pairs of white wax glands on the abdomen near the underside. The head is brown or tan. It is usually darker in the center. The collar (the area between where the head and the body connect) has a white stripe and a black stripe. The chrysalis is a cream color and has brown markings. The caterpillar will hibernate in the winter. The least skipper has 2-4 broods each year.

Here is a list of host plants that the least skipper caterpillar feeds on:


There are some species of butterflies that are similar to the least skipper. They are the European skipper ("Thymelicus lineola"), the tropical least skipper ("Ancyloxypha arene"), the orange skipperling ("Copaeodes aurantiaeca"), and the southern skipperling ("Copaeodes minima").

Wakhan

Wakhan or "the Wakhan" (also spelt Vakhan; Persian and واخان, is a region of Afghanistan. It is part of the Pamir Mountains and the Karakoram Range. Not very many people live there.

Factor VIII

Factor VIII (FVIII) is a blood clotting factor that is also called anti-hemophilic factor (AHF). In humans, Factor VII is in the F8 gene. If there is something wrong with this gene, you get hemophilia A, which is a recessive disorder. The gene for Factor VIII is on the X chromosome.

X chromosome

The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes in mammals. They decide the sex (gender) of an individual. The other sex chromosome is the Y chromosome.

Females have two X chromosomes, males have one X and one Y. An egg always carries a single X, while sperms carry either an X or a Y. That is how sex is determined in humans, and in most other mammals. Although females have two X chromosomes, each cell can only have one X chromosome active. During early development, a process called X-inactivation occurs. In each cell one of the X chromosomes randomly deactivates. This causes different parts of the body to have different X-linked genes, and is responsible for the black and orange coloration of calico cats.


Chance

Chance is a word that refers to:


1987 Edmonton tornado

The Edmonton tornado was a powerful and devastating tornado that hit the eastern part of Edmonton, Alberta on the afternoon of July 31, 1987. It destroyed more than 300 homes. It was rated as a strong F4 to a weak F5 tornado on the Fujita scale. It cost $332.27 million in total damage. It killed 27 people and injured more than 300 people and was the second deadliest tornado in Canadian history.

Vale of White Horse

The Vale of White Horse is a local government district of Oxfordshire in England. The main town is Abingdon, other places are Faringdon and Wantage. There are 68 parishes within the district.

It is a region between the Berkshire Downs and the River Thames. It was named after the prehistoric Uffington White Horse. The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. The area is often referred to as the ‘Vale of the White Horse’.

It is the valley of the Ock, a stream which joins the Thames from the West at Abingdon. The Vale is almost flat and well-wooded. Following local usage the vale covers all the ground between the Cotswolds (on the north) and the White Horse Hills. According to the geographical definition, however, the Vale is from two to five miles wide, and the distance by road from Abingdon to Shrivenham at its head is 18 miles.

The highest hill of the district is White Horse Hill that is 261 m (856 ft) high. In its northern flank, just below the summit, a gigantic figure of a horse is cut, the turf is removed to show the white chalky soil beneath. This figure gives name to the hill, the range and the vale. It is 114 m (374 ft) long, the neck, body and tail varying little in width.


Slipper

A slipper is a light shoe worn indoors. They keep feet warm. People also wear them to keep their feet or socks clean. They are usually made of a something comfortable like a towel material or thin leather. They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. 
The recorded history of slippers can be traced back to the 12th century. In the West, the record can only be traced to 1478.
Slippers in China date from 4700 BCE. They were made of cotton or woven rush, had leather linings, and featured symbols of power, such as dragons.

Native American moccasins were also highly decorative. Such moccasins showed nature scenes and were decorated with beadwork and fringing, their soft sure-footedness made them good for indoors taking (or setting aside). Inuit and Aleut people made shoes from smoked hare-hide to protect their feet against the frozen ground inside their homes.

Beautiful Orientalism saw the introduction into the West of designs like the baboosh.

Victorian people needed such shoes to keep the dust and gravel outside their homes. For Victorian ladies, slippers gave an opportunity to show off their needlepoint skills and use embroidery as decoration.
Types of slippers include:
Some slippers are made to look like something other than a slipper and are sold as a novelty item. The slippers are usually made from soft and colorful materials and may come in the shapes of animals, animal paws, vehicles, cartoon characters, etc.

Not all shoes with a soft fluffy interior are slippers. Any shoe with a rubber only and laces is a normal outdoor shoe. In India, rubber chappals (flip-flops) are worn as indoor shoes.

The province was separated from the neighbouring Luxembourg by the Third Partition of Luxembourg in 1839, after the Belgian Revolution, and declared to remain a part of Belgium.

During World War I, Luxembourg was occupied by the German Empire.

The Battle of the Bulge, a German counter-attack against the Allied offensive in the Ardennes in the winter of 1944/45, took also place in the province of Luxembourg.

Most of the residents of Luxembourg speak French, but there is a small Luxembourgish-speaking minority, in Arelerland (the eastern part of Belgian Lorraine: Arlon and surroundings), near the border with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in the southeast.

The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with double-decker and articulated buses carrying larger loads, and midibuses and minibuses carrying smaller loads. Coaches are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, are free. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving licence.

Buses are an important part of public transport in places all over the world. Many people who do not have cars, especially the third world countries, use buses to get around. Buses make it easy for them to get to where they want to go.

Buses can have many types of bus. For example : The double decker bus.

A place where people wait for a local bus is called a "bus stop". A building where people wait for a long-distance bus or where many buses meet is called a "bus station".

Life vest

A life vest (also called Personal flotation device, lifejacket, or cork jacket) is a special type of clothing. The vest makes people float in water. It also keeps their head out of the water so that they can breathe. There are different categories of life vests. They are mainly different in how much flotation they provide. Some life vests inflate all by themselves, others need to be filled with air manually.

A life vest has one very important property: The part of keeping the head outside the water works even if the persion is unconscious, or unable to do anything. A swimming aid will simply help the person in the water, and make swimming easier. It will not work on its own.

People doing watersports, for example sailing, usually wear life vests.

There are two broad categories of life vests: 


Life vests are also classified by the minimum and maximum supported weight, which is usually printed on the vest. For this reason, there are special life vests for children. Also note, that the simplest types of life vest usually do not support the person wearing it becoming unconscious (and still guarantee that the person is in the right position, and the head is outside the water). 

To be safe even for unconscious people, these vests must bring the wearers to lie on their back. For adults, this means that they must have a flotation of at least 230 Newton. Note that even with such vests, this can usually not be guaranteed: The wrong angle of hiting the water surface, or the position of arms and legs can prevent it. 

Pocket watch

A pocket watch is a timepiece that is kept in the pocket rather than worn on a wrist (wristwatch). It is thought to be invented by Peter Henlein.

The pocket watch usually has a chain to connect to a certain clothing, so the watch would not fall out of the pocket and get broken. This watch was popular before the wristwatch become popular. Because of wristwatches, the pocket watch became less common and popular. Still, some people today wear pocket watches, and a golden pocket watch is often a token of a person's retirement.

Ouanaminthe

Ouanaminthe (Kréyòl: "Wanament") is a city in northeast Haiti. It is the most important city of the Nord-Est "Département". In Spanish, the city is called sometimes "Juana Méndez".

The city is part of an "arrondissement" (a part of a department) with the same name, along the northern border with the Dominican Republic. The Dajabón River is between Ouanaminthe and the Dominican city of Dajabón. The border crossing to Dajabón is one of the four chief land crossings from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and Haitians living in Ouanaminthe are allowed to cross the border to Dajabón only two days per week.


Developing country

Different people have tried to classify countries into different groups. This is usually done either by looking at how rich people are, on average, in different countries. Most of the time there are two groups, namely developing countries and developed ones. Sometimes there are three groups, in which case the third group is between developing and developed countries, and is usually called emerging countries.

These definitions are problematic, because a high standard of living does not just mean that people make a lot of money. The main problem is that things cost different amounts in different countries. Just because people earn more money in one country does not necessarily mean they are better-off; they might earn more simply because the cost of living is higher. This means they need to spend more money just to buy those things they need every day.

For this reason, there are different definitions of developing countries. The level of economic development also changes a lot from one developing countries to another. There are developing countries that have a high standard of living.

Many of these countries have a lot of natural resources but not the Industrialization that would use them, so the resources are sold to the countries which can use them.

There have been many other names used to describe these countries, including:


Malden Island

Malden Island is an island in the Pacific Ocean. Today, the island belongs to Kiribati. It is one of the Line Islands. In the 19th century the island used to be called Independence Island at times. The island is uninhabited today, it has been made into a nature reserve for breeding seabirds.

Malden Island is located 242 nautical miles (nmi) south of the equator, 150 nmi south of Honolulu, Hawaii. The coast of South America is more than 4,000 nautical miles (5,000 statute miles or 8,000 km) to the east.

The nearest land is uninhabited Starbuck Island, 110 nmi to the southwest. The closest inhabited place is Tongareva (Penrhyn Island),243 nmi to the southwest. The nearest airport is on Kiritimati (Christmas Island), 365 nmi to the northwest. There are other uninhabited islands nearby. They include Jarvis Island, 373 nmi to the northwest, Vostok Island, 385 nmi to the south-southeast, and Caroline (Millennium) Island, 460 nmi to the southeast.

The island has roughly the shape of an equilateral triangle, with on a side, aligned with the southwest side running northwest to southeast. The west and south corners are slightly truncated, shortening the north, east and southwest coasts to about , and adding shorter west and south coasts about 1 to 2 km (–1 mi) in length. 

There is a large lagoon with many small islets in the east-central part of the island. The lagoon is completely sourrounded by land. It is connected to the sea by underground channels, and is quite salty. Most of the land area of the island lies to the south and west of the lagoon. The total area of the island is about 39.2 square kilometers. 

The island is very low, no more than above sea level at its highest point. The highest elevations are found along a rim that closely follows the coastline. The inside forms a depression that is only a few meters above sea level in the western part and is below sea level (filled by the lagoon) in the east central part. Because of this topography, the ocean cannot be seen from much of Malden's interior.

There is no standing fresh water on Malden Island, though a fresh water lens may exist.

A continuous heavy surf falls all along the coast, forming a narrow white to gray sandy beach. On the west coast, the white sandy beach is bigger. On the rest of the coast there is a strip of dark gray coral rubble, forming a ridge. This makes the beach itself smaller.

George Anson Byron, a British captain, discovered Malden Island on 30 July 1824. He named it after Charles Robert Malden who was the first to land on the island. At the time of its discovery, the island was uninhabited, but there were ruins. Archeologists discovered that the island was inhabited by between 100 and 200 Polynesians, a few centuries earlier. 

The ancient stone structures are located around the beach ridges. Most of them are on the north and south sides. Overall, twenty-one sites are known. Three of them are larger than the others. They can be found on the northwest side of the island. The sites are either temples, houses or graves. The temple ruins are referred to as marae. Similar marae have also been found on other islands, such as Raivavae, one of the Austral Islands.

The inhabitants had also made wells, but later settlers found them to be dry, or too salty.

In 1828, guano was discovered on the island. In 1856, the United States wanted to get the Island, but Australian firms had already started to mine the guano deposits. Guano mining stopped about 1927. In 1956 and 1957, Great Britain tested H-bombs on the island. The tests were called Operation Grapple.

York Minster

York Minster is the largest Gothic cathedral in Northern Europe. The title "Minster" is given to churches which in the Anglo-Saxon period were missionary teaching churches. 

York Minster is in the city of York, North Yorkshire, England. It is the 'seat' of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest-ranking bishop in the Church of England. The Minster is run by a Chapter (committee) under the Dean of York, who manages the affairs of the Minster. The current archbishop (since 2005) is Dr. John Sentamu. 

The architecture of the Minster is English Gothic architecture, from Early English in 1270 to Perpendicular in 1472. The Minster has a wide, Decorated Gothic nave (where the congregation sits) and Chapter house. The choir (spelled 'quire' by the church) is slightly later English Gothic architecture. The east end, and north and south transepts are in a similar style. The nave contains the West Window, constructed in 1338. 

Some of the stained glass in York Minster dates back to the twelfth century. Over the Lady Chapel in the east end is the Great East Window (finished in 1408), one of the largest areas of mediaeval stained glass in the world. The window is known to be the work of John Thornton of Coventry a master glazier and stained glass artist who was active in England during the first half of the 15th century. 

In the north transept is the Five Sisters Window, each narrow window being over high. The south transept contains the famous Rose window. About 2 million individual pieces of glass make up the cathedral's 128 stained glass windows. Much of the glass was removed before and pieced back together after the First and Second World Wars, and the windows are constantly being cleaned and restored to keep their beauty intact.

A total of seven clock bells, 14 change ringing bells and 22 carillon bells are lodged in the towers. The carillon bells are played on a baton keyboard in the ringing chamber. The largest bell is Great Peter, which strikes the hour. It weighs 10.8 tons.

York has had a Christian presence from the 300s. The first church on the site was a wooden structure built hurriedly in 627 to provide a place to baptise Edwin, King of Northumbria. A stone building was completed in 637, and was dedicated to Saint Peter. Its school and library were started in the 7th century.

In 741 the church was destroyed in a fire. It was rebuilt as a bigger building, with thirty altars. The church and the entire area then passed through the hands of Norse invaders. The Benedictine archbishop Ealdred travelled to Westminster to crown William in 1066. Ealdred died in 1069 and was buried in the church.

The church was damaged in 1069, but the first Norman archbishop, arriving in 1070, organised repairs. The Danes destroyed the church in 1075, but it was again rebuilt from 1080. Built in the Norman style, it was 111 m (364.173 ft) long. The new structure was damaged by fire in 1137 but was soon repaired. The choir and crypt were remodelled in 1154, and a new chapel was built, all in the Norman style.

The Gothic style in cathedrals had arrived in the mid 12th century. Walter de Gray was made archbishop in 1215 and ordered the construction of a Gothic structure to compare with Canterbury; building began in 1220. The cathedral was declared complete and consecrated in 1472.

The English Reformation led to the first Anglican archbishop. Some of the cathedral's treasures were taken by the Crown, and the church lost some of its land. Under Elizabeth I there was an effort to remove all traces of the Roman Catholic Church from the cathedral; there was much destruction of tombs, windows, and altars. In the English Civil War the city was besieged and fell to the forces of Cromwell in 1644, but Thomas Fairfax prevented any further damage to the cathedral.

Yıldız has sometimes spoken hatefully of Jews and of Israel on social media.

After the 2006 Israeli airstrike on Lebanon, live on television Tilbe said, "May God bring down one disaster after another upon Israel," to which the studio audience answered, “Amen.”

After the Israeli airstrikes on Gaza in early July 2014, Tilbe is said on social media site Twitter: "God bless Hitler, it was even too few what he did to the Jews, he was right" and "The Jews will be destroyed by Muslims, in the name of Allah, not much time left for it to be done".

Tilbe's tweets were supported from the mayor of Turkey's capital Ankara, Melih Gökçek, who is a member of the ruling Justice and Development Party, and also a controversial person. Later she tweeted that did not mean to praise Hitler and that she also has some Jewish friends.

Helicopter carrier

A Helicopter carrier is a type of aircraft carrier. A helicopter carrier carries helicopters and sometimes airplanes as well. Many countries have helicopter carriers because they are cheaper than aircraft carriers.

Panzerfaust

A Panzerfaust is a recoilless rifle that was invented by Germany. A Panzerfaust can only be used once unlike the Panzerschreck or the Bazooka. The Panzerfaust was used heavily late in World War II, especially during the Battle of Berlin. They were made in very large numbers. They were less powerful than later Rocket-propelled grenades. 

Ambush

An ambush, or a surprise attack, is a long-established military tactic. It is a surprise attack from a hidden position against an enemy. The enemy may be moving or have stopped. An ambush uses the element of surprise to confuse the enemy soldiers long enough to be successful. 

Unlike other surprise attacks, the point of an ambush is not to gain territory. Instead, it may be used to harass an enemy. It may also be used to or key assets (people, equipment, supplies, etc.).

One of the earliest recorded use of the ambush was in 9 AD in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. The Germanic leader Arminius ambushed three Roman legions thaï were under the command of Varus. The 20,000 Roman soldiers were strung out in a long line of march through the densely-wooded forest. The Romans fought for days but in the end were completely destroyed.

The Germanics had not only a military victory but also a psychological victory over the Romans.


Grapeshot

Grape shot is a canvas bag packed with small metal balls ("grapes"). This is protected from the gunpowder charge by metal wadding. As the name suggests, the balls fly through the air in a cluster, shot by a gun or a cannon. Grapeshot was much used until it became obsolete during the 19th century. These days it would be called an "antipersonnel weapon".

An artillery shell is a hollow ball packed with explosive and a fuse. The fuse is lit by the explosive charge that sends the shell towards its target. It is designed to explode when it reaches its target. Grape shot does not wait. It begins to spread as soon as it leaves the gun or cannon. Grape shot is quite different from a shell or shrapnel rounds.

Shrapnel, while similar to both, is different and more deadly. Invented by a British officer during the Napoleonic Wars, it is a fused explosive shell filled with many small balls or iron/lead bits. When the shell bursts the small bits scatter in a more or less spherical pattern with usually fatal force. 

All three of these rounds, grape shot, shell, and shrapnel, are extremely effective against troops, horses and other livestock. They can also destroy wooden structures. Shells have historically been effective as incendiaries against wooden targets, which they ignite from the heat of their explosive blast. Grape shot sends out mini-missiles across a wide pattern. This is best for human targets, but it may be damaging against nearby wooden structures.

Banzai charge

A Banzai charge (or ""banzai" attack") (萬歳突撃) was a tactic used by Japanese soldiers against the American soldiers when they were losing World War II. Banzai charges were usually suicide charges. This was so they would have an honourable death without surrender. Also, the charges were a final attempt to gain success against the Allied forces, which usually had more troops.

Paratrooper

Paratroopers are soldiers trained in parachuting and generally operate as part of an airborne force. Using paratroopers is called "paradrop operations".

The idea of dropping soldiers from height dates back to Benjamin Franklin whose idea was to drop soldiers with parachutes from balloons. The idea was not very practical, but the development of aeroplanes in World War I meant that it was feasible (that is: a working idea) to drop soldiers with parachutes from air.

Italy was the first country which founded airborne forces in the 1930s. Germany and Soviet Union soon followed. Germany was the first country to use paratroopers, called "Fallschirmjäger" (German language for "parachute ranger") in combat in World War Two. Germany dropped paratroops in Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Norway in 1940. United Kingdom founded its own airborne forces in 1941. The first British paradrop operation was a guerrilla strike against an important water line in Italy. In 1941, the Germans launched a massive paradrop operation in Crete, capturing the island from the British. The British troops had fought back so bitterly and caused so heavy casualties (that is: dead and wounded) to the German paratroopers that Adolf Hitler forbade any further paradrop operations.

When United States joined the war, it founded its own airborne forces. Americans made paradrops in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, France and Germany itself. The first really large paradrop operation was the Normandy invasion, called "Operation Overlord" 6.6. 1944 where the British dropped one and Americans dropped two divisions of paratroopers in Normandy, France to capture important bridges and traffic junctions.

The largest paradrop operation ever was Operation Market Garden in September 1944, which led into liberation of Belgium and capture of important ports at Rhine mouth. The last paradrop operation in World War Two was Operation Varsity, which was used to secure the bridgeheads at River Rhine and to open roads to Germany itself.

The development of helicopter meant that troops could now be carried and landed quickly on the spot and there was no more need for large scale paradrop operations. The last large paradrop has been during the Suez Crisis 1951 when the British dropped a battalion of paratroops at Suez.

Paratroops are elite troops in all armies around the world. They work as light infantry, and receive an extremely hard and good training. They are taught to run, fight, carry weapons, move and survive in very difficult terrain and conditions. All paratroopers are always volunteers. To become a paratrooper, a soldier must be very fit, very intelligent, have a very good discipline and have enough courage to jump off an aeroplane.

Paratroopers are mainly used as rangers in modern warfare. A ranger is a soldier who is employed very far from home base, often behind enemy lines. Their main task is to capture important bridges, buildings, villages and other sites, do guerrilla strikes like blowing up an enemy railway line, capture enemy leaders and important soldiers and do long range reconnaissance (that is: scouting and gathering information of enemy troops, movements etc).

Many paratrooper units have their own names, such as British "Red Devils", American "Screaming Eagles" and "All American" and German "Green Devils".

Paratroopers are dropped off at a place where they are meant to operate. This is called a "drop zone" (DZ). Paratroopers usually jump from heights of 100 to 400 m. They usually use round "bell" parachutes and they use static line deployment. (See the article Parachute on how the static line works.) They usually carry pistols and rifles with them, and their other weapons and gear are dropped on containers at the same time.

Once the paratroopers have landed, they take off their parachute rigs and gather to designated places. Their leaders then assign them orders. For example they may capture a bridge so their troops can use it, or destroy it with explosives so the enemy cannot use it. 

Paratroopers usually fight as light infantry. They usually have few heavy weapons, and no tanks or heavy artillery. Once the paratroopers have carried out their mission, they usually wait for their ground troops to arrive and take control. They may continue to fight on the ground, or may return to base and prepare for the next drop.

Paratroopers are currently not used, due to advancement in AA (anti-aircraft) guns. While paratroopers aren't used, paratroopers are still hired and trained.

Pikachu

Pikachu is a yellow mouse Pokémon from the fictional Pokémon world that was created by Satoshi Tajiri. Pikachu is the mascot of the Pokémon franchise, and one of the main characters of the Pokémon anime series. It has also appeared in most Pokémon video games and merchandise. In the video game "Pokémon Yellow", it is the player's starter Pokémon. In the anime series, Pikachu is Ash's first Pokémon.

Pikachu is an electric-type Pokémon, which attacks using electricity from two red pouches on its cheeks.

Pikachu evolves from a baby Pokémon called Pichu if it loves its trainer. Pikachu can evolve into Raichu, which is darker orange than Pikachu, if a Pikachu evolves in Alola the Raichu it evolves into has the ability to fly and use its tail kind of like a hoverboard.

Pikachu is a yellow mouse Pokémon. It has long ears with black tips. It has red cheeks that store electricity. It has brown stripes on its back. Pikachu has a lightning bolt-shaped tail, while female Pikachus have a heart-shape at the end of their tails.

Pikachu is 40 centimeters (1 foot, 4 inches) tall and it weighs 6 kilograms (14 pounds).

The name "Pikachu" comes from the Japanese words "pikapika" (the sound of electricity) and "chuchu" (the sound that a mouse makes).

In the "Pokémon" anime, the trainer Ash Ketchum's first Pokémon is a Pikachu. At first, it does not like him, but then he saves it from a group of Spearow and their friendship grows slowly from there.

Pikachu has also appeared in the "Super Smash Bros." series. He has appeared in "Super Smash Bros.", "Super Smash Bros. Melee", "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", "Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U", and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a very fast and light playable character. In the game Pokémon Go, Pikachu can be found wearing a Santa hat at Christmas.

Ryan Reynolds voiced Pikachu in the 2019 movie "".

Pichu is the pre-evolved form of Pikachu. It is a small yellow electric mouse, but is not as powerful as Pikachu. It evolves to Pikachu when it is very happy, such as loving its trainer. There are special forms of Pichu: a notched-ear Pichu, and a Pikachu-colored Pichu as event Pokémon in the "Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver" games. Pichu has appeared as an unlockable character in "Super Smash Bros. Melee" and "Super Smash Bros. Ultimate" where it has a cloned moveset to Pikachu's but takes damage when it uses electric attacks. Pichu features in the intro of the third Pokémon movie.

In the anime episode "Enter Pikachu", Ash's Pikachu was born as a Pichu and was raised by Kangaskhan (a Pokémon that looks like a kangaroo). After he became too big for Kangaskhan to raise, Pichu ran away and evolved into Pikachu.

Raichu is the evolved form of Pikachu and has orange fur, unlike Pikachu's yellow fur. In order for a Pikachu to evolve into a Raichu, it must use a Thunderstone. It can hold much more electricity in its cheeks. In Alola, it can evolve into Alolan Raichu by using a Thunderstone in Alola. It is a Psychic/Electric type. In the Pokémon anime, in Kanto, Gym Leader Lt. Surge's Raichu has a battle with Ash's Pikachu. At first, Raichu wins, but Pikachu beats it in a rematch.

Cypress Gardens

Cypress Gardens is a theme park near Winter Haven, Florida in the United States.

Cypress Gardens opened on January 2, 1936 as a flower garden planted by Dick and Julie Pope. Over the years, it became one of the biggest attractions in Florida, known for its water ski shows, nice gardens, and Southern Belle models.

It became known as the "Water Ski Capital of the World" because many of the sport's major "firsts" and over 50 world records were broken there. Many movies have been filmed at the park, including parts of "This is Cinerama," the first feature filmed in that wide-screen format, and several of Esther Williams films and TV specials in the 1950s and 1960s. With their addition of a custom photography boat named Miss Cover Girl in the early 1960s, the park became a popular site for the filming of television commercials.

Competition for guests increased after the Walt Disney World Resort opened nearby in 1971. In the early 1980s, the Popes retired and gave the park to their son, Dick Pope Jr.

In the 1980s, book publisher Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich bought the park along with SeaWorld, Circus World (later rebuilt as Boardwalk & Baseball) and Stars Hall of Fame, but sold most of the businesses to Anheuser-Busch in 1989. Busch continued to run Cypress Gardens until April 1, 1995, when a group of the park's managers led by Bill Reynolds bought the property.

Under President and CEO Reynolds, the park ran until April 13, 2003, when it closed after a long tourism decline following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. 529 people were put out of work with only three days notice. 

Right away the Friends of Cypress Gardens, started and led by Burma Davis Posey, was founded. They enrolled members in all 50 states and 27 countries. Within three and a half months, this grass-roots effort raised $13,500,000 and saved the park.

On February 22, 2004, Adventure Parks Group, owned by Kent Buescher, bought the property and renamed it Cypress Gardens Adventure Park. The purchase of the amusement park portion of the Cypress Gardens property was part of a larger conservation agreement. In that agreement, the entire site was bought from its previous owner, First Gardens, L.C., by The Trust for Public Land, a nation wide conservation group . TPL then sold a conservation access over the entire property to the state of Florida, while Polk County purchased the gardens portion of the property, less the development rights conveyed in the state agreement. Adventure Parks Group purchased the balance of the property, also subject to the conservation agreement.

Buescher's plan to reopen the park in September 2004 was delayed by damages created by hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne. Cypress Gardens Adventure Park finally opened in November 2004. One of its new rides, the Triple Hurricane roller coaster, was named for the fierce storm season. The Splash Island water park opened in 2005, along with the Galaxy Spin roller coaster.

In September 2006, Adventure Parks Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the Florida site following approximately $30 million in damages sustained by the 2004 hurricanes.

Land South Adventures, a branch of Mulberry, Florida-based Land South Holdings, bought Cypress Gardens at a bankruptcy auction on October 16, 2007 for $16.9 million, leaving Buescher as temporary manager until Baker Leisure Group of Orlando, Florida took over running the park in January 2008.

Many celebrities have skied and visited at the park, including Elvis Presley, Jordan's former King Hussein and his son, King Abdullah II. It was also the site of a Johnny Carson special.

On Monday, November 10, 2008, Land South Holdings announced the temporary closure of the park, which was shut down November 17 of that year. It reopened on March 28, 2009 with an expanded water park, named Splash Island. The rides and animals, however, were gone. The reopening prices were reduced. Cypress Gardens and Splash Island now have separate ticketing, though seasonal passes are available. Parking is now free.

Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion

The Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion is a musical composition by the Hungarian composer Béla Bartók. It was written for a very unusual combination of players. Four players are needed to perform this sonata: two pianists and two percussion players. The two pianists each have a piano, and the two percussion players play seven instruments between them: three timpani, xylophone, one side drum with snares and one without, a suspended cymbal, a pair of cymbals, a bass drum, a triangle and a tam-tam.

In the introduction to the score Bartók gave very precise instructions about how the different percussion instruments should be played, the kinds of beaters to be used, and a plan of how they were to be grouped on stage.

There are three movements: a fast movement, a slow movement and a fast movement. The first movement starts with a slow introduction.

There are many interesting and unusual things to listen out for in the music. For example, in the first movement the timpani sometimes play glissandos. This means that the pitch of the notes slides up or down. The player needs to have timpani with pedals to do this. This movement is in sonata form.

The second movement sounds very creepy. Bartók quite often wrote music which sounded like insects at night. This is one of his “night pieces”. In the climax to this exciting music Piano One plays lots of glissandos.

The last movement is a big contrast to the atmosphere in the slow movement. It is like a lively dance.

The sonata was first performed in Basle in 1938 with the composer playing one piano and his wife Ditta playing the other one. Fritz Schiesser and Philipp Rühlig played the percussion. It immediately became very popular and has since been one of his best- known works. Bartók also made a version for the two pianos to play with an orchestra, but it is not normally performed like that.


Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)

Concerto for Orchestra is the title of a work for orchestra by the Hungarian composer Béla Bartók. It is one of the most famous orchestral pieces of the mid-20th century.

Several composers have written works to which they gave the title “Concerto for Orchestra”. It is an unusual title because a concerto is normally a work for one solo instrument and an orchestra. The soloist is given a lot of opportunity to show off his (or her) talent. In a “Concerto for Orchestra” there is no soloist, but the composer thinks it is different from a symphony because a lot of the instruments in the orchestra are treated like soloists during the piece. This is what happens in Béla Bartók’s concerto.

The work was written in 1943 and it was first performed on 1 December 1944 in the Boston Symphony Hall by the Boston Symphony Orchestra with the conductor Serge Koussevitzky. It was immediately a great success. Koussevitszky asked Bartók to write this piece. Bartók had just arrived in United States from Hungary. He had to flee because of World War II. Bartók had no money and so he was glad to get some work.

Bartók often uses ideas from the Classical music period in this work. He also uses ideas from folk music from central Europe, especially Hungarian music. Quite often the music is not in a major or minor key. He uses folk scales which have different kinds of scales called modes. Sometimes tunes sound like folk music. At other times there are drones in the horns and strings.

The orchestra needs 3 flutes (one doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (one doubling cor anglais), 3 clarinets (one doubling bass clarinet), 3 bassoons (one doubling contrabassoon), 4 French horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, side drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tamtam, 2 harps and strings

The first movement, called "Introduzione" by Bartók, is a slow introduction which sounds like music describing the night. This is something Bartók did several times in his works. It is in sonata form.

The second movement is called "Giuoco delle coppie" which means "Game of pairs". Pairs of instruments take it in turns to play a tune, each pair playing music which is separated by a different interval.

The third movement, called "Elegia" by Bartók, is another slow movement, typical of Bartók's night music.

The fourth movement, called "Intermezzo interrotto" by Bartók, has a flowing melody with a time signature which keeps changing. There is also a theme which pokes fun at the march tune in Dmitri Shostakovich's ""Leningrad" Symphony (No. 7)". There is a very difficult bit for the timpani where the player has to play lots of different pitches in a very short section.

The fifth movement, called "Finale" is a very fast movement with lots of energy and plenty of folk tunes.


Bluebird K7

Bluebird K7 was a boat built for Donald Campbell to break the World Water Speed Record. Bluebird was a special kind of boat, called a hydroplane, that skims over the top of the water instead of pushing through it like a normal boat. Bluebird was powered by a jet engine. It set new world water speed records seven times; the fastest was 276 mph (445 km/h). Bluebird was destroyed when Campbell tried to set an eighth record by going faster than 300 mph (480 km/h) on Coniston Water in 1967.

Campbell had been using his father's boat, Bluebird K4, to try and set new records. Bluebird K4 was destroyed when its structure broke. After this, Donald had the idea for a jet powered hydroplane to take the world water speed record from the American propeller hydroplane Slo-mo-shun. Ken and Lewis Norris designed and built K7 based on Donald's ideas.

K7 was a three-point hydroplane, meaning that when going quickly the boat only touched the water in three places, one point near the back of the boat and one point at the back of the two sponsons (the sponsons are the floats either side of the boat, near its front in the photos). It was built of aluminium on top of a steel frame and was at first powered by a small turbojet.

The name K7 came from the rating given to the boat by Lloyds of London

Campbell set seven world water speed records in K7 between 1955 and 1964:


In 1966, Campbell decided he wanted to make Bluebird go faster than 300 mph (480 km/h).

Bluebird's old engine was not strong enough to make it go this fast, so it was replaced with a more powerful Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engine taken from an old fighter jet. Many other changes were made, the tail fin from the fighter was attached to Bluebird's rear, the cover over the cockpit was changed to push through the air more easily, and the floats at the front were also changed. Bluebird was taken to Coniston Water to be tested in 1966. The tests did not go well, the weather was too bad to test the boat while moving, so it was tied down and tested without moving instead. When testing the engine it sucked in too much air and caused parts of the boat to break. The engine was broken when the broken parts were sucked into it. This meant that the entire engine had to be replaced.

At the end of November the weather was good enough for some test runs, but the speed was a lot lower than Bluebird's old records. The fuel pumps could not pump enough fuel to the engine so it could not run at full speed. The problem was fixed by fitting two fuel pumps instead of one.

On 4 January 1967, the problems had all been fixed, the weather was good and Campbell decided he wanted to try and break the speed record. For a world record to be official, a boat trying to set a record has to make two runs at full speed that are timed by people who are not part of the record breaking team. The official speed is the average speed of the two runs. On the first run Bluebird's speed was 297.6 mph (478.9 km/h) which was fast enough to be a new record, but not quite as fast as Campbell wanted to go. To set a record of more than 300 mph the second run would have to be 302.5 mph or faster.

The plan for the world record attempt was for Bluebird to stop at the far end of the lake and refuel from another boat that had been put there for that purpose. Taking time to refuel would also give the lake, which had been disturbed by the first run, time to settle down again. On the actual record attempt, Campbell decided not to refuel and instead started on his second run immediately. Why he did this is unknown.

At the start of the second run, Bluebird was going faster than 320 mph (510 km/h) and would have easily broken the 300 mph target, but as the boat travelled along the lake it started tramping (which means rocking from side to side). Bluebird hit a wave made on the lake from its own first run and the boat spun out of the water. When it hit the water again it broke into pieces and sank. Donald Campbell was killed in the crash. His teddy bear mascot was found floating in the lake later on but Campbell's body could not be found.

In 2001 a diver called Bill Smith led a salvage team which found Bluebird on the bottom of Coniston Water, and later lifted the wreck back to dry land. The wreck was taken apart carefully to keep it from rusting and is now being put back together again. There was a lot of damage caused in the crash but it can all be repaired. Bill Smith also got a new engine for Bluebird and hopes to return the boat to full working order.

Donald Campbell's body was also found in 2001. He was buried on 12th September 2001 in Coniston cemetery.

On Thursday 7 December 2006, Gina Campbell, Donald's daughter, formally gifted the recovered wreckage of Bluebird K7 to the Ruskin Museum in Coniston on behalf of the Campbell Family Heritage Trust. 
In agreement with the Campbell Family Heritage Trust and the museum, Bill Smith is to organise the restoration of the boat, which is now under way.[9] The intention is to rebuild K7 back to running order circa 4 January 1967. Gina Campbell commented: "I've decided to secure the future of Bluebird for the people of Coniston, the Ruskin Museum and the people of the world". 

TM 65 77

The Telamiina 65 77 (Track mine model 66, with detonator model 77) is a Finnish Army standard issue anti-tank mine. The mine is made of 9.5 kg (~21 lbs) of cast TNT. The mine is armed with a detonator that is set to explode when at least 100 kg (~220 lbs) of pressure is applied to it. The blast effect of the mine blows the track off of tanks and damages their driving wheel.

The mine is also known as the "Kuntonappi" ("Fitness pill") or the "Tellu" (female name, shortened form of Tellervo9).

Where Sleeplessness Is Rest from Nightmares

Where Sleeplessness Is Rest from Nightmares is the very first album by Chicago metalcore band Arma Angelus.

All music composed by Arma Angelus. All lyrics written by Pete Wentz.

Arma Angelus

Arma Angelus was a metalcore band from Chicago. The band started in 1998 and broke up in 2002. The members of the band were Peter Wentz (singer, now plays bass guitar in Fall Out Boy), Tim McIlrath (played bass guitar, now lead singer of Rise Against), Jay Jancetic (played guitar, now plays guitar for the Chicago band Holy Roman Empire), Daniel Binaei (played guitar), Adam Bishop (played guitar, now an English teacher at San Dieguito High School Academy in Encinitas, California), and Timothy Miller (played the drums).

After Tim quit to start a new band called Rise Against, he was replaced in 1999 by Christopher Gutierrez. Gutierrez is now a touring author and spoken word artist. He was replaced as the bass guitar player for one tour by Joseph Trohman (now plays guitar in the band Fall Out Boy). Trohman was not a good fit for the band in terms of knowing about the music style and in terms of stage presence. He was replaced mid-tour when the band flew Chris Gutierrez out to New York for the final half of their tour, including a stop at CBGB's. 

In the last Arma Angelus concert, Patrick Stump played drums, Pete Wentz sang, Joe Trohman played guitar along with Adam Bishop, and Christopher Gutierrez on bass.



51 Pegasi

51 Pegasi is a star that is like our Sun and can be found 15.4 parsecs (50.1 light-years) away from the Earth in the constellation Pegasus. It was the first Sun-like star, other than the Sun, found to have a planet orbiting it, this discovery was first made public in 1995.

The exoplanet's discovery was made public on October 6, 1995 by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. The discovery was made using the radial velocity method at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, using a tool called the ELODIE spectrograph that is used to find planets that are outside our Solar System. 

The star itself has an apparent brightness of 5.49, and because of this it is able to be seen from the Earth with binoculars, or with the naked eye if it is dark outside. 51 Pegasi is a yellow dwarf star that is thought to be around 7.5 billion years old, which is somewhat older than our Sun. 51 Pegasi is also 4-6% more massive than our Sun with more metal content. However, it is running low on hydrogen. 

In 1996 astronomers Baliunas, Sokoloff, and Soon calculated that it takes 51 Pegasi b 37 days to orbit 51 Pegasi.

After the announcement, on October 12, 1995, more proof that this star did exist came from Dr. Geoffrey Marcy from San Francisco State University and Dr. R. Paul Butler from the University of California, Berkeley using the Hamilton Spectrograph at the Lick Observatory near San Jose in California.

51 Pegasi b is the first discovered planet of its parent star, 51 Pegasi. If any more are discovered they will be named 51 Pegasi c, 51 Pegasi d, and so on. The planet has been informally named Bellerophon. After its discovery, many teams proved its existence and continued to find out more about its properties, including the fact that it orbits very close to the star, has estimated temperatures around 1200 Celsius, and has a minimum mass about half that of Jupiter.


Gumbasia

Gumbasia is a very short movie made in 1953 by Art Clokey. "Gumbasia" was a clay animation movie. Clokey became famous for his two series "Gumby" and "Davey and Goliath" which also used clay animation.

Clokey made "Gumbasia" while he was studying at the University of Southern California and being taught by Slavko Vorkapich. It was Clokey's first clay animation movie and it was only 3 minutes and 45 seconds long. The movie showed moving lumps of clay set to music in a copy of Walt Disney's "Fantasia". Gumbasia was made in a style Vorkapich taught called Kinesthetic Film Principles. This style, which uses camera movements and stop-motion editing, is used in later Gumby movies. After watching "Gumbasia", movie producer Sam Engel decided to give Clokey money to make a 15 minute movie that became the first Gumby movie -- "Gumby Goes to the Moon".

This was to honor August Belmont. The townspeople hoped Mr. Belmont would provide financial support but he did not.

Joker (comics)

The Joker is a fictional character, a comic book supervillain published by DC Comics. He is an archenemy of Batman. The character's creator has been disputed between Jerry Robinson, Bill Finger, and Bob Kane, even though many believe Robinson created the character. The Joker first appeared in Batman #1 (Spring 1940).

Throughout his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a master criminal whose characterization has varied from that of a violent psychopath to a goofy trickster-thief. He is the archenemy of Batman, having been directly responsible for numerous tragedies in Batman's life, including the paralysis of Barbara Gordon and the death of Jason Todd, the second Robin.

Joker's creation was inspired by Conrad Veidt's role in the 1928 silent movie "The Man Who Laughs".

The Joker possesses no superhuman abilities, instead using his expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. The Joker sometimes works with other Gotham City supervillains, such as the Penguin and Two-Face, and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League, but these relationships often collapse due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos. The 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the Joker in his former psychiatrist, Harley Quinn, who becomes his villainous sidekick. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought other heroes, including Superman and Wonder Woman.

Throughout the character's long history, there have been several different origin tales; they most commonly depict him as falling into a vat of chemical waste, which bleaches his skin and turns his hair green and his lips bright red, giving him the appearance of a clown.

The Joker has appeared in movies, TV series and video games; he was played by Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, Joaquin Phoenix and Barry Keoghan in movies. On animated shows/movies he is portrayed by Mark Hamill, Richard Epcar, Kevin Michael Richardson, Larry Storch, Jeff Bennett, and John DiMaggio.

Both Ledger and Phoenix won an Academy Award for their portrayal of the character, making the Joker the second character to have its actor win an Academy Award more than once.

70 Virginis b

70 Virginis b is an extrasolar planet that is around 60 light-years away from the Earth in the constellation of Virgo. The finding of this planet was announced in 1996 by astronomers Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. 70 Virginis was one of the first stars that was known to have planets orbiting it. When first announced, 70 Virginis b was thought to be inside its star's habitable zone, but proof was later found that the planet has an eccentric orbit, closer to its parent.

70 Virginis b is a Jupiter-type extrasolar planet that orbits around 70 Virginis every 116 days. It has 7.5 times the mass of Jupiter. Its surface gravity is thought to be about two to three times that of Jupiter's. At the time that it was found in January 1996, it was thought that the star was only 29 light years away from the Earth. This could explain why the star was less bright based on its apparent magnitude (measure of brightness). As a result, the planet's orbit was thought to be in the habitable zone and the planet was given the nickname "Goldilocks" (not too cold or too hot). The Hipparcos satellite later showed that the star was farther away from 70 Virginis and therefore its brightness was a result of the planet being too hot to be in the habitable zone.

Scholasticism

Scholasticism is a way of thinking and teaching knowledge. It was developed in the Middle Ages. It started when people wanted to bring together what is called "classical philosophy" with the teachings of 
Christian theology. Classical philosophy is the philosophy developed in Ancient Greece. 
Scholasticism is not a philosophy or a theology, but rather a way of teaching and learning. Scholasticism emphasises the use of dialectic. The main purpose of dialectic is to find an answer to a question, or to show that a contradiction can be resolved.

Scholasticism was started by people like Saint Ambrose and St. Augustine. They tried to use philosophy to help explain the doctrine and mysteries of the church. Ambrose and Augustine were among the first Church fathers who brought Christian ideas and Greek philosophy together.

The main figures of scholasticism were Peter Abelard, Albertus Magnus, Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Bonaventure and, most importantly, Thomas Aquinas. Summa Theologica is an ambitious synthesis of Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine.

In the 13th century, the teachings of Aristotle were considered more important than those of Plato. Scholastic education was very much based on written texts, and with arguments for and against ideas in those texts. In this way it differed greatly from modern science, which is based on observations from nature. In Aristotle the scholastics chose someone who was himself quite an original investigator of the natural world. But the scholastics themselves dealt almost entirely with the world in manuscripts written in two ancient languages. One was in Latin, the language of the Vulgate Bible and the other was Ancient Greek. Greek opened the doors to the writings of the Greek philosophers in their own language, at least so far as their works survived. The motto of Boethius “As far as you are able, join faith to reason” reminds us that all scholastics were mediaeval Christians. Their main concern was to see how the Greek ideas could be fitted into their religious view of the world.


916 America

916 America is a minor planet that is orbiting the Sun in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter.

It was discovered on 7 August 1915 by the Soviet astronomer Grigory Nikolaevich Neujmin at Simeis, Ukraine. It was originally called 916I, but was renamed "916 America" on 24 February 1923 after the Council of Astronomers at Pulkovo Observatory decided to pay tribute to "the friendly relations of the astronomical observatories and astronomers". Another possible reason for the name was as a mark of thankfulness for the help given during the famine in Crimea by the American Relief Administration under President Herbert Hoover.

In 1986, believing that the asteroid was of S-type and that it had a diameter of 15 km, the length of 916 America's day was thought to be 38 hours. Observations by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite have since shown that it has a diameter of 33.2±1.3 km, with an absolute magnitude of 11.20 and an albedo (the extent to which it reflects light) of 0.053±0.004.

"Beat It" is a song by singer Michael Jackson. It was produced by Jackson and Quincy Jones. It is on his sixth album, "Thriller" (1982). It was released as the album's third single on February 14, 1983. There is also a music video for the song. The song has a guitar solo by Eddie Van Halen. He chose to make the guitar solo without getting paid. It got the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Best Male Rock Vocal Performance in 1984.

"Beat It" was number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100 for three weeks. "Billboard" said it was one of the top five songs of 1983. The song is certified platinum by the RIAA. Over 11 million copies of the song have been sold. It is one of the best-selling singles ever made. "Beat It" was number one on music charts in many countries, such as Spain, Canada, New Zealand, and the Netherlands.

The song also has a music video. It shows Jackson stopping two gangs from fighting each other, and then dancing with them. The video was very popular. It helped make Jackson a pop icon. Many people say the song and video were important for pop culture.

"Weird Al" Yankovic made a parody of the song called "Eat It". Fall Out Boy covered the song with John Mayer on their 2008 album "Folie à Deux".

Jackson made a demo version of the song at his house. Other people that made music helped him make it. The drum sounds for the song were made on a drum machine. The bass guitar sounds for the song were made using a bass guitar and a keyboard. This style of making bass guitar sounds was used in the main song. Jermaine Jackson has said the song was inspired by things that happened when the Jackson family lived in Gary, Indiana.

Jackson and Jones asked Eddie Van Halen, the main guitar player for Van Halen, to make a guitar solo for the song. Van Halen recorded the guitar solo for free. He said that he did it "as a favor". The rest of the band thought he should have asked for money, but he did not want to. Van Halen recorded the guitar solo after Jones and Jackson came to his house. Two versions of the guitar solo were made. In 2015, Van Halen said he also changed the song so that his solo was in the key of E.

When Van Halen was recording the solo, a loudspeaker started burning. Because of this, one of the people recording the music said "This must be really good!" Van Halen later said that working with Jackson was one of the best moments in his career.

"Beat It" was released as a single. It was released on 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl records.

Diomede Islands

The Diomede Islands are two islands in the Bering Strait, about halfway between mainland Alaska and Siberia. They are also called Gvozdev Islands in Russian. There are two islands, called "Big Diomede" and "Little Diomede" respectively. 

Little Diomede is also known as Krusenstern Island, but there are also other places with this name. The Eskimos who live there call it "Ignaluk". 

The other island, Big Diomede, is also known as Imaqliq, Inaliq, Nunarbuk or Ratmanov Island. 

Big Diomede belongs to Siberia, Little Diomede is part of Alaska.

The Chukchi Sea is to the north and the Bering Sea to the south of the islands. to the southeast is Fairway Rock, an islet which is usually not considered part of the Diomede Islands.

The islands are separated by an international border and the International Date Line which is approximately from each island. At the closest distance between Little Diomede and Big Diomede, the two islands are only about apart. 

People who live on Little Diomede Island do so in a small village called Diomede, on the west side of the island.

There are plans to build a connection between Siberia and Alaska, either as a bridge or a tunnel (Bering Strait bridge spanning the Bering Strait). In that case, the Diomede Islands would be a halfway point, as they are about the middle of the Bering Strait.

They are sometimes called Tomorrow Island (Big Diomede) and Yesterday Isle (Little Diomede) because the big island is 21 hours ahead of the small one (except when changing daylight saving time, done on different dates).

The people who lived on Big Diomede Island were moved to mainland Russia by the Soviet government. A small Russian military base is currently on the island. Little Diomede has an Inupiat population of 170, mostly in the City of Diomede. This village there has a school, and a local store. Some Eskimos there are famous for their ivory carving. Mail is delivered by helicopter, weather permitting.

Krusenstern Island

Krusenstern Island (and similar names) is a place name honoring the Baltic German explorer Adam Johann von Krusenstern (1770 – 1846). It was and sometimes still is used for a number of places in the Pacific Ocean:


Clay animation

Clay animation is one of many ways to make a stop motion animation. Each animated piece, either character or background, can be formed and reformed into different shapes. People making a clay animation usually use something soft, like Plasticine clay. 

Most animation is made the same way, whether it is cel animation or stop motion. Each frame, or still picture, is recorded on film or digital media and then played back quickly. When played back at a frame rate of more than 10–12 frames per second, the human mind sees the series of slightly changing, rapidly playing images as movement. To us it seems as if the object is moving by itself. This way of tricking the mind into seeing "movement" is the way that all moving images work, from zoetrope to movies to videogames. The way CGI animations are made is different from the frame by frame method.

In clay animation, each object is made in clay, usually around a wire skeleton called an armature. The object is put on the set (background) and a still picture (one frame of film) is taken. The object or character is then moved slightly by hand. Another picture is taken, and the object is moved slightly again. This is repeated over and over. To get the best results, special care is taken to make sure that each frame is the same as the one before. For example, the lighting has to be the same and the object has to be put back in exactly the right place. The only thing that should be different is the slight change the animator makes to the object.

Making a stop-motion animation using clay is hard work. Normal movies use 24 frames per second (frame/s). Animation usually uses "doubles" or "twos"; that is using two frames for each shot. This means that 12 changes are made for one second of movie. For a 30-minute movie, there would be about 21,600 stops to change the objects for the next frame. For a full-length (90-minute) movie, there would be about 64,800 stops. IF some of the parts were done with only a single, not double frame, there would be even more stops. Great care must be taken to make sure that the object is not moved by accident. For full-length movies, animators now use rubber silicone and resin-cast objects. One foam-rubber method has been called "Foamation" by Will Vinton.

Some famous clay animation movies have been made. Examples include:

The word "Claymation" is a registered trademark in the United States. It was registered by Will Vinton in 1978 to describe his clay animation films. The word is often used incorrectly to describe any clay animation movie.

Space Race

The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War enemies, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), to achieve better spaceflight capability than the other. It had its origins in the intercontinental ballistic missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations following World War II. Both governments saw having better spaceflight technology as necessary for national security. The Space Race enabled the first launches of artificial satellites, uncrewed space probes to the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and ultimately to the Moon.

The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites during the "International Geophysical Year" (July 1, 1957 to December 31, 1958), by declaring they would also launch a satellite "in the near future". The Soviet Union achieved the first successful artificial satellite launch on October 4, 1957 of Sputnik 1, and sent the first human to space with the orbital flight of Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961. The USSR demonstrated an early lead in the race with these and other early firsts over the next few years, including flight durations measured in days instead of hours, the first multi-person crewed spaceflight, and the first spacewalk.

But the USSR lost its early lead after US president John F. Kennedy raised the stakes by setting a goal of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth". American spaceflight capability overtook that of the Soviets with flights up to two weeks long; two craft meeting in space (rendezvous) and joining (docking); astronauts working outside spacecraft; and using high-energy liquid hydrogen as rocket fuel in the Saturn family of rockets. Kennedy's Moon landing goal was achieved in July 1969, with the flight of Apollo 11, which sent and returned three men and landed two of them, a singular achievement far outweighing any combination of Soviet achievements. The USSR pursued two crewed lunar programs, but failed to develop a launch vehicle powerful enough to land one human on the Moon before the US, and eventually canceled them to concentrate on Earth orbital space stations, while the US landed five more Apollo crews on the Moon.

A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew and joint development of an international docking standard APAS-75. Apollo–Soyuz began a period of transition from the Space Race to an age of US / Russian space cooperation by December 1991, when the dissolution of the Soviet Union brought the end of the Cold War and enabled the Shuttle-Mir and International Space Station programs between the US and the newly founded Russian Federation.


Oligotroph

An oligotroph is an organism that can survive with relatively few nutrients. Because there are few nutrients, such organisms grow slower. Their metabolism usually runs at a slower rate. The population density is generally low. 

Environments where oligotrophs can be found include the deep oceans.

Supersaturation

Supersaturation in chemical solutions is when a solution contains more of a solute than can be dissolved in it. This usually makes some of the solute separate itself from the solution.



Dyspnea

Dyspnea or dyspnoea (said "disp-nee-ah") is shortness of breath. Some research says that about 27% of people suffer it. 

There are many different causes of dyspnea. Some include:



Epiglottitis

Epiglottitis is inflammation of the epiglottis, which is the flap that sits at the base of the tongue, which keeps food from going into the trachea (windpipe). Due to its place in the airway, swelling of this can interfere with breathing and can set up a medical emergency.

Epiglottitis usually happens in children. It can be accompanied with fever, problems swallowing, drooling, and stridor. In children, it must always be considered a medical emergency requiring urgent treatment in an emergency room at a hospital.

Lyme disease

Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease. It is caused by bacteria of the genus "Borrelia". The disease is carried by ticks which are parasitic on mammals such as mice, deer, and people. In other words, ticks are the vector which transmits the disease.

It is the most common tick-borne infection in the United States. Although Allen Steere realized in 1978 that Lyme disease was a tick-borne disease, the cause of the disease remained a mystery until 1982. It can cause joint swelling, rashes, and neurological symptoms.

Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics. Depending on disease stage and antibiotic used, treatment is usually between 10 and 28 days.


Travis Childers

Travis Wayne Childers (born March 29, 1958 in Booneville, Mississippi, United States) is an American politician. He represented Mississippi's 1st district in the U.S. House of Representatives from the May 2008 special election until 2011. 

Childers did not win re-election in on November 2, 2010, he was defeated by former state senator Alan Nunnelee.


Carbonated water

Carbonated water, also known as soda water, sparkling water, fizzy water, seltzer, and water with gas, is plain water into which carbon dioxide gas has been dissolved. Most soft drinks have carbonated water as a base. The process of dissolving carbon dioxide gas is called carbonation. It results in the formation of carbonic acid.

There are special machines that allow to make soda water at home.

The process of carbonation can also occur naturally to produce carbonated mineral water. Beer and wine are carbonated by fermentation.

Carbonated water was discovered by Joseph Pristly in 1767.

Eastern European Summer Time

Eastern European Summer Time (EEST) is one of the names of UTC+3 time zone. This zone is 3 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time. It is used as a summer daylight saving time in some European, North African, and Middle Eastern countries. During the winter, the Eastern European Time (UTC+2) is used.

The following countries and territories use Eastern European Summer Time during the summer:


In 1991 EEST was used also in Moscow and Samara time zones of Russia.

African Sanctus

African Sanctus is a musical composition for choir, soloists, orchestra and prerecorded tape by David Fanshawe. It was composed in 1972.

"African Sanctus" is the best-known of Fanshawe's works. It was composed after Fanshawe had made journeys to Africa up the river Nile between 1969 and 1973. The shape of his journey forms the shape of a cross. This had a religious meaning for Fanshawe. He made recordings on tape of the people he met singing their traditional music. A lot of this music had never been recorded before. When he returned home to Britain he composed the "African Sanctus". Some of the recordings he had made in Africa are played as part of the performance. The choir who sing live at the concert are singing some of the words of the traditional Christian Latin Mass.

The recordings are from Egypt, the Sudan, Uganda and Kenya.

At first it was called "African Revelations", but then the title was changed to "African Sanctus". It was first performed in London by the Saltarello Choir in July 1972, and was later played on BBC Radio on United Nations Day. A documentary film was made three years later showing how the work had been composed.


The work has been performed in many places in Britain and all round the world. Fanshawe comes to many of these concerts personally.

In 1994 David Fanshawe composed an extra movement for a new recording of the work, the Dona Nobis Pacem - A Hymn for World Peace, which completed the Agnus Dei. Based on this new recording, the BBC commissioned the maker of the 1975 documentary, Herbert Chappell, to make a new programme, "African Sanctus Revisited",



David Fanshawe

David Fanshawe (born 19 April 1942 in Devon, England; died 5 July 2010) was an English composer and explorer. He wrote a large amount of music, especially for television programmes. His best-known composition is a choral work called "African Sanctus".

Fanshawe went to school at St George's School, Windsor Castle and Stowe School. He started his career as a musician and producer for documentary films. He studied composition at the Royal College of Music. He became known for the music he wrote for films and TV. In 1970 he performed "Salaams" in the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London. This was a work based on the rhythms of pearl divers in Bahrain.

He spent several years travelling to many parts of the world collecting recordings of people singing their own traditional music. He travelled to the Middle East, then to Africa and to islands of the Pacific Ocean. In all these places he had to get to know the people and get them to trust him so that they would let him record their music.

His "African Sanctus" was a result of his trip down the Nile. It combines recordings he made there with a choir and orchestra singing. It has been performed thousands of times all over the world.

Fanshawe died on 5 July 2010.


Haley Barbour

Haley Reeves Barbour (born October 22, 1947) is an American politician. He was the governor of Mississippi from 2004 to 2012. He was mentioned as a possible candidate for President of the United States in the 2012. In April 2011, Barbour said he will not run for president.

Barbour was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi, where he was raised as the youngest of three sons of Grace LeFlore (née Johnson) and Jeptha Fowlkes Barbour, Jr. Haley's father, a lawyer, died when Barbour was two years old. Barbour's father who was a Circuit Judge had an inmate to assist him when Judge Barbour became ill. Leon Turner, who was given a posthumous pardon by Barbour in the closing days of his administration, had helped to raise him.

Moose Jaw is a city in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan; about 70 km west of the capital Regina.

Playpen

A playpen is where a baby plays in an enclosed structure. It is designed to keep the baby safe when the parent is not there. The earliest use of the word playpen in the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1902.

Playpens were once made of wood. They were square shaped, with vertical wooden bars on four sides, so that the child can see out. The floor of the playpen is usually a soft mat. The walls of the playpen are usually higher than the height of the child, so the child can not climb out.

Modern playpens can be moved easily. They are usually made of a basic metal and plastic support system with mesh, soft plastic or nylon sides. Sometimes a bassinet can be put on the top for the baby to sleep in, or be changed in, until four months of age. Some have mobiles, side pockets for supplies and toys, night lights, music boxes, or a CD player for the child to listen to music while sleeping or playing. Portable playpens come in different sizes, but most can be rolled or folded up for easy storage and transport.

It is important that the playpen being used is safe for the child. Unsafe playpens may collapse which could injure the baby.

The Planets

The Planets Op. 32 is a seven-movement orchestral musical suite by the British composer Gustav Holst, written between 1914 and 1916. The first complete public performance happened during World War I on 10 October 1918 in Birmingham, with Appleby Matthews directing the orchestra. However, an earlier premiere for only a small group of people was held on 29 September 1918 in the Queen's Hall in London, with the orchestra directed by Adrian Boult. The seven pieces are all named after planets.

Kota Kinabalu

Kota Kinabalu (), formerly Jesselton, is the capital of Sabah state in Malaysia. It is also the capital of the West Coast Division of Sabah. The city is on the northwest coast of Borneo facing the South China Sea. The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park is on one side and Mount Kinabalu, which gave the city its name, is nearby. Kota Kinabalu proper has a population of 579,304, while the larger urban area has an estimated population of 700,000. It is the largest urban centre in Sabah and the sixth largest in Malaysia.

Kota Kinabalu is often known as K.K. within Malaysia and internationally. It is a major tourist destination and a popular gateway for travellers visiting Sabah and Borneo. Kinabalu National Park is about 90 kilometres from the city and there are many tourist attractions in and around the city. Kota Kinabalu is also one of the major industrial and commercial centres of East Malaysia. These two factors combine to make Kota Kinabalu one of the fastest growing cities in Malaysia.

In the late 1800s, the British North Borneo Company (BNBC) began to establish colonies throughout North Borneo (now Sabah). In 1882, the Company founded a small settlement on Gaya Island (Pulau Gaya), which was already inhabited by the Bajau people. In 1897, this first settlement was burned and destroyed by Bajau rebels led by Mat Salleh.

After the rebellion, the Company decided to relocate the settlement to the more easily defended mainland opposite Pulau Gaya. A nearby fishing village named "Api-Api" (see "Original names" below), was the next settlement of the Company. This new location was then designated as the main harbour and port, as well as the terminus for the North Borneo Railway. It was expanded and renamed "Jesselton", named after Sir Charles Jessel, the then Vice Chairman of the Company.

Eventually, Jesselton became a major trading post of North Borneo, dealing in rubber, rattan, honey, and wax. The new railway was used to transport goods to Jesselton harbour. Bajau uprisings during these times were not uncommon, and the Company worked to quell the long-standing threat of piracy in the region.

Jesselton was razed by the retreating British early in World War II to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Japanese. After the Japanese takeover of Borneo, it was again renamed Api. Rebellions against the Japanese military administration have taken place in Api. One major rebellion occurred in 1943 by the group called Kinabalu Guerrillas, consisting of local inhabitants. The rebellion was however quelled by the Japanese forces, after their leader, Albert Kwok, was arrested and executed in 1944. At the later stages of the war, what remained of the town was destroyed again by Allied bombings as part of the Borneo Campaign in 1945, leaving only three buildings standing. The war in North Borneo ended with the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army by Lieutenant General Baba Masao in Labuan on September 10, 1945.

After the war, the British North Borneo Company returned to administer Jesselton but was unable to finance the huge costs of reconstruction. They gave control of North Borneo to the British Crown in 1946. The new colonial government elected to rebuild Jesselton as the capital of North Borneo instead of Sandakan, which had also been destroyed by the war.

When North Borneo together with Sarawak, Singapore & Federation of Malaya formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, the state became known as Sabah and Jesselton remained its capital. Jesselton was renamed Kota Kinabalu on September 30, 1968 and received official city status from the Malaysian government on February 2, 2000.

Kota Kinabalu is named after Mount Kinabalu, about 90 kilometres east-northeast of the city. The meaning and origin of the name "Kinabalu" is uncertain. One theory suggests it means "Chinese widow", where "Kina" meaning "Chinese" (person) in Kadazandusun language, and "balu" meaning "widow" in Malay language. This theory derives from a folk tale about a Chinese prince who came to the mountain in search of a giant pearl which was guarded by a dragon at the top of the mountain. While he was here, he married a local woman but later returned to China and left the woman heartbroken. Alternatively, it is also argued that "Kinabalu" or "Akinabalu" is the name of the dragon which guards the giant pearl itself. Another theory suggests that the term is derived from the name "Aki Nabalu" meaning the "revered place of the dead", in which, "Aki" means "ancestors" or "grandfather", and "Nabalu" being a name for the mountain in the Dusun language. Finally there is also a source claiming that the term originated from "Ki Nabalu", where "Ki" meaning "have" or "exist", and "Nabalu" meaning "spirit of the dead".

"Kota" is a Malay word for a "fort", "town", or a "city". It is also used formally in a few other Malaysian towns and cities, for example, Kota Bahru, Kota Tinggi, and Kota Kemuning. It could also be used informally to refer to any towns or cities. Henceforth, a direct translation of the name "Kota Kinabalu" into English would be "City of Kinabalu" or "Kinabalu City".

Besides Jesselton, there has been a number of other claims as to the original name for Kota Kinabalu. The most popular, as mentioned above, is "Api-Api", or sometimes simply "Api", which is a Malay word meaning 'Fire'. It was apparently named as such by the mainly Bajau locals to denote the blazing of the British administrative office in Pulau Gaya instigated by Mat Salleh, as well as other blazing incidents normally perpetrated by pirates. There were claims however that it was actually named after a nearby river called "Sungai Api-Api". Another theory states that "Api-Api" is the local name of the common "Avicennia" tree that grows in abundance around the area. Transliterated into the formal Chinese name of "Ya Bi" (亚庇 yà bì), the Hakkas here too adopted this name (亚庇,"ah-bi" which pronounced in Hakka, Chinese dialects) and some still use this name to this day. Besides Api-Api, another suggested historical name was "Deasoka", which roughly means "below the coconut tree" in the Bajau language. The Bajau locals purportedly used this name to refer to a village on the southern part of the city which was filled with coconut trees. Another name was "Singgah Mata" which literally mean "transit eye", but can be loosely translated as meaning "pleasing to the eye". It is a name purportedly given by fishermen from Pulau Gaya referring to the strip of land of what is today Kota Kinabalu city center. Today, all these names have been immortalised into names of streets or buildings around the city. Some examples are: "Lintasan Deasoka", "Api-Api Centre", "Jalan Singgah Mata", and "Jesselton Point".

Being the capital city of Sabah, Kota Kinabalu plays an important role in the political and economic welfare of the population in the entire state. It is the seat of the state government where almost all of their ministries and agencies are based. Most of the Malaysian federal government agencies and departments are also in Kota Kinabalu. The Sabah State Legislative Assembly is at nearby Likas Bay. There are four Members of Parliament (MPs) representing four parliamentary constituencies in the city: Sepanggar ("P.171"), Kota Kinabalu ("P.172"), Putatan ("P.173"), and Penampang ("P.174"). The city also elects 9 representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Karambunai, Inanam, Likas, Api-Api, Luyang, Tanjung Aru, Petagas, Kepayan, and Moyog.

Kota Kinabalu currently has five sister cities.

The internal roads linking different parts of the city are generally state roads constructed and maintained by the state Public Works Department. Most major internal roads are dual-carriageways. One of the major road here is Jalan Lintas-Jalan Tuaran Bypass, which together serves almost as a ring road, circling the city and connecting the districts and suburbs surrounding the city, namely, Putatan, Penampang, Luyang, Likas, Inanam, Menggatal, Sepanggar, and Tuaran. There is currently no freeway in the city nor in any part of Sabah. The city is linked by highways to distant towns around Sabah and these are mainly federal roads maintained by the national Public Works Department. Highway routes from Kota Kinabalu include:

Public transportation:

Regular bus services operate around the city. Minibuses or vans are also used besides buses as an alternative public transportation. There are two main bus terminals in the central business area. The terminal along Jalan Tun Razak provides internal bus services towards different part of the city and its outskirts. Another terminal near Bandaran Berjaya provides intercity services towards destinations south of the city (Papar, Tenom, Beaufort, and others). The Kota Kinabalu (North) Bus Terminal in Inanam provides intercity buses heading towards destinations north and north-east of the city (Tuaran, Kudat, Ranau, Sandakan, Tawau, Semporna, and others). Taxicabs too are around the city.

A railway system formerly known as the North Borneo Railway was established in 1896 by the British North Borneo Company. It was built for the main purpose of transporting commodities from the interior to the port in Kota Kinabalu during the British occupation. The railway line connects Kota Kinabalu with Tenom and several other towns in between, and it is the only railway system operating in East Malaysia. Today the railway is known as Sabah State Railway, and it provides daily services for commuters, travellers, as well as for cargo transportation. A separate company operates the leisure tour also called the "North Borneo Railway", which caters mainly for tourists. The train station and terminus are in Tanjung Aru.

Kota Kinabalu International Airport (KKIA) provides flights linking the city with other domestic and international destinations. It is a secondary hub for Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia and it consists of two terminals. It is the second busiest airport in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur International Airport and it is a major gateway into Sabah and East Malaysia. It serves international flights to Bandar Seri Begawan, Shenzhen, Seoul, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau, Manila, Cebu, Singapore, Taibei, Gaoxiong, and other domestic cities. It is also a secondary hub for MASWings, which serves flights to smaller towns and rural areas in East Malaysia.

Kota Kinabalu has two ports: Kota Kinabalu Port and Sepanggar Bay Container Port (SBCP). Kota Kinabalu Port mainly loose/bulk cargo, while SBCP operates as a naval base for the Royal Malaysian Navy, oil depot and all containerised cargo. In 2004, Kota Kinabalu Port handled about 3.6 million tonnes of freight cargo, the third highest in the state after Sandakan Port, and Tawau Port. It however handles the most number of containers in the state, with 153,793 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of containers handled in 2006. Sepanggar Bay Port will have the capacity to handle 200,000 TEU annually when its container terminal is completed. All ports in Sabah are managed and operated by Sabah Ports Sdn Bhd.

Kota Kinabalu Ferry Terminal is a passenger ferry terminal at Jesselton Point near the K.K. port. It provides ferry and motorboat services to the nearby islands for tourists as well as for commuters living on the islands. There are also regular scheduled ferry services to Labuan.

The majority of the population are Muslim Malays.

Temple of Jupiter (Pompeii)

The Temple of Jupiter, Capitolium, or Temple of the Capitoline Triad was a temple in the Roman city of Pompeii in Italy. At the beginning this temple was dedicated to Jupiter alone, it was built in the mid 2nd century BC at the same time as the temple of Apollo was being worked on - this was the era at which Roman influence over Pompeii was at its height and so Roman Jupiter beat out the Greek Apollo and Jupiter(, Juno, and Minerva) in towns newly taken over by the Romans. This was also true for Pompeii, where the Temple of Jupiter that was already there was enlarged and made more Roman when the Romans took over.

Pompeii was taken over by the Romans beginning in 310 BC. It was still allowed to mostly run itself, however, until the Italic Revolt against Rome at the beginning of the 1st century BC.

The building style of the town was largely borrowed from the Greeks, but Roman rule would soon lead to changes in this style. As opposed to the previous Samnite rulers of Pompeii, the Romans thought that the building style was very important in religious as well as everyday life. Pompeii was changed into a much more public and open place. Public buildings and spaces would eventually be able to be found all over the city. 

The temple had been built in 150 BC to be a very noticeable part of the forum, and it became Pompeii's main temple after Rome took over. The inside of the temple housed the main room of the temple, which held the statues of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, and which only the priests were allowed to enter.

In 62 an earthquake shook the city of Pompeii, destroying much of the Temple of Jupiter. After this, the much smaller Temple of Jupiter Meilichios became the main place of worship to Jupiter and his group of three (triad). The first Temple of Jupiter was still waiting to be fixed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79, burying the town of Pompeii under lava and ash. The hollow temple can still be seen in Pompeii today.

Milang is small town that is found on the shores of Lake Alexandrina, just over 20 kms from Strathalbyn, South Australia.

The town was laid out in December 1853. Milang was a very important port on the Murray River System between 1860 and 1880, before the railway line was built to connect Adelaide to Morgan farther upstream.

Gilbert's potoroo

Gilbert's potoroo ("Potorous gilbertii") is an Australian marsupial, sometimes called a rat-kangaroo. It has a pointed face and it is about the size of a rabbit. Once thought to be extinct, it is listed as being critically endangered.It is the most endangered mammal and marsupial in the whole of Australia. There are only about 40 of the animals now left in the world. Gilbert's potoroo is one of the world's rarest mammals.

They live in a small area, about , on the southwest coast near Albany, Western Australia. This area is in the Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve. Gilbert's Potoroos have been released on nearby Bald Island, and are breeding successfully.

The first scientific discovery of the Gilbert’s potoroo happened in 1840, and it was named in 1841 after the English naturalist and explorer John Gilbert. Gilbert had collected several animals at King George Sound in Australia, including this potoroo. Gilbert’s potoroo was not seenagain for many years, even though many people had searched for them in the 1970s. The species was believed to be extinct for 120 years before it was re-discovered in 1994 in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve. Liz Sinclair had been studying wallabies and caught the potoroo in one of her traps.

Potoroos live under thick bushes and shrubs. They have made tunnels and paths through the bush so they can get around easily. When moving slowly they use all four legs, but to move quickly they can hop like a kangaroo. Potoroos are nocturnal and they spend their days hiding. They only come out into the open very often. They live in small groups of between three to five animals. They eat different kinds of truffles and fungi. Australia has many different kinds of truffles and potoroos like to eat many of them. Potoroos have sharp three toed claws that help them dig into the ground to find the truffles growing in the soil. After eating them, the potoroos help spread the seeds of the truffles through their wastes. Scientists have found 40 different types of fungi in the waste from a Gilbert Potoroo.

The female potoroos can have two babies in a year, but only carry one at a time. They can keep a second embryo in a state of diapause while the first embryo is growing. If the first baby does not survive, the second baby can start growing right away. It is not known how long gestation is for Gilbert’s potoroo, but it is thought to be the same as the long-nosed potoroo; about 38 days. The baby potoroo is only about long when it is born. It lives in its mother's pouch for about 4 months.

When Gilbert’s potoroo was rediscovered, more animals were captured to start a breeding program. This would help increase the numbers of potoroos. A few young were born in the first couple of years, but then breeding just stopped. Many studies have looked at what they eat, and how they live, but they are still can not get the potoroos to breed in captivity

In 2001, a group was formed called the Gilbert’s potoroo Action Group (GPAG). This group helps educate and tell people about the potoroo. It also helps with raising money for more study and captive breeding programs for Gilbert’s potoroo.

Three potoroos, one male and two females, were moved to Bald Island in August 2005. This island is free from other animals, like cats and foxes, that would eat the potoroos. Since then, four more potoroos have been sent to start a breeding colony.

There is a lot of danger for the survival of Gilbert's potoroo. Because of the small area where they live, they could be lost in a bushfire. Foxes and cats could easily kill all the potoroos. There may not be enough potoroos to give them enough genetic differences to survive a virus. There is not enough natural bushland at Two Peoples Bay, and there is too much cleared land next to the nature reserve.

G-type main-sequence star

A GV star, or yellow dwarf, is a main-sequence star. It is of spectral type G and luminosity class V on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. The term "yellow dwarf" is a misnomer, because G-type stars actually range in color from white, for more luminous types like the Sun, to only very slightly yellow for the less massive and luminous G-type main-sequence stars. See spectral classification for a chart of star color by light type. 

GV stars are small (about 0.8 to 1.0 solar masses) and have a surface temperature of between 5,300 and 6,000 K. Like other main-sequence stars, a GV star turns hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion.

Our Sun is the most commonly known (and most easily seen) example of a GV star. Each second, it combines around 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium, changing about 4 million tons of matter to energy. Other GV stars include Alpha Centauri A, Tau Ceti, and 51 Pegasi.

Our own Sun looks yellow through the Earth's atmosphere due to Rayleigh scattering. Without that, it would look white. Even though the name "dwarf" is used to compare yellow main sequence stars from giant stars, yellow dwarfs like the Sun are 90% brighter than all of the stars in the Milky Way (which are largely orange dwarfs, red dwarfs, and white dwarfs).

A GV star fuses hydrogen nuclei together and release energy for around 10 billion years. After the hydrogen is used up, the star will grow to many times its earlier size and become a red giant like Aldebaran. Eventually the red giant will lose its outer layers of gas, which will become a planetary nebula, while the inside of the star (also known as the core) will cool and shrink into a small, very dense white dwarf.

Kōji Nakata

Nakata was born in Otsu on July 9, 1979. After graduating from Teikyo High School, he joined J1 League club Kashima Antlers in 1998.

The club won the champions 2008, 2009 J1 League, 2010 Emperor's Cup, 2011 and 2012 J.League Cup. He retired end of 2014 season.

Although Nakata played as defensive midfielder at the club, he played as left-back of three backs defense at U-20, U-23 and Senior national team under manager Philippe Troussier. In April 1999, Nakata played for U-20 Japan at 1999 World Youth Championship. He played all 7 matches with defender Kazuki Teshima and Shigeki Tsujimoto, and Japan won the 2nd place.

Johan Neeskens

Johan Neeskens (born 15 September 1951) is a former Dutch football player. He has played for Netherlands national team. He is considered to be one of the greatest midfielders of his generation as well as being regarded as one of the best Dutch players of all time. This is the definition that Neeskens gave for himself, which however appears too reductive. He knew how to best interpret that universality of role preached at the time in Holland: a true all-round wildcard, Neeskens was a complete and continuous player, capable of adapting to play almost anywhere on the pitch.

He possessed remarkable athletic skills thanks to which he gave support and completeness to the technical skills of his teammates. Ideal fulcrum of the midfield, with his passes and high-precision shots he enhanced the qualities of his colleagues: speed and fluidity. Neeskens perfectly expressed what Michels and Kovacs preached in the Netherlands: "a player must be complete and continuous, able to adapt to play in any area of ​​the pitch". He was also a good header and an infallible penalty taker.

His roughness came to light with the expulsion in the semi-final of the 1976 European Championships against Czechoslovakia. His determination on the pitch also made him a true leader when it was necessary to take the team by the hand in the most difficult moments of the match.

Raised in the RCH youth academy, at 19 he won his first Eredivisie with Ajax. From there the following year begins the great cycle of lancers who win three European Cups in a row. In recent years Neeskens stands out as "one of the best defenders of the Old Continent".

On the eve of the German World Cup Neeskens had signed for Barcelona, ​​yielding to the court of his old teacher Rinus Michels, anxious to reunite him and Cruyff. Upon his arrival he meets a Camp Nou saddened by the departure of the Peruvian Hugo Sotil due to the limit of foreigners in the team but Neeskens does not take long to become an idol of the Barça fans, not only for his qualities as a footballer but also for his willingness to identify with the club and with the Catalan nation. This combination makes him one of the most emblematic players in the history of the club. For him in Spain a King's Cup, a Cup Winners' Cup and 219 games with 53 goals. To remember in 1979 the spectacular final in Basel against Fortuna Düsseldorf ended 4-3 in extra time. It would have been his last match with the blaugrana shirt.

Like other great champions of his generation, in the late 1970s Neeskens continued his career in the North American league, with the NY Cosmos shirt. After the New York experience, he returns home to Groningen for a season. He returns again to the United States where he plays in the South Florida Sun, a United Soccer League team, with him he won the 1985 championship. In America he also plays in indoor soccer, playing in the KC Comets.

Finally, he returned to Europe to end his competitive career in Switzerland in 1991.

A precocious talent, he made his senior international debut at the age of 19 on 11 November 1970 against East Germany. Neeskens became a star of the international firmament in 1974, participating in the 1974 FIFA World Cup. In the first group stage he scored two goals (both from penalties) in the 4-1 win against Bulgaria; in the second group stage he scored as many goals, opening the scoring against East Germany and Brazil (both ended 2-0 for the "oranje"), ultimately being much more decisive than Johan Cruijff. This last goal, scored with a precise diagonal, was celebrated in an exuberant way by the whole Dutch team. The Netherlands thus reached the final where they faced the hosts of West Germany. It was Neeskens who scored the penalty caused by a foul of Uli Hoeneß on Cruyff, giving him the advantage in the second minute of play. Despite this episode, the match will end 2-1 for the Germans. Neeskens thus closed the world championship as top scorer of the "oranje" with 5 goals, a good booty for a midfielder. 

Two years later Neeskens took part in the 1976 European Championships, in which, however, his performance failed to reach the peaks of the previous world championship. The Netherlands qualified for the second round only thanks to the better goal difference than Poland. The match won against the Poles, finished 3-0, in which Neeskens opened the scoring was decisive. Also scoring in the 5-0 against Belgium in the quarter-finals, Neeskens will be sent off during the semi-final against Czechoslovakia for a bad reaction to a foul by Pollak, paving the way for his national team to be eliminated, defeat against the predictions of eve for 3-1. The oranjes will then win the final for third place in extra time without Neeskens and Cruijff who returned early to Barcelona.

At Argentina 1978 the Netherlands showed up without Cruijff, so it was up to Neeskens, Rensenbrink and Rep to lead the national team to the final which they lost 3-1 in extra time against the hosts. The Argentine Mundial was the end of a once-in-a-lifetime cycle for the oranje national team. Neeskens ended his career as his country's representative with a total of 49 competitive matches and scored 17 goals.

Confederation

A confederation is a group of countries that, by treaty, have given some of their powers to a central government. They do this in order to coordinate their actions in a number of areas. This is like a federation, but without the association being a new country. 

A confederation is not the same as a federation, but they have a similarity. A confederation is a group of countries, a federation is a country.

The only example today is the European Union. Switzerland still has the official Latin name "Confœderatio Helvetica", since it was founded in 1291, as a confederation. It later became a federation but kept the word "Confœderatio".

Les noces

Les Noces () is a ballet in four scenes, originally for the "Ballets Russes" of Sergei Diaghilev. The ballet was choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska and the music and words were written by Igor Stravinsky. The music is written for voices, four pianos, and percussion.

The ballet was first presented on 13 June 1923 at the Théâtre Gaîte-Lyrîqué in Paris. The ballet is sometimes called a "dance cantata", and the music is sometimes performed as a concert piece.

In 1915 ballet producer Sergei Diaghilev wanted to create a ballet called "La Liturgie". Its background would be the Greek Orthodox Church. Stravinsky was a strong Christian, and did not want to write this ballet. He turned instead to Russian folk songs for "Les Noces". He had started to think about this in 1913. Michel Fokine started the choreography but Vaslav Nijinsky took over. Leonide Massine stepped in for Nijinsky. When Massine left, Bronislava Nijinska designed the dancing.

Design for the ballet (sets and clothing) was done by Natalia Goncharova. Goncharova, an outstanding artist, made two complete designs before her third was accepted. The first two designs were rejected because they did not suit either the dancing or the musical score. The ballet, though based on a folk tale, was modernist in style: Stravinsky and Nijinska thought it was important for its design to be in sympathy with this.

The bride, Nastasia, is having her hair done. She complains that it hurts when pulled. The choir sing to her about how beautiful her life will be with her husband, Fétis. The nightingales will sing to them in the garden. The choir sings to the Virgin Mary. They sing about the husband-to-be and his fair hair. They ask for a blessing for the young couple. The actual marriage ceremony is not seen. In the last of the four scenes, we see the wedding feast. The people are happy and start to get drunk. The husband and wife are led to the bedroom.

The ballet is still in the repertoires of some major ballet companies, such as the Royal Ballet. It was performed in 1936 by Colonel de Basil's "Ballets Russes", one of the successor companies to that of Diaghilev. Its post-WWII revival in London (1966) was personally supervised by Nijinska. Because of this, the ballet is still danced to its original choreography. It was also performed at Stuttgart (1974) and Paris (1976). Jerome Robbins choreographed it in the American Ballet Theatre version of 1965.

Fort-Liberté

Fort-Liberté (Kréyòl: "Fòlibète"; English: "Fort Liberty") is a city in northeast Haiti, on the Atlantic coast. It is the capital city of the Nord-Est "Département".

The city is on the "Baie de Fort-Liberté" ("Fort-Liberté Bay") about 56 km east of Cap-Haïtien and to the west of the Dominican Republic. It is also the chief town of an "arrondissement" (a part of a department) with the same name. The "arrondissement" has three "communes" (a "commune" is like a municipality): Fort-Liberté, Ferrier (Kreyòl: "Ferye") and Perches (Kreyòl: "Opèch").

Between 1503 and 1505, Nicolás de Ovando, Spanish governor of the Hispaniola, founded the town of "Puerto Real" (English, "Royal Port") where is the present town of "Caracol", to the west of Fort-Liberté. But soon this town was abandoned and the people moved to the east, founding in 1578 a new town with the Taíno name of the region: Bayajá.

In 1606, those persons living in the old Spanish towns of Bayajá and Yaguana had, by orders of the Spanish king, to move to the eastern part of the island, to a new town called Bayaguana, combining the two old names.

Later, when French people founded a new town in this place, they called it Fort-Dauphin in 1731, named after the "Dauphin" (the "Dolphin", son of the French king Louis XV). When the French Republic was founded, the name was changed to "Fort-Liberté" in 1792. After Henri Christophe became King Henri I of Haiti in 1811, he renamed the city Fort-Royal. In 1820, after the death of Christophe, the name was changed back to Fort Liberté.

There are several forts built around the bay. An important one is "Fort Dauphin", sometimes called "Fort Saint Joseph" (Patron Saint of the city) or "Fort Liberté". Other forts in the area are "Fort de la Bouque", "Batterie de l'Anse", "Fort Saint Charles" and "Fort Saint Frédérique".

Fort-Liberté has a small port that also receives international products and serves as a fishing port. Local agricultural products include sugarcane and citrus fruits.

John Gilbert (naturalist)

John Gilbert (1812? – 28 June 1845) was an English naturalist and explorer. He collected animal specimens for English naturalist John Gould. Australia's rarest animal, Gilbert's Potoroo, "Potorous gilberti", and the Gilbert-Einasleigh River were named after him.

Gilbert was born on 14 March, but the exact year is not known. It must have been between 1810 and 1815 and so most books use 1812. Gilbert was a taxidermist for the Zoological Society of London. He met English naturalist John Gould and went to Australia in 1838 with Gould. Gould paid him £100 a year to collect and preserve animals and birds for him

Gould and Gilbert arrived in Hobart on the ship "Parsee" on 19 September 1838. They were going to collect animal and bird specimens for Gould's books. Both worked in Tasmania for a few months. On 4 February 1839, Gilbert went to the Swan River settlement. He worked there for a year, mainly around Perth, collecting for Gould. Gilbert then sailed for Sydney, and in June 1840 took a ship to Port Essington in the north of Australia. In March 1841 he sailed to Singapore, stopping at Timor on the way. From there he sailed for London and arrived at the end of September. He had collected a very large number of birds for Gould, and made many notes on their habits. 

In February 1842 Gilbert returned Australia to collect further specimens. He reached Perth in July and stayed for 17 months in Western Australia. He made his most interesting discoveries among the Wongan Hills, about 100 miles north-east of Perth. He was a fine naturalist and his notes on birds, their habits, diet, song and the names given them by the aborigines were all of great interest and value. Gilbert collected specimens of 432 birds, including 36 species new to Western Australia. He collected 318 mammals, including 22 species not previously known in the west. By the end of January 1844 he was back in Sydney and during the next six months worked his way to the Darling Downs in Queensland.

Gilbert joined Ludwig Leichhardt's expedition in September 1844 which was going to cross Australia's north, from Brisbane to Port Essington. Gilbert, with his experience in the Australian bush, was unofficially the second in charge. The journey was much slower than planned and food supplies were getting low. On 28 June 1845, near the Gulf of Carpentaria, Gilbert was killed when aborigines attacked the explorers. He was buried at the site, but the grave has never been found. The rest of the group reached Port Essington in December 1845.

Leichhardt kept Gilbert's papers and his diary, which, however, was lost for nearly 100 years before its discovery by A. H. Chisholm. Chisholm's research showed Gilbert as a man of much ability and fine character who somewhat ironically had a great respect for the aboriginals. There is a memorial to him in St James church, Sydney with the Latin phrase "Dulce et decorum est pro scientia mori" - "it is sweet and fitting to die for science."

Turbojet

A turbojet is a kind of jet engine that works by squeezing air into a small space, mixing it with fuel, and setting it on fire. The mixture of fuel and air goes out the back of the engine and pushes it forward. As it leaves the engine it spins a turbine which turns a gas compressor at the front which sucks in more air and compresses it. 

Turbofan engines are more complex. They are more common today because they can make more power, for the same amount of fuel, than a turbojet. They also make less noise. Supersonic aircraft still use the simpler kind.

2001 Bangladesh–India border clashes

Minicoy Island

Minicoy Island or Maliku (Mahal language: މަލިކު, məliku) is the only inhabited island of the Maliku Atoll. The locals, the "Malikun", call their island "Maliku," as do the Maldivians, the closest Maldive island to Minicoy is Thuraakunu. Since 1956, the Indian Government has forbidden contact between people of the same nationals of the two islands despite their geographic proximity and ethnographic similarities. The cultural traits of Minicoy differ from those of any other Indian islands of Lakshadweep. Manners, customs and food are similar to those of the Maldives to the south of Minicoy and Mahl, a dialect of Dhivehi, is the language spoken on the island. This language employs the Tāna script, written from right to left. Minicoy Islanders, like the close islands of the Maldives follow Sunni Islam. The islands were probably Buddhist before like they were in the Maldives. In August 1947 the possessions of the Emperor of British India passed to either the Indian Union or Pakistan according to an agreed demarcation line. The rulers of the independent countries that were vassals of the Emperor had the choice of acceding to either the Dominion of India or Pakistan.

While Maliku was a sovereign possession of the Emperor and not that of an independent country such as, Kashmir or Hyderabad State, it is unclear why India felt it necessary to hold a plebiscite in Maliku in 1956 to determine whether or not the people of Maliku wished to join the Indian Union. However Since 1965 Pakistan wished Maliku to return to the Republic of Maldives.

Vasopressin

Vasopressin (ADH, AVP) is the hormone which controls the production of urine in the bladder. It is secreted by the pituitary gland based on the salt concentration of the blood. It is negative feedback: the more concentrated the salt in the blood is, the more vasopressin is secreted, which in turn makes the kidney tubules more permeable, allowing more water to be reabsorbed into the blood and creating less, but more concentrated, urine. It also triggers feelings of thirst.

Razakars was the name given to a paramilitary force organized by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The word, originating from Persian, literally means "volunteer". It was composed of mostly pro-Pakistani Bengalis and Urdu-speaking migrants of the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Initially, the force was under the command of local pro-Pakistani committees. But through the East Pakistan Razakar Ordinance (promulgated by General Tikka Khan on 1 June, 1971) and a Ministry of Defence, Pakistan, ordinance (promulaged 7 September,1971), Razakars were recognized as members of the Pakistan Army.

Qasim Razvi

Syed Kasim Razvi (17 July 1902 – 15 January 1970), also Qasim Razvi, was the leader of a local militia in India, the Razakars of Hyderabad State, who blocked accession into the Republic of India after the Partition of British Indian empire against the wishes of the local majority Hindu-population, and fought against the Indian forces during occupation.

Razvi held views that Hyderabad should eventually join Pakistan in a major war against Bharat, as clearly evidenced by some of his speeches and publications in Hyderabadi newspapers. Razvi was politically powerful and a close advisor of the Nizam, whom he encouraged to defy the infidel government, and blocked the invasion of Hyderabad into Republic of India. At the height of the crisis, Razvi had placed his allies in influential posts, and was virtually dictating the Nizam's policy on the issue. Razvi even traveled to Delhi and had a stormy meeting with Indian leader Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. He is quoted to have said "Death with the sword in hand, is always preferable to extinction by a mere stroke of the pen. "prompting the Indian government to call him the "Nizam's Frankenstein monster."

After Indian military intervention, Razvi was placed under house arrest and tried under Indian laws on seditious activities and inciting communal violence. He was released in the 1950s, and he later fled to Pakistan.

Razakars (Hyderabad)

Razakars were private militia organized by Qasim Razvi which supporter the rule of Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII and resist the integration of Hyderabad State into India. 
Eventually, the Indian army routed the Razakars and the group was disbanded after India annexed the state.

Qasim Razvi, the military chief of Hyderabad State, fled to Pakistan where he was granted asylum. Majlis, a contemporary political party in the present Hyderabad owes its foundations to Qasim Razvi.

Razakar literally means "volunteer". There were types of Razakars: muslim Razakar,Hindu razakar, Reddy razakar and congress Razakars. 

Quoting an article of K F Rustomjee, the former DGP of Maharashtra and BSF, "Captain Panduranga Reddy" said that the policemen from Akola district in then Central Province were sent in to Hyderabad state in the garb of Razakars to create turmoil and blame the Nizam government. Rustomjee was SP of Akola at the time. Captain Reddy called the Communists as traitors, who encouraged violence to spread their agenda.


Al-Shams (East Pakistan)

Al-Shams () was a militia force formed in East Pakistan in early 1971 by the Pakistan Army.

Al-Shams is an Arabic word meaning 'The Sun'. Al Shams was Pakistani armed groups formed by the Pakistan Army to fight out and resist Mukti Bahini and support the army in its campaigns in the former East Pakistan provincial region.


Al-Badr (East Pakistan)

Al-Badar (আল বদর) was a paramilitary force formed in East Pakistan in 1971 by the national Pakistan Army.

Al-Badar means The Battlefield of Badar. The politics of the force were intermingled with jihad, the religious war or holy war of Muhammad 1400 years earlier. However, the war between Pakistan and Bengali separatists was a nationalistic war, not a religious one.

On March 27, 1971, after beginning the Pakistani Civil War, Pakistani military forces needed military support from Bengali nationalists supporters who still wanted to be part of Pakistan, or did not like Indian involvement in the movement; as well as the non-Bengali muhajirs in order to abolish the independence fighters of Bangladesh, the Mukti Bahini, Hemayet Bahini and Kaderiya Bahini. 

The Al Badar were formed to find these independence fighters and to be guides as well as co-fighters who were familiar with the local terrain. The force was composed of madrasa students and teachers, Bengali supporters of Muslim League and Jamaat E Islami, and "muhajirs" coming from non-Bengali part of India.

There were three type of Paramilitary forces Pakistan formed,

1.Razakars: refuges who were came from other parts of India during separation of India and Pakistan, and settled in East Pakistan.

2. Al-Badar: Bengali Muslim Students from Colleges, universities and madrasah, who were loyal to Jamat-e-islami.3. Al-Shams: Bengali Madrasah Students, teachers & supporters of Islamic parties other than Jamat-E-Islami (these smaller parties included Nejam-e-Islami and various factions of Muslim League).

Al-Badar was a very organized par military force among those three forces, with their own hierarchy of organization and reporting system.

The Al Badar were given a variety of combat and non-combat tasks including:

On 16 December 1971, Pakistan unconditionally surrendered. Members of Al-Badr, along with other Razakars, Al-Shams, and Shanti Committee also surrendered to the Mitro Bahini's. As they all were Bengali it was supposed that Bangladesh would treat them as an opposition party, that is they would arrest them and treat them as prisoners of war. However most of them were tortured, killed by Mukti Bahini, or forced into exile from Bangladesh.

All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference

The All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference is a political party in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. 

In 1932 Pro-Congress Sheikh Abdullah formed Kashmir's first political party, in Srinagar, the All Jammu & Kashmir Muslim Conference, with a demand for merger of Kashmir and Jammu with British India. His party was renamed the National Conference in 1939 to suite the secular nature of Kashmiri culture. The All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, led by Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah, had a secular ideology and wished to create a secular, democratic but independent Kashmir with close ties to British India. 

When the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference was converted into a secular political party in 1939, the Muslim leaders amended the Constitution of the Muslim Conference, renamed it the All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, modified its objectives and opened its membership to all the people of the State. On 13 June 1941, the breakaway factions of the National Conference revived the Muslim Conference under the leadership of Choudry Ghualm Abbas. 

The All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference led the Muslim movement for accession into Pakistan. On July 19, 1947, a convention of All Jammu & Kashmir Muslim Conference, adopted the "Accession to Pakistan Resolution" demanding accession of the Kashmir state to Pakistan. 

Since 1948 the All-Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference has been the political party in power in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.

Cornish nationalism

The Cornish self-government movement (sometimes referred to as Cornish nationalism) is a social movement which seeks greater autonomy for Cornwall. The movement says that Cornwall is not just a county of England (which is its current status) but a duchy and a distinctive British nation which has never been formally incorporated into England by an Act of Union. Supporters of Cornish self-government who say that Cornwall is, or ought to be, a separate legal entity from England do not necessarily mean to advocate full independence from the United Kingdom. They want official recognition for Cornwall as one of the home nations of the UK.

Some supporters of Cornish self-government question the legitimacy of English rule in Cornwall, due to the failure of the Parliament of England to pass an Act of Union. Their claims are not generally recognised. Some people are supportive of the Cornish Assembly Campaign. The Cornish National Party is a social democratic political party in Cornwall to which some Cornish nationalists belong. It wanted Cornish independence from the United Kingdom. it split from Mebyon Kernow, the other Cornish political party in 1975.

Calculator

A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere. A smartphone or other computer can also act as a calculator. 

Some calculators, like the abacus, will work without electricity. Others, like the electronic calculator, use batteries. Some calculators are simple, and can only add, subtract, multiply and divide, and sometimes take square roots. Scientific calculators can do many other things, such as use exponents (or powers or indices) and trigonometry functions.

A printing calculator can print its results.

A pocket calculator is a small calculator that helps people do arithmetic. It is so small that it can be put in a pocket. Its most common use is for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Many pocket calculators are powered by solar cells. They are commonly seen in schools and businesses and can be used quickly and efficiently for simple mathematical problems. Other names are 'miniature calculator' or 'mini calculator'.

A scientific calculator can do more things. It can often use exponents (or powers or indices), pi, trigonometric ratios, and the order of operations. Scientific calculators can also use bigger numbers. They tend to cost more than pocket calculators. Many are also programmable. The user can make a program directly with the calculator, or transfer one from a computer. 

A GST calculator is a tool used to compute the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on goods or services in a given transaction. It helps individuals and businesses accurately determine the amount of GST applicable, aiding in financial planning, budgeting, and compliance with tax regulations.

ITV Yorkshire

ITV Yorkshire (originally Yorkshire Television) is an ITV franchise based in Leeds. ITV Yorkshire broadcasts to Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. ITV Yorkshire has made successful programmes such as Emmerdale, Heartbeat, The Beiderbecke Trilogy, Rising Damp, Harry's Game, The Darling Buds of May, Only When I Laugh and Duty Free. Yorkshire Television also produces the Calander news programme.

The headquarters of ITV Yorkshire are at The Leeds Studios in the Burley area of Leeds.

For almost 35 years, Yorkshire Television's on-screen identity always revolved around the use of the station logo: the chevron. This yellow symbol was seen on nearly all of Yorkshire Television's idents and presentation. The first symbol used was a black and white chevron, formed by slit-scan techniques and accompanied by an orchestral version of the tune "On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at", a famous Yorkshire folk song. This music was later to become the station's jingle. This ident continued until Yorkshire Television officially commenced their colour broadcasts in November 1969.

The new colour ident featured the yellow chevron on a black background with the still caption card "Yorkshire Television Colour Production", along with a simplified version of "On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at". This ident was modified in 1981, so that the caption "Colour Production" was changed to "In Colour", and in 1982 the colour caption was removed altogether. The new version of the jingle was at a lower pitch than was previously composed.

Supplementing the ident throughout this period were idents promoting the station's coverage, with the slogan ""Serving Six Million Viewers"". One version, in 1983 featured a giant chevron logo, made up out of smaller chevrons, and another in 1986 featured the view zooming in from space, to the Yorkshire TV region, which then flipped over, becoming the chevron. This last version was computer animated, with 3D-style lettering and chevron.

On 5 January 1987, Yorkshire Television introduced a new ident, entitled "Liquid Gold", featuring a pool of liquified gold, with the chevron rising up from it, and rotating into the sky, where the station name joins it. This ident features a fully orchestrated version of the theme tune and reportedly cost £40,000 to make. This was occasionally supplemented by a large rotating chevron over a gradient-ed blue background, used over continuity.

On 1 September 1989, Yorkshire Television adopted the first ITV generic look, featuring the large ITV logo, addition ident was also used where a static chevron on the same background as the main ident. On 7 January 1991, the ident was revised to allow the Chevron to appear full screen instead of being a segment of the 'V' which the company used until 23 October 1994. The whole package was used by Yorkshire Television, and an adapted version, where the whole chevron appeared in the V segment before moving into centre screen, was used before regional programming.

Upon YTV ending their use of the ITV generic look on 24 October 1994, a new ident was introduced, featuring a textured background with a central strip containing images of the region itself, with the chevron placed in the centre of said strip. The most noticeable thing about this ident set was the smooth nature of the chevron's appearance and, like the previous look, did not feature the ""On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at" "jingle, instead favouring a smooth orchestral jingle. The background was later changed from a cream to a light blue, and variations on the theme for special occasions and yearly themes were also introduced.

Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television adopted a new branding package, based on the concept of Channel 3. The new look was fully implemented in the Tyne Tees region on 2 September 1996, where all on-screen branding was replaced by giant numeral '3', and the Tyne Tees brand became secondary to 'Channel 3 North East, however the look was only partially implemented in the Yorkshire region a month after Tyne Tees's revamp. The entirety of Yorkshire's Channel 3 look included an ident which was later introduced on 4 November 1996 at the same year, where the chevron span against a light blue background with numeral '3's covering the background. Another ident featured the chevron with the '3' numeral embossed on the side, which would zoom into view, before revealing a spinning numeral 3, which in turn had YTV chevron on the middle of the 3 and when zoomed into, the chevron re-appeared spinning against the background. The look also heralded the return of the "On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at" tune, which was now noticeably higher in pitch.

The Channel 3 look was dropped on 9 March 1998, following Granada's acquisition of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, with the look returning to a spinning chevron against a misty blue background, light blue during the day and dark blue in the evenings.

On 8 November 1999, Yorkshire Television adopted the second generic look, based on the theme of hearts, which was used for the entirety of the branding period before network programming. However, for local programming, Yorkshire created their own ident featuring a background of spinning chevrons, with pictures of the region featuring inside a central box.

On 28 October 2002, the brand was dropped in favour of a national ITV1 identity, in which local regional identities were dropped except before local programming, when the Yorkshire name appeared below the ITV1 logo only. These regional idents however were dropped by 2006.

Sojourner Truth

Sojourner Truth (about 1797 – November 26, 1883) was one of the first abolitionists and activists for women's rights. She was born as a slave, but escaped from slavery in 1826. She was born Isabella Baumfree, but renamed herself to 'Sojourner Truth' when she was 46 and announced she would travel to work against injustice.The name Sojourner Truth translates as itinerant preacher. She is one of the most widely known African American women of the 19 century. Her freedom was linked with the passage of a New-York State Law in 1799 that began the process of gradual emancipation.

She lectured widely on the cruelties she had experienced as a slave. She is best known for her "Ain't I a Woman?" speech, given at the Woman's Rights Convention of 1851. She also gave out speeches about abolishing slavery. Also, she became active in the Underground Railroad, helping blacks escape to freedom. She could only speak Dutch and at a young age soon learnt English. Sadly, she was beaten for not understanding the commands of her owners John and Sally Dumont. There is evidence that John beat her and Sally sexually abused her. 

Isabella Baumfree (Sojourner Truth) was born into slavery around 1797 in Swartekill, New York. Sojourner was the daughter of James Baumfree and Elizabeth Baumfree. Her family’s slave owner was Colonel Hardenbergh. Sojourner was born a slave and did not know how to read or write because nobody taught slaves how to. Out of 13 children, she was the youngest. In the first three decades of her life she was the property of five owners.It is In 1815 she dated fellow slave Thomas. Together they had 3 children. Her family was separated in 1806. In 1826 Isabella escaped to freedom with her infant daughter. Sojourner changed her name in 1843 from Isabella Baumfree to Sojourner Truth. She married and bore five children although only four of their names are known. She never learned to read or write and depended on others to take down her words while handling her correspondences. 

Sojourner was the first African American to win a trial against a white man. This trial was about getting her son Peter back. This was a great accomplishment for African Americans. During the Civil War Belle told the people about the Woman's Right to vote and became friends with some other people, which one of them threaten that she would not support the issue.She campaigned for Republican Ulysses S. Grant. She was one of the prominent Americans that attempted to vote in the 1872 election but was refused the right to. She went on to support herself by selling copies of her book, “The Narrative of Sojourner Truth “. During that time, she was a Battle Creek resident and property owner. She spent the last few years of her life and died in Battle Creek, Michigan on November 26, 1883. 

Quinkana

Quinkana is an extinct genus of large land crocodile that reached up to 7 meters (23 feet) in length. It lived in Australia from 24 million years ago to 40,000 years ago.

Amaranth

Amaranth ("Amaranthus" species) is a cosmopolitan genus of herbs. About 60 species are recognized, with flower clusters and foliage ranging from purple and red to gold.

Instant Runoff Voting

Instant runoff voting is a method of electing one political candidate to office from a list of more than two, but it can also be used for other group decisions. Voters rank the candidates from favorite to least favorite, with only their top choices being counted each time. Ballots are counted, and a series of simulated rounds is conducted. If no candidate has a majority of the votes in any round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and those voters' next choice votes are then counted. This is repeated until a candidate has a majority.

Instant runoff voting has been used in Australia's lower house for more than 80 years. That house is strongly dominated by two parties. It has also been used to elect mayors in some cities in the United States. Voter turn out is typically the same as with plurality voting.

Proponents believe instant runoff voting allows them to vote for their first choice candidate and still help the lessor of evils if the first choice is eliminated. They believe Instant Runoff Voting to be the only way let voters vote their true intentions and undermine the two-party system. By having more candidates on the ballot, incumbents are more likely to be kicked out of office.

Opponents argue that if at least three candidates have a chance of winning, voting for one's favorite could cause a compromise candidate to lose in the first round. Their favorite might then lose against the least preferred candidate in the second round. Voters' votes cannot be transferred to their second choice if their second choice is eliminated before their first choice is. Voters often use their first choice vote for a compromise vote, the same as with plurality.

While theoretically simple, instant runoff voting often requires computers because the rankings on each ballot matter for determining the elimination order and can not be counted in aggregate. Opponents of Instant runoff voting often oppose computer counting of ballots, since it is difficult for ordinary citizens to count the ballots by hand and catch any fraud. The fact that a candidate has fewer votes does not mean the candidate is less popular but that the candidate was squeezed out on both sides of the political spectrum. Instant runoff voting can eliminate centrists in the last elimination.

Harrier Jump Jet

The Harrier Jump Jet, usually called the Harrier, is a British-designed military aeroplane. It was designed during the 1960s. The Harrier is well known as it can take off vertically. It can do this by changing the direction of thrust from its engines. It is sometimes called V/STOL, which means "Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing". It can carry heavier loads with a short takeoff than with a vertical one.

In 1967, the Bristol Engine Company proposed the radical idea of a directed thrust engine. Next, Hawker Aircraft designed an aeroplane that could meet the NATO specification for a "light tactical support fighter". There was no financial support for the development from HM Treasury, but support was found from NATO.

A prototype flew in 1960. Various changes were made and several preliminary versions flew including the "Kestrel" and the first Harriers flew for the RAF and Royal Navy in 1969. The planes were built in both Britain and the United States. They were redeveloped and manufactured by British Aerospace and Macdonald Douglas, companies which are now owned by BAE Systems and Boeing, respectively. At present the Boeing/BAE Systems AV-8B Harrier II is used by NATO countries such as the United States, Spain and Italy. A modified version, the BAE Systems/Boeing Harrier II is used by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy.

Between 1969 and 2003, 824 Harrier variants were delivered. Manufacture of new Harriers ended in 1997. The last remanufactured aircraft (Harrier II Plus configuration) was delivered in December 2003. This ended the Harrier production line.

The Harrier is used by many military forces. The United States Marine Corps and the Royal Air Force (RAF) use versions which are specially designed for taking off and landing on aircraft carriers. Other countries which use the Harrier include Thailand and India.

In 2006, the RAF introduced a new version of the Harrier, the GR/9. This is an updated version of the previous version, the GR/7. It has a top speed of 574 knots.

The Harrier was used a lot during the Falklands War. Harriers flew a total of 1,561 sorties, shot down 20 enemy planes (+ 3 probables) with 10 Harriers lost. Of the ten lost, six were shot down; the others were damaged in accidents on the carrier. The Sea Harriers made the Argentine Air Force much less effective than they hoped to be.

The Harrier can carry different equipment for each mission. It can carry missiles and bombs. It can also carry cameras to take pictures of the ground.

The Avro Vulcan (also Avro 698 Vulcan) is a delta wing bomber aircraft. It was part of the RAF V bombers which were used by the Royal Air Force as a nuclear deterrent during the Cold War. The other aircraft in the V bombers were the Vickers and Valiant. The Vulcan was also used for long-distance bombing runs during the Falklands War.

In 1947, the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence said it needed a bomber aircraft that could fly a long way and very high. It also needed to carry a lot of bombs. The prototype Vulcan flew in 1948. It crashed in 1949, but development carried on. Over 100 aircraft were built between 1956 and 1965.

The crew of the Vulcan was made up of five people – two pilots, two navigators and one electronics officer. The Vulcan was originally used as part of the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent. It carried the United Kingdom's first nuclear weapon, called "Blue Danube".

The Vulcan was also used sometimes for reconnaissance. It was retired from the Royal Air Force in 1984.

Barthold Fles

Barthold Fles (February 7, 1902 – December 19, 1989) was a Dutch-American who worked as a literary agent, helping writers find publishers to print their books. He also wrote books and articles, edited texts, translated books from German to English, and published poetry books.

Barthold Fles was born in Amsterdam on February 7, 1902. His family was Jewish but did not keep Jewish laws. His father, Louis Fles, thought that it was wrong for Jews and other people to be religious. Louis Fles imported typewriters and sold them, in addition to other office products, in several stores that he owned and to other stores. Barthold was his oldest son so his father wanted him to help him at work. Barthold did not want to work for his father. He only wanted to read. Barthold read in Dutch, German, English, and French. He read a lot and very fast. Barthold found a job at De Lange publishers. In 1923 he left for the United States.

In New York Fles first worked as a violinist, painting apartments, selling vacuum cleaners and for publishers. In 1933 he started his own business, a "literary agency", in Manhattan, New York. As a "literary agent" he mostly helped writers find publishers. He also sold stories for films or magazines and would find a writer to make a book that a publisher wanted. When Barthold started working as a literary agent, many of his clients were people who left Germany for the United States because of the Nazism in Germany. He held meetings for these writers in New York so that they could learn about publishing books and stories in the United States. Later, however, most of the writers he worked with were born in the United States.

In 1936 Barthold married Ruth Grünwald, a dancer at the Metropolitan Opera who had been just one year in the United States. Ruth helped Barthold with his work. Later she left him. Although he had no children of his own, Barthold Fles wrote two books for kids: "Slavonic rhapsody: the life of Antonín Dvořák" (in 1948) and "East Germany" (in 1973). He also wrote many articles and introductions to story collections. He translated three books from German to English. One of these books, Bambi's Children by Felix Salten, was also a book for children.

In 1986, when he was 84 years old, Fles stopped working. He went back to the Netherlands, and lived three years in a home for retired artists. He died on December 19, 1989 at the age of 87.




These German poetry books were published by Barthold Fles Verlag, New York

Folder (computing)

When talking about file systems, a folder (also called directory, or catalog) is a way to organize computer files. A folder is a storage space, or container, where many files can be placed into groups and organize the computer. A folder can also contain other folders. For many computer software applications, there is a current working directory. This is the folder that the application runs in. In Unix and Linux, a directory is a special type of file.

Folders can be put together to make a "filesystem" and are laid out like a tree. The folders inside folders are like branches and sub-branches off the tree trunk. This idea is used by the software to allow the user to navigate the folders. A computer file, such as a spreadsheet or music file can only be in one folder directly. This folder, however, can be inside other folders. On some operating systems, shortcuts or links can be made from one folder to another to make it appear that one file or folder is contained in two different parent folders. On Unix systems, this is called a "symbolic link", and is similar in function to a hyperlink.

Folders are inspired by a real-life item called a file folder.

Computer icon

An icon, when talked about in computing, is a picture which usually stands for a computer program, computer file, folder, or an action for a program to do. Icons are usually small pictures, but not always. Sometimes the user can change what size an icon is.

Icons are used in many places on a computer. The desktop contains icons as shortcuts - clicking on these icons opens up the file, folder, or application that they stand for. For example, in Microsoft Windows the desktop will often have an icon for the Recycle Bin, and the icon usually looks like a trash can in the dextstop.

Shortcut icons also show up in other places such as folders and the start menu. These icons work the same as on the desktop.

Many computer programs use icons on "buttons". When the user clicks on the button, something happens. For example, a button with an icon of a printer will usually help the user print what is currently open. While a button with a magnifying glass will let the user search for something.

Portulacaceae

Portulacaceae is a family of flowering plants, comprising about 20 genera with about 500 species, ranging from herbaceous plants to shrubs.

Peter Grimes

Peter Grimes is an opera by Benjamin Britten. It was first performed in 1945. It is generally thought to be the most important British opera of the 20th century. It is about a community in a small fishing village in the east of England in the 1820s. Peter Grimes is a fisherman who feels that the people do not want to have anything to do with him. He wants to make lots of money so that he can marry and get people’s respect. In his obsession with catching as much fish as possible he is cruel to the boys who help him (his apprentices), and they die. At the end of the opera Grimes drowns himself.

Britten wrote the main part (Peter Grimes) for his life partner Peter Pears to sing.

There are three acts, and the opera starts with a prologue and ends with an epilogue. Some of the scenes are joined by continuous music, and some of this is often played separately in concerts. This music is known as the Four Sea Interludes.

When World War II started Britten and Pears went to America to avoid the war. In 1941 Britten started to feel homesick because he read an article by E.M.Forster about George Crabbe, a poet who had lived in the same part of England that Britten came from. Britten started to realize that, in order to compose well, he had to go back to his own country. Britten and Pears returned to England in 1942.

The conductor Sergei Koussevitzky asked Britten to write an opera based on a poem by George Crabbe. The poem, called “The Borough”, was about the story of Peter Grimes. The village in the poem was fictitious, but it was very much like Aldeburgh where Britten later made his home. Britten asked Montagu Slater to write the libretto based on the story of Crabbe’s poem.

The opera was first performed at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London on 7 June 1945 by the company which later became English National Opera. The conductor was Reginald Goodall. Pears sang the title role.

The first American performance was in 1946 at Tanglewood conducted by Koussevitzky's pupil, Leonard Bernstein. Britten dedicated it to Koussevitsky’s wife.

The first young boy who was an apprentice to Peter Grimes has already been killed. He was at sea for three days without water to drink. An inquest is being held to decide whether Grimes is guilty of the boy’s death. The people all seem to think he is guilty. The judge decides that the boy’s death was an accident. However, he says to Grimes that he should not get another apprentice. Grimes is very angry at being told this. Ellen Orford, a school teacher, comforts him. In their beautiful duet Ellen and Peter sing at first in different keys, but finally sing together in the same key.

The scenery shows the Moot Hall, the Boar Inn (the village pub) and the church. People are saying “Good morning” to one another, especially the Slave Master who says it many times. The fishermen start work mending their nets. Keene tells Grimes that he has found another apprentice for him. He is a poor boy who lives in the workhouse. Nobody wants Grimes to have another apprentice. Hobson, the cart man, refuses to fetch him. But Ellen supports Peter. She sings to the crowd: “Let her among you without fault cast the first stone” (meaning: “You all have faults so do not criticize”). Hobson goes off to get the boy. A terrible storm is coming.

The scene now changes to The Boar Inn. It is very noisy inside. Bob Boles gets drunk and wants to make love to the landlady’s nieces. The storm is still raging outside. Grimes comes in. People are shocked, but Grimes does not notice. He sings and song about human fate: “Now the Great Bear and Pleiades”. The tune is in the orchestra in canon while Grimes sings very simple lines of music. People are embarrassed, so they start to sing a round: “Old Joe has gone fishing”. It has three tunes and has seven counts in a bar. The boy is brought in and Grimes takes him off in spite of the storm.
The opening of the next act is peaceful. It is Sunday morning. People are in church, and now again we hear the singing coming from the church. Ellen talks to the boy. She is horrified to see he has a bruise on his neck. Grimes says it was an accident. He gets annoyed that Ellen is worried about the boy and runs off with him. The people of the village have noticed and march up to Grimes’s hut. The scene ends with a peaceful contrast: a duet sung by the two nieces.

The orchestra play a beautiful passacaglia which links to the next scene. Grimes is accusing the boy of “telling stories”. Then he starts to feels guilty about the first boy’s death. He hears the villagers coming and tells the boy they have to go fishing. He pushes him out onto the rocks and the boy falls to his death. When the villagers arrive at the hut they find it empty.

Act 3 opens with music describing moonlight at night. People are dancing in the Moot Hall. People are very merry. Mrs. Sedley tries to tell people that Grimes is a murderer, but they do not listen. People then start to leave, saying “Goodnight” to one another (especially the Rector). Balstrode is walking with Ellen. He tells her that Grimes’s boat is in, but Grimes cannot be found. A boy’s jersey has been washed up on the shore. Ellen sings an aria “Embroidery in childhood was a luxury of idleness”. It is a moment of stillness in the drama.

A short interlude based on one chord leads to the next scene in which people are looking for Grimes. Grimes drags himself onto the shore. He seems to have gone mad. We hear a foghorn (played by an off-stage tuba) as he sings. Balstrode tells Grimes that he should go out to sea in his boat and sink it.

The opera ends with an epilogue in which the scene is the same as the beginning of the opera. Someone says that a boat has been seen sinking out to sea, but no one is interested. The people have forgotten Grimes, and continue their lives without him.

Tanggula Railway Station

Tanggula railway station is a railway station on the Qingzang railway in Tibet. It is in Amdo County. Tibet is currently an Autonomous Region inside China. At an altitude of 5,068 meters above sea level it is said to be the highest train station in the world. The next higher station outside China was Ticlio station in (Peru), at 4,829 m.

In 2009, the station was closed, but there are plans to make special trains for tourists stop there.

Tanggula railway station is less than one kilometre from Tanggula Pass which is the highest point of the Qingzang railway. That point is 5,072 meters above sea level. 

There are no staff at the station, which opened for service on July 1, 2006. Some say that the railway was built to help China control the people of Tibet.

There are three railway tracks at the station. Two of them can be accessed by a platform. The platforms are 1.25km long. The place where the station was built was specially selected for the view it offers. 

In 2008, Tangula Railtours will launch a tourist train service from Beijing to Lhasa through the pass. Three specially-built luxury trains will be used for the service.

Harry Patch

Henry "Harry" Patch (born 17 June 1898 - 25 July 2009) was a World War I veteran and the last soldier of the war to die who fought in the trenches.

Patch fought in the trenches in World War I. He became a plumber and firefighter. He never talked to anybody about his experiences in the trenches. When he was 100 years old he decided he should tell people about what he had seen in the war. He still had 11 more years to live after that. When he died at the age of 111 he was the last British person who had fought in the First World War. This is why he was known as "the Last Tommy". For the last seven days of his life he was the oldest man in Europe. He did not want to have a state funeral. The funeral was at Wells Cathedral. A very large number of people came. They were mostly ordinary people, but there were also some important people including Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. For many of the people there it was a last opportunity to pay respects to the people who fought in the war.

Harry decided to talk about his experiences because he wanted everyone to realize how terrible wars are. When he talked to the BBC he said: "...if any man tells you he went over the top and he wasn't scared, he's a damn liar." In the same series, he talked about his friends who were killed, and about the moment when he came face to face with a German soldier. He remembered the Bible story about Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with God's commandment, 'thou shalt not kill'. He could not bring himself to kill the German. Instead, he shot him in the shoulder, which made him drop his rifle. But the German carried on running towards Patch's gun, so he then shot him above the knee, and in the ankle. Patch said, "I had about five seconds to make the decision. I brought him down, but I didn't kill him."

Patch was born and died in Somerset. In his last years he lived in a nursing home in Wells where he died on 25 July 2009 from natural causes, he was 111 years old. He died just seven days after the death of Henry Allingham, aged 113, who had been the only other remaining British-resident First World War veteran. Harry Patch received eight medals.

Tommy Atkins

French and Commonwealth troops would also call British soldiers "Tommies".

Harry Patch, who died aged 111 on 25 July 2009 was known as the "Last Tommy" because he was the last surviving British soldier who fought in World War I.

Henry Allingham

Henry Allingham (born London, 6 June 1896 - 18 July 2009) was a British supercentenarian and a First World War veteran. He was an engineer for most of his life. For the last month of his life he was the oldest living man in the world (according to official records). He became the oldest man ever in Britain.

Allingham was born on 6 June 1896 in Clapton, London, England. Henry went to a London County Council school and then the Regent Street Polytechnic. Allingham remembered seeing the City Imperial Volunteers return from the Second Boer War, and watching W. G. Grace play cricket. He Joined the Royal Naval Air Service in 1915. He became an Air Mechanic First Class. Most of his life he was an engineer. He designed new car bodies for the Ford Motor Company in Dagenham.

Allingham was the oldest ever member of any of the British Armed Forces and the oldest veteran of the First World War. He was the last survivor of the Battle of Jutland, the last surviving member of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and the last surviving founding member of the Royal Air Force. He was a member of the World War One Veterans' Association. 

Between his 110th and 111th birthdays Allingham made over 60 public appearances, including a visit to The Oval on 5 June 2007 (the day before his 111th birthday), where he was wheeled around the boundary in front of the spectators. James Sisnett later surpassed Allingham's record and later became the second oldest man in the world. 

With the help of Denis Goodwin, he wrote a book about his life. It was published on 23 September 2008. 

Allingham planned to leave his body to medical science. Allingham said that Denis Goodwin persuaded him to change his mind, because he had become a symbol of the war. So he had a funeral and cremation.

Henry Allingham had four medals, two of which were from the First World War.

Allingham died on 18 July 2009 in his home in Ovingdean, East Sussex from natural causes, aged 113. A funeral service was held for Allingham at the San Nicolas Church. 

The BBC asked Carol Ann Duffy, the Poet laureate, to write a poem to mark the deaths of Allingham and Harry Patch (who died one week after Allingham on 25 July 2009).

A plaque was placed next to Allingham's home to honor his longevity record in Ovingdean, West Sussex. 

Milgram experiment

The Milgram experiment is the name for a number of controversial experiments in psychology. They were done by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. Milgram wanted to find out how easy it was to get someone to follow orders, even if the orders went against their conscience. In his experiment, a test subject was ordered by a scientist to inflict electric shocks on another person, though the shocks were faked.

To his surprise, most subjects did as they were told until the very end of the experiment, though many found it difficult. There have been many repetitions and variations of the experiment, with similar results.
Participants were told they would be helping out in a "learning experiment". The participant played the role of a "teacher" in which they had to ask questions to the "learner". Every time the learner got a question wrong or failed to answer, the teacher had to press a switch to give the learner an electric shock. The voltage increased each time. In the original version of the experiment, the teacher and learner were in separate rooms, but could talk to each other through the wall.

In fact, the electric shocks were faked. The "learners" were actually actors, who only pretended to be in pain. As the "shocks" increased, their cries of pain grew louder. They protested, banged the wall and stopped answering the questions. The shocks eventually reached levels that would have been deadly had they been real. At this point, the learner fell silent.

Much was done to trick the subjects into thinking it was real. When they arrived, they were told that the actor was another volunteer and that the "teacher" and "learner" roles would be decided at random by drawing slips of paper. In fact, both slips of paper said "teacher", so the actor pretended to have picked "learner". The electric shock machine made buzzing noises and could give an actual mild shock of 45 volts. The teacher would try this out before the experiment began.

If at any time the subject ("teacher") wanted to stop the experiment, the experimenter had instructions on what to say to them. These were known as "verbal prods". The prods the experimenter had to use were, in this order:
There were a few other things the experimenter was allowed to say. For example, if the subject asked about whether the learner would be badly hurt, the experimenter could say "Although the shocks may be painful, there is no permanent tissue damage, so please go on."

If the subject still wished to stop after the four main prods had been used, the experiment was halted. Otherwise, it was halted after the subject had given the maximum "450-volt" shock three times in succession.

Before Milgram did his experiment, he asked fourteen Yale University psychology students what they thought the results would be. On average, the students thought that 1.2% of the "teachers" would give the biggest electric shock of 450 volts. In fact, in Milgram's first set of experiments, "65 percent" (26 of 40) of participants gave the final massive 450-volt shock, and all gave a shock of at least 300 volts.

Milgram found that the "teachers" showed signs of stress and nervousness in the experiment. Signs of this included sweating, trembling, stuttering and groaning. All of them stopped to question the experiment at some point. Most continued once they were reassured by the experimenter.

Other psychologists did their own versions of Milgram's experiment and found very similar results.

After repeating the original experiment, Milgram and other scientists tried different variations. These included:

Milgram wrote about the experiment in his book "Obedience to Authority: an experimental view". It was published in 1974. Milgram offered two theories:
Other factors might partly explain the Milgram experiments:

Some researchers argued that the experiments do not fully answer the question as to why apparently normal people commit atrocities in wartime. For example, the subjects were being told that the shocks would cause no major harm to the learner, whereas those who caused events like the Holocaust knew full well that they were committing murder.

The experiment has been mentioned numerous times in pop culture. In the graphic novel "V for Vendetta" Dr. Surridge said that she lost faith in humanity because of the experiment. In 2013 there was a conference about it at Nipissing University in Canada. The Milgram effect was mentioned in the movie "" in passing,

Page-boy

A page or page boy is a young male servant. A different meaning of "page boy", but based on the same idea of one who serves, is for a young boy who helps the bride at a wedding.

In medieval times, a page was a servant to a knight. He had to clean things, help the knight, for example by running messages for him. He also learned how to fight. When he was 14 he usually became a squire. When he was 21 he sometimes became a knight.

During the Renaissance and after it became fashionable for black boys and young men to be decorative pages. They wore fancy costumes and served fashionable ladies and lords. This custom of having an "African page" lasted for several centuries. This type of page is almost unheard of today. 

Gambit

A gambit is a chess opening involving a sacrifice, usually a pawn. The player, usually White, sacrifices (gives away) a pawn or more to develop faster and get an attack against the king. Gambits are also used to control the center of the chess board for better development of pieces. The player who plays the Gambit hopes for a development advantage against the opponent. There are a few gambits that require more valuable pieces for a better chance of winning. An example:

In modern times gambits are usually not for direct attacks on the king. They aim at 'positional' advantages, such as freer play for the pieces. A well-known example is the Benko Gambit: 

In return for his pawn, Black gets open lines for his bishops and his rook on a8.

Carlos Clos Gómez

Carlos Clos Gomez is a football referee from Zaragoza, Spain. He is a UEFA class 2 referee as of January 2009.

Clos Gomez refereed a Europa League match between Motherwell F.C. and Steaua Bucharest in which he was criticised by Motherwell manager Jim Gannon.

In 2008, Clos Gomez was forced to abandon a match between Real Betis and Atletico Bilbao after a player was struck by a bottle thrown from the crowd.

On 13th March 2010, FC Barcelona's coach Josep Guardiola accused Clos Gomez of lying on the final report.

Free fall

Free fall is what happens when an object is let to fall on its own without propulsion or resistance. Someone who is standing is not in free fall, but someone jumping from an aeroplane is, until air resistance builds up, ending in terminal velocity. An artillery shell is in free fall from the time it is fired until it hits something. Even the time when it is going up is free fall. Space stations and spacecraft are in free fall when their engine is not on and they are not sitting somewhere, which means all or most of the time. For Earth the acceleration due to gravity (g) is 9.81 Newton (unit) per kilogram.

Essjay controversy

The Essjay controversy is about a well known Wikipedia administrator and salaried Wikia worker, Essjay, who later said he was Ryan Jordan.

In February 2007, Essjay was discovered to have made false claims about his school certificates and job experiences on his Wikipedia user page and to news reporter Stacy Schiff during a report for "The New Yorker".

Many people reacted in many ways to the controversy. Many articles and comments were made in electronic, print, and broadcast media; the Wikipedia community checked Essjay's article changes to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project's handling of personal identification. In his activities as an editor, Essjay had spent less time changing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes.

Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales supported Essjay's use of an identity, saying, "I regard it as a pseudonym and I don’t really have a problem with it." Later Wales changed his opinion and asked for Essjay to quit his jobs with Wikipedia and Wikia. Wales stated that he withdrew his support when he learned "that EssJay used his false credentials in content disputes" on Wikipedia.

Stacy Schiff, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter writing for "The New Yorker", interviewed Essjay as a source for an article about Wikipedia. ("Know It All"; July 31, 2006) He was suggested for this to her by a member of the Wikimedia Foundation. "The New Yorker", said Essjay "was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page."

During the interview, Jordan told "The New Yorker" and had said on his Wikipedia user page that he had doctoral degrees in theology and canon law. He also said he worked as a tenured professor at a private university. It was later found that he was 24 years old and had quit community college with no qualifications. "The New Yorker" published a correction in February 2007, which brought the issue to broader public attention.

The article said that Essjay was on Wikipedia some 14 hours or more a day. The article also said he was careful to keep his online life a secret from his co-workers and friends. Essjay was pictured as taking his laptop to class so he could be available to other Wikipedians while giving a quiz. He said that he needed anonymity to avoid cyberstalking.

Essjay said that he had sent an email to a college professor using his false persona's credentials, telling for Wikipedia's accuracy. In the message he wrote in part, "I am an administrator of the online encyclopedia project Wikipedia. I am also a tenured professor of theology; feel free to have a look at my Wikipedia userpage (linked below) to gain an idea of my background and credentials."

When Essjay was hired by Wikia in January 2007, he made changes to his Wikia profile and "came clean on who he really was," showing himself as Ryan Jordan. Other Wikipedia editors asked Essjay questions on his Wikipedia talk page about the difference between his new Wikia profile and his previously claimed credentials. Essjay posted a reason in response to the first question, saying that:

He later said on his Wikipedia user page about having fooled Schiff by "doing a good job playing the part."

Social activist and Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt then told "The New Yorker" about the difference in profiles. In late February 2007 the magazine updated its article with a change (correction) saying that "Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan, that he is twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees, and that he has never taught."

On March 3, 2007, Andrew Lih, Assistant Professor and Director of Technology Journalism and of the Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong, said on his blog that a part of Essjay's comments on the incident entered "the dangerous domain of defamation and libel" against Stacy Schiff. Lih quoted Essjay as writing on his Wikipedia talk page: "Further, she [Schiff] made several offers to compensate me for my time, and my response was that if she truly felt the need to do so, she should donate to the Foundation instead." Lih noted:

Lih wrote that he contacted Schiff for comment about whether she had offered to pay Essjay for his time and quoted her return email. In it Schiff said that Essjay's statement was "complete nonsense."

Talking about Jordan, Wales said, "Mr. Ryan was a friend, and still is a friend. He is a young man, and he has offered me a heartfelt personal apology, which I have accepted. I hope the world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation".
Essjay had said in reply at the time with a statement on his Wikipedia page, in part saying:

Reaction from inside the Wikipedia community to the Essjay/Jordan identity difference was pointed. There were many comments. While most editors opposed at least some of his actions, responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud.

As the controversy went further, the Wikipedia community began looking at Essjay's previous changes. Some felt he had relied upon his false professorship to prove he was right about his changes. "People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments," said Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator and founder of the Wikipedia community newspaper, "The Wikipedia Signpost". "Those will get looked at again." For instance, Essjay had recommended sources such as "Catholicism for Dummies," a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church. Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur: "This is a text I often require for my students, and I would hang my own PhD on it’s credibility."
Wales was "...reported to be considering vetting all persons who adjudicate on factual disputes." "I don't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia, but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address," Wales added. He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished. "We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition, so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle", Wales commented. However, he also warned that "It's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials, and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate". Wales argued "contributors to the site who claim certain credentials will soon have to prove they really have them." However, Florence Devouard, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, was not supportive of his credential suggestion, saying, "I think what matters is the quality of the content, which we can improve by enforcing policies such as 'cite your source,' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor." A formal suggestion that users saying to have qualification would have to give something to prove they really do have them, before using them was rejected by the Wikipedia community, like all previous such suggestions.

As a follow-up to his first comments to "The New Yorker", Wales wrote this apology to the magazine, which showed in its March 19, 2007 issue:

Wales stated his regret that Essjay had "made a series of very bad judgments." He said he hopes the Wkipedia would be better off from the controversy.

Andrew Orlowski, a Wikipedia critic and writer for "The Register"—a British technology news and opinion website—criticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the venture-capital-funded 'Wikia' and for making him a member on the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee. Essjay had admitted his stated academic and professional credentials were false before he was made a member. Orlowski added that Essjay's actions showed a harmful community way of thinking inside Wikipedia.

Others to comment negatively included ZDNet writer Mitch Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe asked "why lying about one's background qualifies a person to work for a company like Wikia, which proposes to help communities to record accurate information" and asked for additional details "such as when he fired Jordan and the reasons for the firing, as well as when he endorsed Jordan in public statements."

Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief of online encyclopedia Citizendium, and a co-founder of Wikipedia who quit the project in 2002, called Essjay's response "a defiant non-apology" and elsewhere stated Essjay's actions as "identity fraud."
Showing comments by Essjay on his Wikipedia talk pages, Sanger stated that other members of Wikipedia management, including Angela Beesley (co-founder of Wikia and a member of Wikimedia Foundation's Communications Committee) and Brad Patrick (legal counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation) had worked in hiring Jordan when they knew of the identity difference. Sanger also made note that Jordan's dismissal was the result of public response. That "Only after these sad facts were publicly made aware, only after there was a response, did Jimmy Wales decide to ask for Essjay’s to quit."

Other comments:

Following the media broadcast of the Essjay controversy, a number of people noted the damage to the credibility of Wikipedia. On March 2, 2007, a report in "The Chronicle of Higher Education" commented "the incident is clearly damaging to Wikipedia's credibility—especially with professors who will now note that one of the site's most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud." Ross Brann, a professor of Judeo-Islamic classes at Cornell University in Ithaca, stated that Wikipedia is without a way to expertly review, saying, "They could make up your life if they wanted to." Brann also said that Wikipedia "has no place in the University," and he believed the Essjay incident would do nothing to change the negative opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia. Students at Cornell stated that they may continue to use Wikipedia as a quick source of information, though they would not cite it in scholarly work.

Cernunnos

Cernunnos (also spelt as Cernenus and Cern) is a Pagan Celtic God from the ancient Celtic lands of western Europe.

Cernunnos is linked with male animals with horns, especially stags (a type of animal). Because of this, he is linked with fertility. Cernunnos is also seen as God of the Underworld.

Everything that we know about Cernunnos comes from two pictures; one from France, and one from Germany.

Gameplay of Pokémon

The gameplay of the Pokémon series of role-playing video games involves catching and training fictional creatures called "Pokémon" and using them to battle other trainers. Every generation of games follows this concept by introducing new Pokémon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere before being introduced in the games; double battles appeared in the anime long before appearing in the games, and Pokémon abilities are similar to the Pokémon Powers introduced in the "Pokémon Trading Card Game".

Battling is a large part of the games. Pokémon can be found in the wild, in dark grass, caves, forests, ponds, the ocean, and even underwater. Whenever the player walks where another trainer can see them, the two must battle. Hundreds of trainers are in each of the main series "Pokémon" games.

Pokémon have six statistics (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) which affect how they perform in battles. Statistics can be raised by using items and by training the Pokémon.

Before "Pokémon Gold and Silver" were released, the "Special Attack" and "Special Defense" stats were combined into one statistic, "Special." This became too complicated so it was divided into "Special Attack" and "Special Defense."

Starting in "Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire", Pokémon have abilities which affect them in various ways. These can be abilities that work while in battle or when the player is just walking around. An example is the ability "Overgrow" which increases the power of Grass-type moves when a Pokémon's health is below 1/3 of its full amount.
Each Pokémon has either one or two types. Which types it has affect how it performs when it battles other Pokémon of other types. For example, a Fire-type Pokémon is weak against Water-type, but is strong against a Grass-type. It could be compared to a more complex game of rock, paper, scissors.

This is a list of the types:

Two more were added when "Pokémon Gold and Silver" were released:

Another type, "Fairy", was added in "Pokémon X and Y".

Pokémon Gyms are buildings where the player faces a Gym Leader, who focuses one of the 18 types of Pokémon. There are also trainers in the Gym that the player can battle, and they also use mostly that type. Beating the Gym Leader earns you a Badge which increases your skills.

Pokémon evolve into different Pokémon from the same evolutionary line. Doing so, they become stronger and can learn more powerful moves, but learn moves at higher levels.

This is the most common way that Pokémon evolve. Pokémon in this category evolve when they reach a certain level. 
Some Pokémon can only evolve by level in a certain place.
Some Pokémon evolve by level if it is holding a certain item.
Some Pokemon only evolve by level if they are leveled in a route that is having certain weather. This weather can only work to evolve the Pokemon if the weather is not caused by a move or Ability.

This is another way that Pokémon evolve. Some Pokémon can only evolve if they are given certain evolution stones.

This is another way that Pokémon evolve. Some Pokémon only evolve if they are traded to a friend. 
Some Pokémon only evolve if traded to a friend while holding an item.
Some Pokemon only evolve if they're traded with another, specific Pokemon.

Another way Pokémon evolve is through happiness. Whenever the player character in the game walks 100 steps, gives their Pokémon a vitamin such as Protein, Iron, Carbos, Calcium, or Zinc, training it until it gains a level, or when the character does something else to make it happy, it will gain happiness points. The item Soothe Bell multiplies this amount. Once a Pokémon has reached a certain happiness level, it will evolve after it is leveled once, sometimes depending on the time of day:

Eevee evolves into either Espeon or Umbreon if its happiness rating is maxed out; into Espeon if this happens during the day, or Umbreon if it happens during the night. This day-and-night distinction exists only in the second-generation games and the generations that follow (but not in "Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen").

Pokémon can evolve after learning certain moves and leveling up.


Some Pokémon can evolve only if they are a certain gender.


Some Pokémon can evolve into a Mega form during a battle if they are holding a Mega Stone. The evolution only lasts for the battle.

A large number of different items exist. They are used to help the player or their Pokémon.

A Poké Ball is a red-and-white sphere that is used to catch Pokémon. Many different forms of it exist, such as the Great Ball, the Ultra Ball, the Heavy Ball, the Net Ball, the Dive Ball, the Friend Ball, and the Master Ball (which can catch any Pokémon without fail). Each of these have different colors and can be used to catch different Pokémon more effectively.

The Pokédex is a tool used by Pokémon trainers all around the Pokémon world in different regions. These regions include the Unova region, the Sinnoh region, the Hoenn region, the Johto region and the Kanto region. The Pokédex makes records of information about each of the different Pokémon. There are 801 different species of Pokémon recorded in the world today. Different Pokémon are caught in different regions and some Pokémon can only be caught in certain regions, such as Xerneas in the Kalos Region.

Legendary Pokémon are Pokémon that are very rare, and there is usually only one in each game. Examples of legendaries are Articuno, Zapdos, Mewtwo, Lugia, Groudon, and Dialga. They are hard to catch, and are stronger than most Pokémon. Some roam around, while others can be found in one spot until you KO or capture them. If you KO a legendary, it will usually leave and will never be found again unless the game is restarted or the Elite Four is defeated again. Because of this, players usually save before engaging the Pokémon.

Mythical Pokémon are the rarest type of Pokémon, only found by one-time events. Examples of Mythical Pokémon are Mew, Celebi, and Jirachi.

Shiny Pokémon are a different color than that Pokémon normal for their species. Some examples would be a yellow Bulbasaur (they are usually greenish-blue) or a red Gyarados (they are usually blue). They are extremely rare; there is only a 1 in 4,096 chance of an encountered Pokémon being shiny, but there are ways to improve your chances of obtaining one, which vary per game. Some Pokemon in the same evolution line have different shiny colors, even if their regular colors are the same. For example, Ponyta and Rapidash normally have reddish-orange flames. However, shiny Ponyta have blue flames while shiny Rapidash have silver flames.

Mudkip

Mudkip is a character of the Pokémon anime and video game series. Known as the Mud Fish Pokémon, Mudkip first appeared in 2003 in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, as one of three starter Pokémon the player can choose from at the beginning of the games. Mudkip and members of its evolution family dwell in swamps or other wetlands, deep inside isolated islands, because of their dislike of fresh water lakes and ponds. Mudkip have appeared on the boxart for "", "", "Pokémon Channel", and "Pokémon Dash".

They are small blue Pokémon with a large fin on their head that allows them to sense movements within the air and water, acting as a radar. While in the water, they use the orange, spiky gills on their cheeks to breathe while using their large tail fin to propel themselves. They are extremely strong, despite their small bodies; they are able to lift or crush large boulders. When sleeping, they bury themselves within the soil at the edge of the water. Mudkip and members of its evolution family dwell in swamps or other wetlands, deep inside isolated islands, because of their dislike of fresh water lakes and ponds.

Mudkip is one of the three starter pokemon, along with Treeko and Torchic, in "Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire". Mudkip undergo evolution, a metamorphic change within a Pokémon caused by gaining experience in battle and growing up in terms of levels, in which they can evolve into Marshtomp, and again into Swampert. They are not available in later games "Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen" and "Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum" except through trade.

Mudkip have made cameo appearances in the Game Boy Advance game "" (a sequel of the Game Boy Color game "Pokémon Pinball"); they have also starred in the Nintendo GameCube games "Pokémon Channel", "Pokémon Colosseum", and "". They are featured in Nintendo DS games "Pokémon Dash", "Pokémon Ranger", "Pokémon Mystery Dungeon" and "Pokémon Trozei", as well as being featured on the boxart for many of these. Mudkip appears in Super Smash Bros. Brawl as a trophy that can be obtained through special means.

In the "Pokémon" anime, Brock, a Pokémon breeder and former Gym leader, obtains a Mudkip on Dewford Island. As Ash Ketchum and his companions climb a waterfall, they come across a group of young Mudkip. Brock rescues one of the Mudkip from being washed away in a stream. Brock's Lotad and Mudkip work together to defeat Team Rocket, at which point the Mudkip decides to join Brock's team. Mudkip's primary role is to assist Brock during water related situations, such as searching for objects in the ocean, such as an Illumise and a pearl belonging to a Spoink. Mudkip also guides the Pokémon when Brock, Ash and May aren't around. It evolves into Marshtomp during a training battle versus Ash's Grovyle. A separate Mudkip also appears when the group meet a trainer called Nicolai, a young trainer, who is training his first Pokémon, Mudkip, which later defeats May's Torchic in a battle. Nicolai connects with his Pokémon in battle by dressing up in a suit resembling his Pokémon, wearing both Mudkip and Zigzagoon outfits in the episode.

In the manga "Pokémon Adventures" during the arc based off of "Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire", Ruby, the male protagonist, obtains a Mudkip named Zuzu as his starter Pokémon from Professor Birch. Ruby becomes a Pokémon coordinator, a person who uses their Pokémon for contests rather than battles, and uses Zuzu in those contests. At the beginning Ruby was dissaponted with it because it wasn't pretty enough like his other Pokémon, but then he decided that Tough Contests would be perfect for it. Zuzu was first used to battle against Sapphire, Ruby's rival in the manga. Zuzu evolved into a Marshtomp unexpectedly while Ruby was in Slateport City, and again into a Swampert, while training near Fortree City.

In the "Pokémon Trading Card Game", Mudkip is a Water-type Basic Pokémon, just like its video game counterparts. As a Basic Pokémon, it can be played in a battle, as the competitions of the card game are called, without the use of a special card. If the player has a Marshtomp card in their hand, they can play it on top of the Mudkip card, which is the card game's equivalent of evolving. Mudkip has appeared in the sets "EX Ruby & Sapphire", "EX Dragon", and "EX Emerald". It also appears in "EX Team Rocket Returns", but as "Mudkip Star". This card is different to the other Mudkip cards, because it is the rarest in the set.
Mudkip is the inspiration for an internet meme called "so I herd u like mudkips". Originating on another website, members of 4chan adopted it as an in-joke. Since then, the meme has grown steadily, now including thousands of Youtube videos in tribute and has been named by the "Wall Street Journal" as one of 4Chan's "Greatest Hits". On April 1, 2008, DeviantART played an April Fool's Day joke on its members, changing all their users avatars to images of Mudkip.

GameFAQs's sixth and seventh annual character battles featured Mudkip, with him losing in round one against Luigi and Mega Man X respectively.

Star Wars: Dark Forces

Star Wars: Dark Forces is a first-person shooter computer game which takes place in the "Star Wars" universe. It was made by LucasArts. It came out in 1995 for MS-DOS and Apple Macintosh, and a version was later made for Sony Playstation.

The player controls Kyle Katarn, who was once a stormtrooper for the Galactic Empire but left the Empire to become a mercenary. In "Dark Forces", Katarn works for the Rebellion which fights against the Empire. The game's story is about Kyle finding and stopping an Imperial weapons program called the Dark Trooper Project.

Everything in the game is set in the Star Wars universe. Many things in the game are taken from the original Star Wars trilogy movies, such as several weapons and most of the game's enemies, but some things were made just for "Dark Forces". 

Many of the planets that the levels take place on were created for Dark Forces, but a few of them are from "Star Wars" books. 

"Dark Forces" is a first person shooter, so the player controls Katarn and sees from Katarn's eyes. Much of the gameplay is about fighting and shooting enemies, but there are also many puzzles to solve to move through the missions. 

The player can run, strafe, jump, crouch, and move through shallow water. The player can also look up and down. The game can be controlled with keys on the keyboard, and also a mouse can be used to run, turn, and shoot. 

The game is made up of separate missions. Each mission has certain goals that the player must finish. The missions are all part of the story. Katarn's pilot drops him off and picks him up, but he goes through the missions alone without any help.

There are many different weapons in the game that the player can use and that enemies also use. Most of the weapons shoot blaster bolts or other projectiles, but the player can also throw "thermal detonators" like grenades. Some of the weapons have a "secondary" fire mode which shoots in a different way.

The story is told in two ways. One way is cutscenes, which are animated videos that play between some missions. Also, before each mission the player is given a briefing which talks about what is happening in the story and what the mission goals are.

In the first mission, Katarn steals the Death Star plans so the Rebels can destroy the Death Star. The rest of the game is a different story. 

The Rebels find out about a secret Imperial program called the Dark Trooper Project. The Dark Trooper project is a plot to create new robotic Stormtroopers that are very powerful and dangerous.

Kyle searches for clues about the Dark Trooper Project and sets off to stop it.

C.A. Huracán

Club Atlético Huracán is a sports club from the Parque Patricios neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The football team currently plays in the Primera A, the first level of the Argentine football league system. Huracán home stadium is the Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó.

Huracán was founded on November 1, 1908, in the Nueva Pompeya neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The club's name and nickname ("Globo", literally "Balloon") come from the "Huracán" balloon flied by Jorge Newbery in 1909. Apart from that, club supporters are called "los Quemeros" ("the Burners") because the stadium is in a former garbage burning area.

During the professional era, Huracán won the Primera División title just once (the 1973 Metropolitano), and obtained 4 titles during the amateur era (in 1921, 1922, 1925 and 1928). Moreover, Huracán has finished as runner-up of the first division 5 times during professionalism (the last one in the 2009 Clausura).

Huracán's historical rival is San Lorenzo de Almagro.

Though officially founded in 1908, there are documents that tell about a previous foundation on May 25, 1903. During the amateur era of Argentine football (1891–1930), Huracán won four championships (1921, 1922, 1925 and 1928). The team was the fifth most successful during that period.

During the professional era (started in 1931), Huracán had their moment of glory in the "Metropolitano" championship of the 1973 season, when they won their only first division title. The team has also won twice the second division (1989–90 and 1999–00). The club has had 4 promotions and relegations during their history. The last promotion came during the 2006–07 season, when Huracán defeated Godoy Cruz in the promotion playoffs.

Huracán was runner-up of the Primera División in the 2009 Clausura. The team, coached by Ángel Cappa and with Mario Bolatti, Matías Defederico and Javier Pastore as key players, was praised for their attacking short-pass style of play. They reached the final game of the season one point above Vélez Zársfield, but lost 1-0 away with that team in the final fixture (in a game with controversial referral decisions).

The Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó was closed in May 2008, after cracks were discovered in one of the structural columns. While the stadium was out of commission, Huracán played their home games at Argentinos Juniors. In August 2008, Fernando "la tota" Blauzwirn, an old player from the 1940s correctly said "no veo la hora de volver al Ducó, qué sufrimiento muyayo!" (I cannot wait until returning to the Duco, guys, what a suffering!).

On 13 December 2008 during the final weekend of the 2008-09 Apertura championship, Huracán returned to the Ducó, 438 days after they'd last played there. Their 3-0 victory against Vélez was the only game Huracan played at home during their centenary year.

Gresham's law

Gresham's law is commonly written: "Bad money drives out good."

If people want one thing ("good" money) more than the other ("bad" money), they will always offer the bad money in trade before the good money. Over time, the good money will be kept in pocket, and only the bad money will be found in the market. The law is named after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519-1579). Gresham founded the Royal Exchange in 1565. 

Silver coins were widely circulated in Canada (until 1968) and in the United States (until 1964 for dimes (ten cents) and quarters and 1970 for half dollars). However, these countries made their coins cheaper to make by switching to cheaper metals. The silver coins disappeared from circulation as people kept them for the value of their metal. The new coins had value as coins, but less value as metal.

The same process happens now with the copper content of coins such as the pre-1997 Canadian penny (one cent), the pre-1982 United States penny and the pre-1992 UK copper pennies and two pence.
This also occurred even with coins made of less expensive metals such as steel in India.

Benjamin Netanyahu

Binyamin "Bibi" Netanyahu (, born 21 October 1949) is the current and ninth Prime Minister of Israel.

He became prime minister on 29 December 2022. He was also prime minister from 2009 to 2021 and before that from 1996 to 1999.

Netanyahu is leader of the HaLikud party and the first Israeli prime minister born after the establishment of the state of Israel. He is also the country’s longest-serving prime minister. From 2021 until 2022, he was Leader of the Opposition, which he also was from 2005 to 2009

The deal said that Gantz would be Vice Prime Minister until October 2021, by then he would replace Netanyahu to become Prime Minister.

In May 2021, Hamas fired rockets on Israel from Gaza, which caused Netanyahu to act Operation Guardian of the Walls, lasting eleven days.

After the 2021 Israel-Palestine crisis, Israeli politician and leader of the Yamina alliance Naftali Bennett announced that he has agreed to a deal with Yair Lapid to forge a coalition government that would remove Netanyahu from his Prime Minister position. This is after the 2021 March election.

After the 2022 election, Netanyahu was sworn in as Prime Minister again. He officially started his sixth term on 29 December 2022.

Quickie (sex)

A quickie is a brief act of sexual intercourse. People will not usually have much foreplay with a quickie.

A quickie may not always mean sexual intercourse. It may be oral sex or mutual masturbation. According to some, a quickie between a heterosexual couple generally satisfies only the man. Others claim that quickies (with intercourse or some other form of stimulation of the vulva) can also be "a major turn-on" for a woman. Since it may not give a woman enough time to lubricate naturally, she might need a lubricant. Some consider quickies a solution to unequal sexual desire in a relationship. If they become the only form of sex, the relationship may suffer. For gay men, a quickie sometimes means casual sex, like a hand job. It does not usually happen with lesbians, however.

Deep-throating

Deep throating is a form of fellatio, when an erect penis is placed inside a partner's mouth, deep enough to enter the throat. The person whose penis is inserted is normally referred as the receiving partner, and the person who performs deep-throating is referred to as the giving partner.

It is difficult for most people to perform deep-throating, because of the natural gag reflex that happens when the soft palate is touched. Different people have different sensitivities to the reflex, but some people learn to suppress the reflex. 

Usually, the giving partner's tongue is immobilized during deep-throating and they also are not able to suck.

The position of both partners is important in performing deep throat. For deep-throating, the giving partner's mouth and throat will need to be aligned (made into) into a straight line, and he or she will need to breathe through the nose. It is important for the giving partner to be in a position to control any pelvic thrust during deep-throating, to be able to pull the penis out if needed; and for the receiving partner not to thrust, as during irrumatio.

"Over-the-edge" is a common position for deep-throating. In this position, the giving partner lays on his/her back with the head hanging off the edge of the bed and the receiving partner stands or places himself on his knees in front of the giving partner, with his penis at the giving partner's mouth.

Another position used for deep-throating involves the giving partner sitting on the receiving partner's chest, with his feet or penis in front of the giving partner. 

The 69 position is another position for deep-throating.

Fisting

Fisting is a sexual activity. The fister puts his or her hand into the vagina or rectum. The fingers are then clenched into a fist or kept straight. Fisting may be done with or without a partner.

Fistees is another form of fisting. It is for the more experienced. It may take two fists. This is called double fisting. Double fisting pleasure depends more on stretching of the anus or vagina rather than thrusting with an in-and-out movement of the hands.

Fisting can cause lacerations to the vagina, perineum, rectum, and/or colon. This may result in serious injury. These lacerations may even lead to death. Sexual activities that cause air to enter the vagina can lead to a fatal air clot. The risk is probably even higher during pregnancy.

Fisting can cause cutting or tearing or of the vagina, perineum, rectum, and/or colon, resulting in serious injury and even death. In general, sexual activities that cause air to enter the vagina can lead to a fatal air clot, and the risk is probably even higher during pregnancy.

Anal fisting carries risks of colorectal tearing; people doing it should use latex gloves and lubricant, and have a safeword, which they can say when they want it to stop immediately. The practice, along with the insertion of hard objects into the anus or the vagina has been significantly related to the traumatization of the vaginal or rectal mucosa in increasing the likelihood of infection, including Hepatitis B virus.

Samuel Kuffour

Samuel Kuffour (born 3 September 1976) is a former Ghanaian football player. He has played for Ghana national team. He mostly played as a central defender , but was also used as a right full-back from time to time. He had his greatest successes with FC Bayern Munich, with whom he won, among other things, the Champions League once and the German championship and the DFB Cup several times. Known for his physical power, He was a rocky central defender, he was physically strong and skilled in tackling. Regarded as one of the best African defenders of all time, he is also considered to be one of the most decorated players in African football history.

Kuffour played for Fantomas Kumasi in his hometown from the age of seven to fourteen and moved to local rivals King Faisal Babes in 1990. In 1991 he got the chance to move abroad and joined the youth department of Torino FC. He played there for two years until FC Bayern Munich signed him. From 1993 to 2005 he played for the German record champions, and from 1994 in the first team. On October 29, 1994, Kuffour made his debut in a 2-2 home game against VfB Stuttgart, against whom he also scored his first Bundesliga goal on October 15, 1997 with the goal to make it 3-3. In retrospect, Kuffour described leaving his homeland early as a difficult step. Shortly before the second half of the 1995/96 season he was loaned to the second division club 1. FC Nürnberg until the end of the season. In January 2001, FC Barcelona showed great interest in the then 24-year-old, but Bayern manager Uli Hoeneß described the Ghanaian as “not for sale”. 

Kuffour achieved his greatest successes with FC Bayern: He lost the Champions League final against Manchester United in 1999, but won it in Milan in 2001 against FC Valencia. In the following World Cup game against their counterpart from South America, Boca Juniors , Kuffour contributed to the title win with his goal to make it 1-0 after extra time. He also won six German championships, the DFB Cup four times and the League Cup five times. In 175 Bundesliga games, the Ghanaian scored seven times in the opposing goal. After the signing of Lúcio in the summer of 2004, Kuffour was only the number five central defender behind Robert Kovač, Martin Demichelis, Thomas Linke and the Brazilian world champion. So an imminent departure became apparent. In December 2004, Middlesbrough FC 's interest in Kuffour became known, but a move did not materialize. 

For the 2005/06 season, Kuffour moved to the Italian first division club AS Roma, where he received a three-year contract. After a good start that saw Roma fans compare him to the Brazilian icon Aldair, things quickly went downhill. Kuffour played the 2006/07 season on loan at league rivals AS Livorno. He last played for Livorno in the European Cup.

After half a year without playing for AS Roma, Kuffour moved to the first division club Ajax Amsterdam in January 2008, where he was intended to replace the resigned Jaap Stam. Kuffour was unable to close the gap and left Ajax after just two appearances in six months. After a month without a club, the move to FK Khimki in the Russian Premier League was announced as fixed, which, however, turned out to be a newspaper duck ; As a result, Kuffour's agent Giuseppe dello Russo announced Kuffour's end to his career at the beginning of September 2008. Kuffour himself explained that he had just taken a break and was still looking for a new club. In April 2009 he signed a contract with Asante Kotoko, the then champions of the Ghana Premier League, where he finally ended his career after the three-month contract period had expired.

Kuffour was known for his consistency and reliability. On good days he was a world-class defender, on great days he was a threat to the team's success.

Kuffour played his first game for Ghana at the age of 17 against Sierra Leone . From March 5th to 20th, 1993 he took part in the U-20 World Cup in Australia, played six games until the final, which was lost 2-1 to Brazil, and scored on March 9th in the second group game (at 2:2 draw against Germany ) took the 1-0 lead and thus his only goal of the tournament. From August 21 to September 4, 1993, Kuffour took part in the U-17 World Cup in Japan. He played all games except the quarter-finals (1-0 win over Australia), but lost the final 1-2 against Nigeria.

Kuffour took part in the Olympic football tournament with the Olympic team in 1992 and 1996. In the first tournament, in the game for third place (1-0 win over Australia), he won the bronze medal with the team. He also took part in the African Championships in 1996, 1998, 2000 ( captain of the senior national team since 1999 ), 2002, 2006, with fourth place in 1996 being the national team's greatest success to date.

Kuffour also took part in the 2006 World Cup, where he made such a serious mistake in the first group game against Italy that he was then replaced in his position by Illiasu Shilla. When passing back to the own goalkeeper, the ball unfortunately reached striker Vincenzo Iaquinta, who was ready to take a shot, who made it 2-0 in the 83rd minute and gave his team the preliminary decision.

Chalcedonian Creed

The Chalcedonian Creed is a creed which was made during the Council of Chalcedon in the year 451. This council is one of the seven ecumenical councils. It is recognised by the Eastern Orthodox, the Catholics, and by many Protestant Churches. It is the first council the Oriental Orthodox Church does not recognize. 

The Chalcedonian creed was written during a controversy between the Western and Eastern Churches. They could not agree about the meaning of Incarnation, the influence of the emperor in the church, and the role of the Roman Pope. The Western Churches had no problems accepting the creed, but some Eastern Churches had.

The creed became doctrine in the Orthodox Church. The Coptic church of Alexandria disagreed. They used Cyril's formula instead. They said that the creed should say that Christ be acknowledged "from two natures" rather than "in two natures".

Kyneton

Kyneton is a town in central Victoria, Australia. In 2006 there were 5,905 people living in Kyneton. It is on the Calder Highway, but the Calder Freeway now goes around the town to the north and east. Kyneton was named after the English village of Kineton, Warwickshire. Piper Street is the oldest street and still has many of its old buildings.

The town is the centre for the local government area, the Shire of Macedon Ranges.

Kyneton is famous for its springs, the Campaspe River, public gardens and old houses, many built from stone. Kyneton has several events during the year including the ANZAC Day parade, the Kyneton Jazz Festival, Kyneton Daffodil Festival, Kyneton Agricultural show and the Kyneton Cup (horse racing). The famous bushranger, Ned Kelly, was put on trial in the Kyneton Courthouse in 1870 for robbery. This courthouse is still in use.

The first European to explore the Kyneton area was Major Thomas Mitchell who crossed and named the Campaspe River in 1836. The first settlers came to Kyneton later that year.

Kyneton is different from other towns in the area as it was settled in 1850, a year before the gold rushes started. It was a farming area which became an important stop for those people going to the gold rushes at Mount Alexander and Bendigo. The post office opened on 1 July 1843, as Mount Macedon, but was renamed Kyneton on 1 January 1854.

Kyneton has its own newspaper, the "Midland Express", which also serves Castlemaine.

There are two primary schools, Kyneton Primary School and Our Lady of the Rosary. There are two secondary schools, Kyneton Secondary College and Sacred Heart College. There is also the Kyneton campus of the Bendigo Regional Institute of TAFE (BRIT), and the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE (NMIT), NMIT Kyneton Park Training Centre at the Kyneton Racecourse.

The town has a football team which plays in the Bendigo Football League.

Kyneton has a horse racing club, the Kyneton District Racing Club, which holds about 16 race meetings a year. The Kyneton Cup meeting is in November, the day after the Melbourne Cup. In 2009 the Kyneton District Racing Club joined with the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE to use the racecourse for educational training.

The Kyneton Golf Club is on Black Hill Road.

Kyneton has a soccer team, "The Rangers", which plays in the Bendigo Amateur Soccer League "BASL"

Mount Fraser

Mount Fraser is a volcanic cone near Beveridge, Victoria, Australia. The extinct volcano last erupted about one million years ago. It is about 120 metres in height above the surrounding land. The distance around the base of the volcano is 1200 metres. There are two craters. One crater is wide and shallow, and the other is small and closed. It is been listed on the Australian Heritage database.

The explorers, Hamilton Hume and William Hovell, first climbed Mount Fraser on 14 December 1824, and saw Port Phillip Bay. It was called Mount Bland and Big Hill in the past. The bushranger Ned Kelly was born near Mount Fraser. The volcano was also a site for flying gliders.

There is a quarry on the side of the hill which digs out scoria for building in Melbourne.

Lucario

Lucario is a character of the Pokémon anime and video game series. It is also known as the Aura Pokémon. This pokemon has the ability to feel the auras of things. It is a Fighting and Steel Pokémon. It is seen in the games "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl", and in the movie "Lucario and the Mystery of Mew". In an interview with "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl" director Junichi Masuda, he said that Lucario's name was one of the hardest to make. This was because they wanted to make it work for both the Japanese and Americans.

Lucario is a human-like Pokémon that's around four feet in height. Lucario's hands are black and have one white spike on each arm on the top of its wrists, and there's a third spike on Lucario's chest. Lucario's nose and ears are longer since it evolved from Riolu. Lucario has a furry yellow body, and its hips are in the shape of what looks like blue shorts. It has the ability to sense the aura in all living things, and can use telepathic human speech. By catching the Aura coming from others, it can read their thoughts. A well-trained one can sense auras of creatures over half a mile away.

Lucario is a Pokémon that appears in the Nintendo DS versions of "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl"; Lucario is used by Maylene, the third Sinnoh Gym Leader, a tag-team partner known as Riley, and by Cynthia, Sinnoh's Elite Four Champion. In "Pokémon Mystery Dungeon" Lucario is seen as the greatest rescue leader of all time, and earning 15,000 Rescue Points will put the player in the top rank - the Lucario rank - and the Lucario statue will be put outside the rescue base.

It is a fighter in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and uses attacks like Aura Sphere, Force Palm, ExtremeSpeed, Double Team, and its final smash, Aura Storm. Lucario was confirmed to be a playable character in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" due to a leak. After seeing their mistake they quickly fixed it. Lucario and Jigglypuff can no longer be seen but there are many YouTube videos which show proof of the leak, as well as screen shots.

In Pokémon X and Y, the player receives a free Lucario from Korrina. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Lucario using the Lucarionite.

Lucario's main role in the anime is his appearance in the eighth Pokémon movie, "Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew". In the movie, Lucario is a servant to Sir Aaron in a Renaissance-themed city called Cameron Palace. Aaron had trained this Lucario to use aura. Lucario thinks of Sir Aaron as both his master and close friend. After Aaron traps him in a magic staff at the film's start, Lucario begins questioning any Pokémon-human relationship. The Lucario in the movie, can also speak human languages without psychic powers. Lucario sacrificed himself in order to save the Tree of Beginning, though the credits showed him with Sir Aaron eating a chocolate bar.

Maylene in the anime, like in the games, has a Lucario and it was seen in four episodes. It was first seen battling with Maylene in their training. Lucario used Aura Sphere to stop the battle of Electabuzz, Piplup, and Pikachu, and is seen battling Paul's Pokémon in a flashback. Lucario was seen again where it battled in Dawn's gym battle with Maylene, where it defeated Dawn's Ambipom and Piplup. Then, in the next episode, it battled in Ash's gym battle against Maylene. It defeated Ash's Staravia and Chimchar, but was knocked out along with Ash's Buizel, which ended in a tie. Finaly, Lucario was seen when it helped Ash and the others defeat Saturn and Team Galactic.

In the Pokémon Adventures manga, like in games, it appears under the ownership of Riley who was on a boat heading to the Battle Frontier. Diamond meets Riley at Iron Island, and Byron asks Riley to help Diamond sharpen his Pokémon battle skills before Diamond goes to Lake Verity. In "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Adventure!" the main character, Hareta, gained a Riolu egg which hatched into a Riolu later on in that chapter and then evolved in to Lucario.

UGO described Lucario as "a new breed of Pokémon, with a cooler, more dangerous look. It's quick and possesses a damaging set of attacks", yet called it lame due to its status as a Pokémon. IGN called its presence in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" "a bit on the head scratching side" in light of more familiar characters in the title such as Pikachu. Although another editor stated that it would make sense for "Pokémon" to be represented by a fighting-type Pokémon, since "Super Smash Bros Brawl" is a fighting game. GamesRadar described it as an "all-around bad-ass" and "the Bruce Lee of Pokémon", suggesting its design as similar to the Egyptian God Anubis. Beckett "Pokémon" Unofficial Collector editor Sean Cooper stated that Lucario had grown popular in recent years due to his starring role in "Lucario and the Mystery of Mew" and his appearance in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl".

Hertzsprung–Russell diagram

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is a graph of many stars. It shows the relation between stars' luminosity (how bright they are) and their temperature (how hot they are). 

These diagrams are not pictures or maps of where the stars are. Rather, Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams plot each star on a scatter graph showing the star's brightness versus its temperature. Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are also called H-R diagrams or HRDs.

You can see an example of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to the right. This diagram is based on measurements from 23,000 stars in our Milky Way galaxy. 

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is named after its creators, astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell.

The vertical axis of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows the luminosity or brightness of the stars, as if they were all measured from the same distance. Another term for this is absolute magnitude. The brighter a star is, the higher its plot will be on this chart.

The horizontal axis shows the surface temperature of the stars. However, the temperatures go "down", not up, as you move to the right. That is, the left of the diagram contains stars with the highest temperature plots (greater than 30,000 Kelvins) while the right shows stars with temperatures of only 3000K.

In general, the temperature of a star relates to its color. At the top of the chart, along with the temperatures, are the spectral classes. The hottest stars are blue-white (class O), those in the middle temperatures are yellow (class G) and the coolest ones are red (class M). When we say "coolest" about stars, the lowest temperature for a star is almost 5000 degrees Fahrenheit.

As a matter of fact, when Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams were developed in the early 1900's, astronomers did not know how to find out the temperature of a star. The first diagrams plotted stars' absolute magnitude against color, represented by the spectral classes from blue-white to red. 

As you can see, stars tend to fall only into certain regions of the diagram when graphed in this way. All stars in a given area of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram share similar luminosities and temperatures. The main region where stars appear is the diagonal curved line, going from the upper-left (hot and bright) to the lower-right (cooler and less bright). This is called the Main Sequence. Above the main sequence is another region containing the red giants and supergiants. Below is a curved line representing the white dwarfs.

These collections of stars by brightness and temperature are important when talking about stellar evolution. In general, stars are created in the main sequence. (Of course, when we say ""in" the main sequence" we really mean "having a brightness and a temperature that causes them to be plotted within the main sequence on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.") After billions of years, they expand into red giants. Then, after another one or two billion years, they shrink into white dwarfs.

It was only in the 1930's and 1940's that scientists began to understand the role of nuclear fusion in creating and keeping stars like our sun. These days Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are used to present stellar evolution in pictures to students. They're not used much any more for developing new scientific theories.

On a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, our Sun is plotted very close to the middle of the main sequence at the intersection of luminosity 1 and temperature 5780K. Therefore, the Sun is class G or a "yellow star").


Seabird

Seabirds are birds that have adapted so they are better able to live at sea or near it. Many seabirds live "at sea", that is, far away from land. They may only come on land to breed. Other seabirds live in colonies on islands. Very often, seabirds use the sea for food, most often fish or shellfish. The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families first appeared in the Palaeogene. The similarities between them are examples of convergent evolution. The same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations. 

Seabirds share a number of adaptations to sea life. They live longer, breed later and have fewer young than other birds. They do spend a great deal of time with their young. Most species nest in colonies. These vary from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species take long annual migrations every year, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds vary in how much of the year they spend at sea.

Tropical Depression One (2009)

Tropical Depression One was the first tropical cyclone of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. It was also the third tropical cyclone since 2007 to form before June 1. The storm formed on May 28, and moved across the Atlantic Ocean. Later that day, the storm started to weaken and fall apart. On May 29, the storm died and became a remnant low.

Before the storm became a depression, some parts of the storm brought light rainfall to the eastern tip of North Carolina. However there were no damages or deaths reported. Also the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not give out any tropical storm watches or warnings for the storm.

During mid-May, a disorganized low pressure area formed in the Atlantic Ocean about 290 miles (465 kilometers) south-southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina. The low pressure moved north and started to become more organized. On May 27, the storm was 120 miles (195 km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina when the National Hurricane Center (NHC) decided to start monitoring the storm. A high pressure area that was located southeast of the storm pushed it into a northeast direction. Then on 8 pm EDT (0000 UTC on May 28), the NHC stopped monitoring the storm, as the low was not expected to strengthen anymore.

On May 28, the NHC started to monitor the storm again and on 11:00 am EDT (1500 UTC), they declared the storm to be a tropical cyclone and named it Tropical Depression One. At that time, the storm's location was about 310 mi (500 km) south of Providence, Rhode Island. After it was named as a depression, the storm showed deep convection and the center of circulation was at the northwestern part of the storm. The reason why the depression restrengthened was because of lower wind shear and warmer ocean waters from the Gulf Stream. Later that day, the depression started to weaken when it moved into an area with higher wind shear and colder ocean waters. Around 7:30 pm EDT (2330 UTC), a QuikSCAT satellite flew over the depression and found tropical storm-force winds. But the NHC thought the depression didn't strengthen and that winds were affected by rain. After the satellite passed over the depression, the center of circulation moved closer to the northwest edge of the storm and convection started to decrease.
On May 29, the depression almost became a tropical storm, when the storm's strength was measured at T2.5, or 40 mph (65 km/h) using the Dvorak technique. But some of the measurements were also low as T1.5, which was the reason why the NHC didn't call it a tropical storm. After a quick burst of convection during the night, thunderstorm clouds inside the depression started to disappear by 3:00 am EDT (0700 UTC). By then, the tropical depression was no longer expected to strength anymore and was forecasted to weaken. A few hours later, the center of circulation was ripped apart by strong wind shear while a nearby trough also started to absorb the rest of the storm. With no convection around the center of the storm, it became a remnant low during the afternoon. At 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC), the NHC gave out its last advisory on Tropical Depression One. The remains of the storm were later taken in by a warm front around 2 am EDT (0600 UTC).

On May 27 the cyclone brought some light rainfall to parts of coastal North Carolina before it was called Tropical Depression One. Hatteras, North Carolina saw 0.1 in (2.5 mm) of rainfall and wind speeds up to 15 mph (24 km/h) with gusts to 23 mph (37 km/h). The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded from the storm was 1009 mbar (hPa; 29.81 inHg).

When the storm became Tropical Depression One on May 28, it was the third time since 1851 that an Atlantic tropical cyclone formed before June 1, the official start of an Atlantic hurricane season. The depression followed Subtropical Storm Andrea of May 2007 and Tropical Storm Arthur of May 2008. The first time this event happened was in 1932, 1933, and 1934; the second time it happened was in 1951, 1952, and 1953. The National Hurricane Center also reported that Tropical Depression One was also the farthest north a May tropical cyclone has ever formed.

Trust (social science)

Trust is a feeling that somebody or something can be relied upon, or will turn out to be good. It is the feeling of being sure about something, even if it cannot be proved. 

The word "trust" can be a noun or a verb:


There is also an adjective: trusting.

One can also trust a thing:


To "trust" often means: to feel confident that something will or has happened:

In religion, trust can be similar to faith. Someone who believes in God will put their trust in Him: the Book of Proverbs says: 'Trust in the LORD with all your heart' (3:5)

To "trust" (or "entrust") can be used in other ways:

Trusting does not necessarily mean that the person or thing that is trusted is good. Two criminals might be friends and they might trust one another, but what they trust one another to do is bad (although it might seem good to them).

Being trusting without thinking carefully about it might be dangerous. People can sometimes win someone’s trust, but then they might break their trust.

The opposite of “trusting” is “mistrust” (“to have no trust in”). This is similar to the word “suspicious”.

Someone who is untrustworthy is someone who cannot be trusted.

To “take something on trust” means: to trust something without looking at it carefully.

Hinche

Hinche (Kréyòl: "Ench") is a city in the centre of Haiti. It is the capital city of the Centre "Département".

The city is in the region called "Plateau Central" about northeast of Port-au-Prince. It is also the chief town of an "arrondissement" (a part of a department) with the same name. The "arrondissement" has four "communes" (a "commune" is like a municipality): Hinche, Cerca-Cavajal (Kreyòl: "Sèka Kavajal"), Maïssade (Kreyòl: "Mayisad") and Thomonde (Kreyòl: "Tomonn").

Hinche is on the southern limit of the Plateau Central, a long valley between the "Massif du Nord", to the north, and the "Montagne Noire", to the south.

The city is on the right side of the River Guayamouc, a tributary of the River Artibonite.

The city was founded in 1704 with families that came from the Canary Islands; it took the Taíno name of the region: "Hincha". The French people changed the name to Hinche but in Spanish it is still Hincha. At that moment, the region was part of the Spanish colony of "Santo Domingo" (now the Dominican Republic).

After the Haitian Revolution, in the early 19th century, this region became part of the new Republic of Haiti but the Dominican Republic accepted the transfer of the region to Haiti only in 1929.

"Bassin Zim", to the east of Hinche, is a beautiful 20 m waterfall, a 30-minute drive from town.

In the city you will also find the "Cathédrale de Sacré-Coeur" ("Sacred Heart Cathedral").

Diponegoro

Diponegoro was a Javanese prince who opposed the Dutch rule in Indonesia. He was the eldest son of Sultan 
Hamengkubowono III. Diponegoro was born at Yogyakarta in 1785 and died at Makassar in 1855. During the Dutch rule, a ruler like his father had lost many rights such as the ability to lease land. Instead, he was paid by the Dutch to keep peace. This was an indignity to his father. This led to an open battle headed by Diponegoro himself using guerrilla tactics, which was called the Java War. It lasted for five years, from 1825 until 1830. During that period Diponegoro had successfully led battles, ambushing Dutch camps and raiding food supplies. Over the period of five years, more than 200,000 people were dead because of the war. In 1830, he was sent away by the Dutch to Manado, then moved to Ujungpandang, and he spent the rest of his life there. After being held by the Dutch in Fort Rotterdam in Ujungpandang for 25 years, he died there in 1855.

The Jedi Knight series are a video game series produced by LucasArts. The games may be played as first person shooters or as 3rd person games. They follow the story of the mercenary and later Jedi Kyle Katarn. The player controls Katarn in all of the games except "Jedi Academy".

The games are combat focussed with lots of shooting combat where the player fights enemies with blasters and other weapons that shoot projectiles. Starting in Jedi Knight, Kyle begins to learn The Force and gets a lightsaber, the pinnacle of Star Wars weaponry. When Katarn uses the lightsaber, the game can go into third-person mode where the camera follows Katarn from behind so the player can see Katarn fighting with his lightsaber. Once Katarn learns the Force he may use Light Side and Dark Side powers (such as 'Force Heal' or 'Force Push' respectively)

Projectile

A projectile is something that is sent flying through the air, usually as a weapon. Any solid object that is thrown or fired out of something is a projectile. For example, an arrow fired from a bow, a bullet, or even a rock from a slingshot are all projectiles.

Projectile weapons have been used for a long time. Bows and slingshots are very old weapons that were used hundreds of years ago. Now most countries use projectile weapons instead of melee weapons like swords. This is because modern projectile weapons such as guns, rocket launchers, and artillery cannons can shoot at long ranges and are usually more deadly than melee weapons.

Mathematical physics

In applied mathematics, a branch of mathematics, mathematical physics refers to the knowledge made up of equations and ideas which scientists look to for assistance in modeling, describing, or solving problems in physics or related areas.

There are many teachers that specialize in mathematical physics, one is Edward Witten, pictured here.

Practitioners includes those who develop and apply mathematical physics.

There are several organized associations in mathematical physics, one is the International Association of Mathematical Physics.

Pokémon Adventures

Pokémon Adventures, released in Japan as , is a Pokémon-related manga based on the video games. Satoshi Tajiri once said that this series is closest to what he imagined the Pokémon world to be: 

The series is written by Hidenori Kusaka and drawn by Mato for the first 9 volumes. Satoshi Yamamoto took over from Mato (who was ill at the time) and has not stopped since. The manga was translated into English in North America by VIZ Media, but publication stopped in 2001 at Volume 7. Recently, Viz has begun re-releasing the series in the form of "The Best of Pokémon Adventures: Red" and "The Best of Pokémon Adventures: Yellow", respectively, this time for $7.95 each, $6 less than nearly a decade ago when the publisher first began to publish the manga. VIZ Media has begun to release the series again with a 2nd edition. The first volume was released on June 2, 2009. and the second volume is to be released in August. In Southeast Asia, Singapore publisher Chuang Yi, currently translates Pokémon Adventures into English, and continues to translate new volumes to this day, so far up to volume 57. Jilin Fine Arts, along with the VIZ Media Shanghai Branch, has translated the manga into Chinese. In Taiwan, it is published by Ching Win, who translates it into Mandarin and releases it in their monthly CoroCoro Comic magazine.

Pragmatics

Pragmatics is the study of meaning in language in a particular context. 

This includes the place where the thing is said, who says it, and the things that you have already said. Also, pragmatics studies how people speak when they both know something. 

Pragmatics studies how people speak not literally, but in an indirect way. It studies why, even though this is the case, people can still understand each other. It studies how people can understand each other even if the words are ambiguous.

The ability to understand what someone intends to tell you is called pragmatic competence. 

Inattentional blindness

Inattentional blindness, or perceptual blindness, is 
when a person does not see something in plain sight. The term is only used for a lack of attention, not for any physical defect of vision. The term was used as a book title.

It is a basic fact of psychology that the "world provides an infinite array of things that might capture attention. Attention is, however, an inherently limited capacity". The mechanism as to what to notice is partly or largely inherited. The usefulness of a particular behaviour is in an “ecology of evolutionary adaptiveness” for ancestral hunter-gatherers. Old world monkeys, who show fear of snakes and have an advanced visual system, evolved in Africa under continual pressure from snakes. Some mammals evolved physiological resistance to snake venoms, but African apes improved their ability to see snakes visually before the snakes could strike.

Millionaires (group)

Millionaires is an American electronic trio from Los Angeles, California. It was started in 2007 by three girls, Melissa Marie Green, Allison Green, and Dani Artaud. They are very popular on MySpace. The girls are notable for their mostly negative reaction from other people. They also performed one show for the TV show Double Shot at Love with the Ikki Twins.

Millionaires started in August 2007, when Melissa Marie and Allison made a song on their new laptop with GarageBand. They named the song "I Like Money", and decided they needed a name for themselves to make a MySpace profile for the song. Melissa Marie and Allison decided on Millionaires, to go with the name of the song. Soon after, Dani came in the mix, and they made their second song, "Hoe Down."

After a few months, they began to perform shows locally and traveled only small distances for shows. They got spots in music festivals such as Rockin Roots,Bamboozle Left 2008,and Audio Overload 2008. By July 2008, they were ready to tour and they went out on their first tour co-headlining with another band, Breathe Carolina across the West coast. Later in July, they headlined the GET F$CKED UP tour.

In July 2008, they performed on MTV's TRL as part of On The Radar, a show where popular bands not signed to a record label perform. The girls returned in January and February 2009 on their Just Got Paid, Let's Get Laid tour, which sold out every date. They made a short song titled "Ooh Uh Huh", which became the theme song for MTV's reality show "A Double Shot At Love" with the Ikki twins. Their song "Hey Rich Boy" was also used as the theme for MTV's Teen Cribs.

Before Millionaires were to release their second EP, "Just Got Paid, Let's Get Laid", it was rumored that the Millionaires were signed to Decaydance after Gabe Saporta from Cobra Starship convinved Pete Wentz to sign them on to the label. Later Wentz sent a message saying that Millionaires were not signed to Decaydance, and that Crush management had asked them to produce hard copies of their EP.




Heckler &amp; Koch MP series

The MP series is a "personal defence weapon" (PDW) made by Heckler & Koch in Germany. It is one of the most popular submachine guns in the world. It is used by many different militaries and counter-terrorism and police groups.

The main version of the MP5, the MP5A2, uses 9mm pistol ammunition and shoots 800 rounds per minute, which is about thirteen rounds per second. The normal magazine size (how many bullets it holds at once) is 30 or 15 rounds.

There are many other versions of the gun, some which use different caliber bullets, are shorter, or have other differences. One important type of MP5 is the MP5SD series, which are MP5s with built in suppressors ('silencers'). The MP5SDs are quieter than most guns and can be used for stealth. The MP5 is used by many special forces groups around the world, including the United States Navy Seals and British SAS.

Since it is used by many heroes in pop culture, it is sometimes called the "good guy gun."


The MP7 is the updated MP5. It was designed with a new cartridge with higher muzzle velocity to meet NATO requirements published in 1989. A modern PDW needs greater ability to defeat body armour, because former weapons used only conventional pistol cartridges. The MP7 went into production in 2001. It is a direct rival to the Belgian FN P90, also developed in response to NATO's requirement. The MP7 has been revised since its introduction and the current production version is the MP7A1.

Meishi Street

Meishi Street, directed by Ou Ning, is a 2006 independent Chinese documentary that shows ordinary citizens taking a stand against the planned destruction of their homes for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In order to widen traffic routes for the Olympic Games, the Beijing Municipal Government orders the demolition of entire neighborhoods. Several evictees of Meishi Street, located next to Tiananmen Square, fight through endless red tape and the indifference of fellow citizens for the right to keep their homes. Given video cameras by the filmmakers, they shoot exclusive footage of the eviction process, adding vivid intimacy to their story.



Brentwood College School

Brentwood College School is a boarding school for boys and girls that helps students get ready for university. This school is in a small town called Mill Bay on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. The school has modern classrooms, a theatre, and science labs. The school is next to the ocean. Students study the ocean and can go sailing, rowing, canoeing, and kayaking.

Brentwood College School was started in 1923 in Brentwood Bay. The old school was destroyed by a fire in 1947. The school was then moved to Mill Bay and opened again in 1961. In 1972, girls started going to the school.

Brentwood has tennis courts, rugby fields, student houses, and classrooms. There is a special building for rowing boats, a gymnasium, a medical building, and other buildings. In 1995, the theatre (T. Gill Bunch Centre ) was built. This is a 20,000 square Foot (unit of length) theatre with 431 seats for the audience. Students act, play music, and dance in the theatre.

The theatre uses a heating system that doesn't harm the environment. The school will have another sustainable development building with classrooms, a big dining room and clothes laundry in February 2010.

Brentwood offers lessons that help students get ready for university. These lessons are for students who are in grades 9, 10, 11 or 12. Brentwood is a very good school in British Columbia. All the students go to university when they leave Brentwood.




These are the clubs that students can belong to:

Some of the students receive money to help them study at the school.

The students have won a lot of awards for sports.


Brentwood College has a very good rowing program. Some of the students have rowed in national (Canadian) races and at the Olympic Games. Many of the students who row go to American universities.

Every year Brentwood has a rowing regatta. The regatta is in April for three days. This regatta is the biggest high school rowing regatta in North America, with 1500 students rowing and 3000 people watching.


Cutscene

A cutscene is a time in a video game where the game stops and the player watches something happen. 

Usually cutscenes tell part of the story, such as showing characters talking or having a narrator say what is going on. Sometimes, however, a cutscene just shows something that is happening in the game, like a boss showing up, a ship taking off, or a building falling down.

There are many different types of cutscene. Some cutscenes are very simple and just show pictures with text like a slideshow. Others may be animated like a cartoon. Sometimes the cutscene appears directly in the game engine. 

Many new games use prerendered scenes, meaning that the scene was created when the game was made and saved as a video file. Prerendered videos are sometimes just saved movies of things recorded in the game engine, but some use Computer-generated imagery (CGI), which is separately made 3D graphics which are usually fancier than the game's normal graphics. Prerendered scenes with CGI are often used for a game's intro video.

A few games use live-action video footage, which is filmed like a movie or television show. Sometimes live-action footage will be used together with CGI.

Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution

The Thirteenth Amendment was an amendment to the United States Constitution, meaning that it was a change to the basic and most important laws that govern the United States. It abolished slavery in the United States. It was passed in December 6, 1865, at the end of the Civil War with only a handful of Democrats supporting the Amendment in both Chambers of Congress. It was one of the Reconstruction Amendments. It repealed Article Four, Section 2, of the Constitution; the Fugitive Slave Clause.

Prior to the Civil War, Constitution allowed slavery. However, many groups sought to end slavery in the United States. The groups became the Republican Party in 1856, and gained power in 1860 with the election of Abraham Lincoln.

In 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves only in certain parts of the United States, and did not actually make slavery illegal.

Near the end of the Civil War, Republicans, who controlled Congress, introduced an amendment to make slavery illegal (against the law) in every part of the United States. (In order for an amendment to happen, it first must be passed by both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, and then passed by three-quarters of the states' legislatures.) The amendment was passed by three-quarters of the states, and became law in late 1865.

Hurricane Jeanne

Hurricane Jeanne was the tenth named storm, the seventh hurricane, and the fifth major hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Jeanne was a deadly storm, especially to Haiti. The storm cause 3,035 deaths, about 3,006 were in Haiti alone. Hurricane Jeanne was also a costly hurricane. With $7 billion in damage caused, it is the 13th costliest hurricane in U.S. History. In Florida the hurricane made landfall in the same area as Hurricane Frances did only two weeks before.

In spring 2005 the name Jeanne was retired because of the severe damage and the high number of deaths. Jeanne was replaced by Julia in 2010.

Redevelopment

Redevelopment is any new construction on a place which is already in use. An example is the redevelopment of a block of small houses into a large apartment.

Articulated vehicle

An articulated vehicle is a vehicle which has a pivot joint. This allows the vehicle to turn more sharply. 

There are many kinds of articulated vehicles: buses, trams and trains may be articulated. Steam locomotives were sometimes articulated so the driving wheels could pivot around turns. In fact, the whole idea of a train is an articulated set of vehicles which run along a track.

Any vehicle towing a trailer could be described as articulated. The term (UK) of "articulated lorry" refers to the combination of a front part which pulls (the "tractor") and a rear part which follows (the "trailor"). In American English, these may be called semi-trailer trucks..

Balloon loop

A balloon loop allows a train to reverse direction without having to shunt or stop. Balloon loops can be useful for passenger trains, and "unit" freight trains, such as coal trains.

Lund University

Lund University is a public university in Lund. It was founded in 1666 and is the second oldest university in Sweden.

Lope de Rueda

Lope de Rueda (1510?, Seville - 1565, Córdoba) was a Spanish dramatist and author. He was regarded by some as the best of his era. A very versatile writer, he also wrote comedies, farces, and pasos. He was the precursor to what is considered the golden age of Spanish literature.


Guillén de Castro

Guillén de Castro y Bellvis (1569 – July 28, 1631), was a Spanish dramatist of the Spanish Golden Age.

Sic

Sic is a Latin word meaning "thus", "so", "as such", or "in such a manner". In writing, it is put in square brackets and italic type – ["sic"] – to show that any incorrect or unusual spelling, phrases, punctuation, or other quoted material have been copied verbatim (word for word) from its original source.

At first, it was said like the English word "seek" (IPA /'sik/); however, it is normally said like the English word "sick" (/'sɪk/).

The word "sic" may be used to show that an uncommon or old usage is written faithfully: for instance, quoting the U.S. Constitution:

It is often used, though, to highlight an error, sometimes to ridicule, such as here in "The Times":

Sometimes, "sic" is said to be an abbreviation for "said in context", "spelled in context", "said in copy", and other phrases. While incorrect, this still gives the same meaning when used.

Warm front

A warm front is a leading edge of a warmer air mass that is advancing into a cooler air mass.

Warm fronts usually have stratus and cirrus clouds, but sometimes they also have cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds. Before the warm front passes, there can be rain or snow. While it is passing, there is often light rain or drizzle.

Warm fronts move more slowly than cold fronts.

On a weather map warm fronts are shown as red lines with red semicircles pointing in the direction that the front is moving.

Groundwater

Groundwater (or ground water) is water found below the surface. It is water that is in empty spaces of soil and rocks. Groundwater starts as rain (or other precipitation), and flows under ground for long periods of time through aquifers. Groundwater flow returns to the surface again through springs and rivers. Groundwater is an important part of the water cycle. Plants take in groundwater through their roots.

People bring groundwater to the surface by digging or drilling wells below the surface. They bring up water from the aquifer and use it for irrigation and other purposes. Some of the dissolved minerals in groundwater are important in the food making process of plants. Rainwater is the main source of groundwater.

Palm Beach County, Florida

Palm Beach County is the largest county by area in Florida. It is one of three counties that makes up the Miami metropolitan area. In 2020 the number of people in Palm Beach County was 1,492,191. The area of Palm Beach County is 2,386 square miles. Palm Beach County was made in 1909. The three largest cities in Palm Beach County are West Palm Beach (117,000 people), the county seat, Boca Raton (97,000 people), and Boynton Beach (80,000 people). The county owns the southeastern area of Lake Okeechobee.

Palm Beach County was made from part of Miami-Dade County in 1909. It was split into more counties later on. In 1915 the southern part of Palm Beach County became Broward County. In 1917 the northwest part of the county became Okeechobee County. In 1925 the northern part of the county became Martin County.









Lake Okeechobee

Lake Okeechobee is the largest lake in the U.S. state of Florida. Lake Okeechobee covers about 730 square miles (about half the size of Rhode Island). The lake is shared by Glades, Okeechobee, Martin, Palm Beach, and Hendry counties. Some cities on the shore of Lake Okeechobee include: Belle Glade, Clewiston, Okeechobee, and Pahokee. 

All I Ever Wanted (album)

All I Ever Wanted is the fourth studio album by American pop rock singer-songwriter Kelly Clarkson. It was released on March 6, 2009 in Australia and Germany. On March 9, 2009 in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. On March 10, 2009 in Canada, Mexico and the United States. And on March 13, 2009 in Italy. It was her second album to debut at #1 on the Billboard Hot 200. That made it Clarkson's second non-consecutive number-one album. "All I Ever Wanted" went Gold in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.

The album was originally going to be called "Masquerade," but the title was changed to "All I Ever Wanted." That was because because Clarkson felt that there were already albums with similar themes then on the charts, such as P!nk's "Funhouse" and Britney Spears' "Circus". "All I Ever Wanted" sold 828,000 copies in the U.S. The album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 52nd Grammy Awards.


Bernard Herrmann

Bernard Herrmann (born Maximillian Herman; June 29, 1911 – December 24, 1975) was an American composer known for writing music for movies.

He won the Academy Award for the movie "The Devil and Daniel Webster" made in 1941.

He also wrote music for many other movies, including "Citizen Kane", "Cape Fear" and "Taxi Driver". He also wrote music for radio drama including works for Orson Welles. He wrote for several fantasy movies by Ray Harryhausen, and many television programs.

Herrmann stated composers like Charles Ives, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Percy Grainger and Max Steiner as influences.

"Note: This is by the date of release, not when they were written"
These works are for a speaker and a full orchestra. These were written to be played over the radio because a human voice would not be able to be heard over the full volume of an orchestra. The 1935 works were written before June 1935.

Turntablism

Turntablism is the art of changing sounds to create music using phonograph turntables and a DJ mixer.

Originally it just meant to pause a track on a record; than developed as technology grew into being able to create a stopping sound effect that only plays when a person cuts a record on a turntable by placing their hand on the record and turning it counterclockwise.

A technique used to put songs together originally only doable by placing multiple records on a turntable then either playing both at the same time in real time stopping, cutting, adding sound effects, or playing one track halfway threw then stopping it and playing the last half of the other track.

They use cutting and splicing techniques, but with the modern technology they can do so much more then a traditional turntable can do, a modern turntable can splice as many songs as you want, you can rewind, fast forward, pause, slow, speed up and add a melody from one song but use the singer from another.

Nadezhda von Meck

Nadezhda Filaretovna von Meck () ( - ) was a rich Russian businesswoman. She is remembered today for her strange relationship with the famous composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. For many years she paid him a lot of money each month so that he could compose. They wrote passionate love letters to one another, yet they never actually met one another.

She also gave financial support to other people in the arts and music, especially to the composers Nikolai Rubinstein and Claude Debussy.

She was born Nadezhda Filaretovna Frolovskaya. Her family owned a lot of land. Her father loved music. Her mother was a very determined business woman.

Nadezhda learned to play the piano and she read many books, learned foreign languages and learned about paintings.

When she was 16 it was arranged for her to marry Karl von Meck, a 28-year-old engineer. Together they had 18 children, of whom 11 grew up to be adults.

Her husband worked for the government. He did not earn much money and the family was growing quickly. Nadezhda wanted her husband to be rich. At this time the steam engine had recently been invented, and railways were just starting to be built in Russia. Nadezhda thought her husband could earn a lot of money building railways. She was right. As an engineer he became responsible for buildings thousands of miles of railroad tracks. The new railways allowed grain to be transported from Central Russia to places like Moscow.
He soon became a multi-millionaire.

Karl died suddenly in 1873. Nadezhda took over his business matters. She sold one railway and controlled the other one with the help of her brother. She kept away from other people, living a solitary life with her children. She was very strict indeed with them, telling them exactly what to do all the time. She did not like the idea of marriage, but realized her children would need to marry. She tried to get them to marry quickly, probably for financial reasons. 

Nadezhda von Meck was very rich and loved music, so she became an important person in Russian performing arts. Several musicians were employed by her in her house. Claude Debussy lived with the family for a time as a music teacher to her daughters. Debussy was a young man at the time, and not yet famous. 

The only concerts she went to were those given by the Russian Musical Society in Moscow. She sat alone where nobody would notice her. She met Nikolai Rubinstein. She thought he had great talent, but she disagreed with him a lot of the time. 

In 1877 she came into contact with Tchaikovsky, although she never met him. She asked him to compose some pieces for violin and piano to play at her home. Tchaikovsky knew she was a rich lady who paid well, so he quickly composed some music. They wrote letters to one another, exchanged photographs of one another, but they came to an agreement that they would never meet. She paid him 6,000 rubles a year. This was a lot of money: about twenty times the salary of an ordinary government worker. He was able to stop teaching at the Moscow Conservatory and spend his time composing. Between 1877 and 1890 they wrote about 1,200 letters to one another. Her encouragement was very important to him, and helped him to keep happy when he felt depressed.

In 1876 Tchaikovsky had decided to marry. He was then a composer aged 36. He was gay, and this was something terrible in Russia at that time. He was very frightened that people would find out and that he would be bullied. So he decided to marry. He did not care who it was he married, so long as it would make him look respectable. The next year he found a young girl called Antonina to marry. He told Nadezhda. She wrote to congratulate him and told him she hoped he would be happy. A week later, Tchaikovsky wrote to Nadezhda to ask for more money because the marriage had put him into debt. A few weeks later he was writing again to her saying that he hated his wife. He soon separated from her. Writing to Nadezhda was a great support to him at this time. It is impossible to know whether Nadezhda knew he was gay or whether that would have made a difference to her feelings. At any rate, she continued to write that she loved him. 

Her relationship with Tchaikovsky was also a good thing for her. She hated anything to do with sex, so it was good that she could express her emotions to someone whom she did not have to face in person. Tchaikovsky dedicated his Fourth Symphony to her.

On one occasion they met one another by accident. Nadezhda had invited Tchaikovsky to stay at her home. This was a huge house in enormous grounds, so it was easy to arrange that they should not meet. They agreed that they would not go out at the same time. However, one day he came home late and she went out early. She was in a horse carriage and he was walking. When they saw one another they looked away quickly.

In October 1890, von Meck sent Tchaikovsky a year's money in advance, saying that it was the last time she would be able to send him money. She said she was bankrupt. She may have worried that she probably would be bankrupt in a year’s time.

Some people think that she did this because she found out about Tchaikovsky’s homosexuality. Others disagree with this. After all, in her last letter to him she asked him never to forget her.

Nadezhda von Meck died from tuberculosis on 13 January 1894 in Nice, France, two months after Tchaikovsky had died.

Clapper (musical instrument)

A clapper is a basic form of percussion instrument. It is made of two long solid pieces that are clapped together to make sound.

Clappers exist in many forms in many different cultures around the world. They can be made of a wide variety of material. Wood is most common, but metal and ivory have also been used.

Sovereign state

A sovereign state is a country with borders where people live, and where a government makes laws and talks to other sovereign states. The people have to follow the laws that the government makes. Most sovereign states are made up of a singular country and nation. However, some states such as the United Kingdom are made up of multiple countries.

Most sovereign states are "recognized" which means other sovereign states agree that it is really a sovereign state. Being recognized makes it easier for a sovereign state to talk to and make agreements (treaties) with other sovereign states. There are hundreds of recognized sovereign states today - see List of sovereign states

There is no rule to say what exactly makes a state. Usually, the things a state must have are mainly political, not legal. The Czechs and the Poles were seen as separate states during World War I, even though they did not exist as states yet. L.C. Green explained this by saying that "recognition of statehood is a matter of discretion, it is open to any existing state to accept as a state any entity it wishes, regardless of the existence of territory or an established government."

This means that it is up to any state that already exists to treat any other group as a state. This recognition can be direct or implied. When a state does this, it usually means that the group will also be treated as a state for things that happened in the past. Sometimes it means that the state wants diplomatic relations with the other group, but not always.
Sovereignty is a word that is often used wrongly. Lassa Oppenheim said that there is no idea whose meaning is more controversial than sovereignty. From the time the idea of sovereignty was first used in political science until now, there has never been one meaning that everyone agreed on. Justice Evatt of the High Court of Australia says that "sovereignty is neither a question of fact, nor a question of law, but a question that does not arise at all." 

Although the word sovereignty often includes all types of government, ancient and modern, the modern state has some links to the type of government first seen in the 15th century, when the term "state" also first meant what it does today. Because of this, the word is often used to refer only to modern political systems.

We often use the words "country", "nation", and "state" as if they mean the same thing; but there are actually differences:


Because the meaning of the words has changed over time and past writers often used the word "state" in a different ways it is difficult to say exactly what a state is. Mikhail Bakunin used the word simply to mean a governing organization. Other writers used the word "state" to mean any law-making or law enforcement agency. Karl Marx said that the state was what was used by the ruling class of a country to control the rule. According to Max Weber, the state is an organization who are the only people allowed to use violence in a particular area.

In 1815 at the Congress of Vienna the Final Act only recognized 39 sovereign states in Europe. Because of this, they said that in future new states would have to be recognized by other states. In practice, this meant recognition by one or more of the most powerful countries.
This constitutive theory was developed in the 19th century to describe what is and is not a state. With this theory, the need to follow international law depends on whether other sovereign governments recognize the group. Because of this, new states could not become part of the international community or be bound by international law immediately, so recognized nations did not have to respect international law in their dealings with them.

In 1912, an expert said "International Law does not say that a State is not in existence as long as it isn't recognised, but it takes no notice of it before its recognition. Through recognition only and exclusively a State becomes an International Person and a subject of International Law".

One of the major issues is the confusion that happens when some states recognize a new group, but other states do not. Hersch Lauterpacht, one of the main people who supported the theory, suggested that it is a state's job to grant recognition as a possible solution. However, a state may use any set of rules when judging if they should give recognition.

One of the criteria most commonly used by micronations is the Montevideo Convention. The Montevideo Convention was signed on December 26 1933 by the United States, Honduras, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Chile, Peru and Cuba but it never received international consensus. The Montevideo Convention has four conditions that a group "should" meet to become a state:


According to this, the existence of a state does not depend upon recognition by other states. Whether or not an group meets the conditions is decided by other states when they decide if they are going to treat that group as a state. Usually, new states are formally recognized by at least a few other states.

Most sovereign states are states "de jure" and "de facto". This means they exist both in law and in real life. However, sometimes states are only "de jure" states. This means that other states see a group as the true government of a place where they have no actual control. Many European states had governments-in-exile during the Second World War which still had relations with the Allies, even though their countries were under Nazi occupation. An example today is the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which is a United Nations observer, has bi-lateral diplomatic relations with 104 states. It has no land of its own, only embassies and consulates. Other states may have sovereignty over a place, but are not recognized by other states, these are "de facto" states only. Many people agree that Somaliland is such a state.

Giza Necropolis

Giza Necropolis (also called the Giza pyramid complex) is a necropolis on the Giza Plateau near the city of Cairo, Egypt. It is about 8 kilometres (5 mi) inland into the desert from the ancient town of Giza on the Nile, and about 25 kilometres (15 mi) southwest of Cairo city centre. The Great Pyramid is the only remaining monument of the Seven Wonders of the World. Construction is thought to have taken 20,000 workers and 20 years.


There have been many theories to explain how the pyramids were built. These theories include:



Yury Luzhkov

Yury Mikhailovitsch Luzhkov () (September 21, 1936 – December 10, 2019) was a Russian politician. He was a member of the United Russia. He became the Mayor of Moscow in 1992, when Gavriil Kharitonovich Popov quit the job since he could not handle the problems that came with it. He resigned in 2010. Luzhkov was born in Moscow. 

Luzhkov died at a Munich hospital from heart surgery-related problems on December 10, 2019 at the age of 83.

Halifax, West Yorkshire

Halifax is a large town in West Yorkshire in England. The town has about 88,000 people living in it. 

Halifax is close to Huddersfield and Bradford. It is near the "spine" of England, the Pennines. It is easy to get to Liverpool and Manchester on the west coast, and Leeds and Wakefield to the East. There is a motorway-standard road which goes over the Pennines. Halifax is on the M1 motorway and the M60 motorways.

The economic booms in Leeds and Manchester, particularly in the financial sector, have led to Halifax becoming a commuter town for these two cities.

Halifax has a historic town centre. There is a lot of Victorian architecture in the town centre. Landmarks include the Town Hall, Piece Hall, the Wainwright monument, the Square Chapel and Halifax Minister. Halifax Station is on the main-line to London, King's Cross Station.

Power Rangers

Power Rangers is a live-action superhero media franchise created by Haim Saban, that is currently owned by Hasbro. The seasons are adapted from Japanese "Super Sentai" shows.

It was owned by Saban Entertainment from 1993 until The Walt Disney Company bought the franchise in September 2001. Disney sold the franchise back to Saban in May 2010. In May 2018, Saban sold the franchise to Hasbro.

In each series, a group of young people gain super powers to protect citizens and fight evil. Throughout the series, the Power Rangers learn the importance of teamwork and perseverance as they battle progressively harder-to-defeat villains. The rangers have a mentor, teaching figure to help lead, and mechanical machines known as Zords to help fight the villains. Each series is connected in the same fictional universe and most series have a theme.



Aditionally, the 2015 indie tactical RPG "Chroma Squad" is inspired by "Power Rangers."

Calzone

A calzone (Italian "stocking" or "trouser" or "drooping sack" or "hanging fold") is a turnover from Italy. It is made with ingredients that are like a pizza, but they are not the same. It is folded into a crescent shape before it is cooked. Calzones are made from pizza dough and filled with mozzarella and ricotta cheese. Other things such as ham, salami, vegetables or an egg can used as fillings as well. The dough is folded over, sealed along the edge and then fried. It is usually served with a seafood sauce, or with garlic, parsley and olive oil.

The Pizza Hut restaurant sells large calzones known as the P'zone. In America, the Hot Pockets brand of microwaveable turnovers are called "Bread Stuffed Calzones".

In Chicago, the calzone is usually called a "pizza puff", made by Italco Foods.


Bisexual pornography

Bisexual pornography is a genre of pornography which generally shows one woman and two men, all perform sex acts with each other. Bisexual pornography is separate from threesome pornography, which shows one man and two women.

As most pornography is marketed to men, most bisexual porn is advertised to straight or bisexual men. Very few customers of bi-porn say they are gay. Producers who use the term "bisexual porn" are usually showing what a bisexual or bi-curious man might wish to see. Sex acts between a man and a woman, as well as between two men. A common way that these are shown in a single scene is with one woman and two men performing together.

Images and videos showing male bisexuality have been more popular since the start of internet pornography. However the area is still a very small grouping of the pornographic DVD market. For example, at porn seller HotMovies.com, there are only 655 bisexual movies out of a showing of more than 90,000 movies. Bisexual DVDs sell much better online than in adult video stores. This may be because customers in stores feel embarrassed to buy them. Most bisexual porn is made by small companies rather than the major studios. Actors are mostly new at porn. Any well-known actors in bisexual porn usually are from the gay pornography industry, although they may not be gay or even bisexual in their personal life.

Heterosexual actors and actresses who have appeared in bisexual porn, for example Kurt Lockwood, have had their sexual orientation doubted, and have been accused by the gay community of being in denial about their homosexuality.

Bisexual pornography may include any of the following:


Soap made from human corpses

During World War II, many people thought that the Nazis were making soap from the bodies of Jewish people who died in the concentration camps.

The Yad Vashem Memorial has said that the Nazis did not make a lot of soap from Jewish bodies. Yad Vashem says that the Nazis used rumors about making soap from bodies to scare the camp inmates. However, there is evidence that research facilities had come up with a way for large amounts of soap to be made from human bodies.

During World War I, the British had already accused Germany of using the fat from human bodies to make things. In April 1917 "The Times" wrote that the Germans were using the bodies of their own dead soldiers to make soap and other products. It was not until 1925 that the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Austen Chamberlain, officially said that the "corpse factory" story had been an error.

Stories that the Nazis made soap from the bodies of concentration camp victims were common during the war. Germany did not have enough fats to make soap during World War II. Because of this, the government took control of making soap.

The "human soap" stories may have started because the bars of soap made by the government were marked with the initials "RIF." Some people thought this stood for "Reichs-Juden-Fett" in German. This means "State Jewish Fat" in English. (In German acronyms, "I" and "J" were often used like the same letter, so people thought "RIF" could mean "RJF".) In fact, "RIF" stood for "Reichsstelle für Industrielle Fettversorgung." This was the German government agency in charge of making and giving out soap and washing products during the war. (In English, the agency's name was the "National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning.") RIF soap was not very good, and did not have any kind of fat.

Raul Hilberg reports that stories about soap made from human fat were told in Lublin, Poland, as early as October 1942. The Germans knew about the stories. Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the SS, got a letter saying the Poles thought Jewish people were being "boiled into soap." The letter also said the Poles feared they would also be used to make soap. These stories were so widely known that some Polish people actually refused to buy soap. Himmler was so worried by the rumors, and the thought of poor security at the camps, that he said that all bodies should be burnt or buried as quickly as possible.

Soviet propagandist Ilya Ehrenburg reported a common version of the story as fact in "The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry":

During the Nuremberg Trials, Sigmund Mazur, a laboratory worker at the Danzig Anatomical Institute, said that soap had been made from the bodies of dead people at Stutthof concentration camp. He said that 70 to 80 kg of fat collected from 40 bodies could make more than 25 kg of soap. He also said that the finished soap was kept by Professor Rudolf Spanner. Mazur gave a recipe that read: ""5 kilos of human fat are mixed with 10 liters of water and 500 or 1,000 grams of caustic soda. All this is boiled 2 or 3 hours and then cooled. The soap floats to the surface while the water and other sediment remain at the bottom. A bit of salt and soda is added to this mixture. Then fresh water is added and the mixture again boiled 2 or 3 hours. After having cooled, the soap is poured into molds."" 

At the Nuremberg Trials, Nazi witnesses and British prisoners of war supported Mazur's story. (The British prisoners of war had been used as forced labor to build the Stutthof camp.) These witnesses talked about seeing:
After doing research, Holocaust survivor Thomas Blatt found little evidence of mass production of soap from human fat. However, he found evidence that soap had been made from human fat in experiments. Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector agrees that the Nazis "did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof," but in small amounts. In his book "Russia at War 1941 to 1945", Alexander Werth said that while visiting Danzig in 1945 just after it was freed by the Red Army, he saw an experimental factory outside the city for making soap from human bodies. Werth said that it had been run by "a German professor called Spanner" and "was a nightmarish sight, with its vats full of human heads and torsoes pickled in some liquid, and its pails full of a flakey substance - human soap".

After the war, in 1955, Alain Resnais included the idea that the Nazis made large amounts of "human soap" in his Holocaust documentary movie "Nuit et brouillard". After the war, some Israelis also spoke about Jewish victims of Nazism with the Hebrew word "סבון" ("sabon", "soap").

Mainstream Holocaust scholars think the idea that Nazis made large amounts of "human soap" is part of WWII folklore. Examples of scholars who believe this include the well-known Jewish historians Walter Laqueur, Gitta Sereny, and Deborah Lipstadt. Other people who believe this include Professor Yehuda Bauer of Israel's Hebrew University, and Shmuel Krakowski, archives director of Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust center. Historian Yisrael Gutman agrees that "it was never done on a mass scale." And Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector says that the Nazis "did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof," but in small amounts.

Today Holocaust deniers use this story to make people doubt the Nazi genocide.

"The Soap Myth" is a 2009 play about Nazis making soap from the bodies of the people they murdered.

Monroe Doctrine

The Monroe Doctrine was a foreign policy of the United States that was proclaimed in 1823 during the presidency of US President James Monroe but had been the idea of Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. It stated that no European power could colonize any more of the Americas or of the Western Hemisphere in general.

In particular, most of the Spanish Empire in South America had recently become independent because of the Napoleonic Wars against France. Having won the Peninsular War, Spain wanted its empire back, which the Monroe Doctrine stated that the United States would resist. The United Kingdom agreed because it wanted to trade with the newly-independent countries and so it helped enforce the Monroe Doctrine by its powerful Royal Navy.

WarGames

WarGames is a 1983 American science fiction thriller teen movie starring Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy and directed by John Badham. The movie follows a computer hacker named David Lightman (Broderick) who breaks into a NORAD war games simulation computer that he thinks is really the computer for a computer game company. Lightman begins a series of events that could start World War III. The movie was nominated for three Academy Awards and was a big hit. It continues to be popular.

The movie begins with two air force officers in a nuclear missile silo who are ordered to fire the missiles in the silo. The officers believe the order to be real and begin to fire the missiles. One of the officers decides not to fire and so the US government replaces all the men in the missile silos with computer control.
David Lightman (Broderick) is a smart high school student and computer hacker that at first limits himself to changing his and a girl whom he likes a lot, Jennifer's (Sheedy) grades from failing to passing grades: Lightman being smart but not motivated at school. A little while later David uses his IMSAI 8080 computer to dial many phone numbers and finds a backdoor into a NORAD war games simulation computer called WOPR (nicknamed the "Whopper"). At first David is looking for new computer games to download and play and believes that the WOPR is actually the computer of a company that makes new computer games. After finding a list of games on the computer decides to play a game. WOPR (who is an Artificial Intelligence computer) asks David for a password and after doing some research on the computer's creator Professor Steven Falken he guesses that the password is named after the creator's dead son, Joshua. After logging in using the correct password, W.O.P.R. believes David to actually be Dr. Falken whom the computer had believed to be dead. The computer (which David now calls "Joshua") asks him if he would like to play a game. David selects the game "Global Thermonuclear War". Doing so starts off a series of events that will end up taking the World into World War III unless it is stopped.

The television news later reports that the USA went on high-alert due to a computer error leading David and Jennifer to wonder if they had caused the problem. David throws away the evidence of his calling Joshua but the computer calls David back. David then asks Joshua if the game it is playing is real or not, Joshua relies "what is the difference?" At this point David learns that Joshua is not a computer game companies' computer but a government one and is actually is playing the game for real. He hangs up but Joshua calls him back, leading David to remove the cord from the back of his telephone. David is then arrested by the FBI and taken to NORAD to answer charges of espionage. David tries to explain that he was not trying to be a spy, but he is not believed. Using things found in the medical office in which he is locked, David escapes from NORAD on a bus load of visitors to the facility. After David escapes he telephones Jennifer (using Phreaking skills) to ask her to buy him an airplane ticket so he can go and see Falken and get his help in stopping Joshua. Jennifer meets him and together then both go off to convince Falken to help them stop World War III.

Professor Falken has in fact resigned from NORAD because he believes war will happen no matter what any one does. Jennifer and David try to convince him to help them explain to NORAD that this is just a game that Joshua is playing. Falken tells them that it is not worth it as it may only buy them a few years but war will still happen. He explains that they are lucky because he lives only a few miles from a primary target and that they will die in a instant. David and Jennifer decide to try to stop the game anyway and try to leave the island. Finding no way off the island since the last ferry has left, Jennifer says that they should "swim for it". David admits he cannot swim. Professor Falken shows up with a helicopter and together they all go to NORAD.

Inside NORAD Falken tells them it is all a game and they decide to allow the missiles that the Soviet Union has reportedly fired to land to see if it is real or a game. The computer screens show the missiles landing but no missiles actually land. This convinces NORAD that the whole thing was not real. Joshua, however, decides to crack the launch codes and fire the USA's missiles for real. David and Falken try to get Joshua to stop the firing and eventually succeed when Jennifer mentions the word "games". After many tries they get Joshua to play tic-tac-toe against itself in an effort to teach it the meaning of (a word meaning that there is no point to doing something, or that doing so will not help). Joshua tries every game of tic-tac-toe possible and then tries the same thing with every scenario within the Global Thermonuclear War game. Joshua then learns that war can not be won, and stops the game ending the threat of World War III.

The movie was a hit. It was nominated for three Academy Awards. The movie had a production budget of $12 million and had gross revenues of over $120 million making it a high earning movie.

"WarGames" has a cult following amongst computer users and fans of the 1980s. The movie led to the development of the term war dialing (the calling of phone numbers looking for computers to connect to and hack).



Disquisitiones Arithmeticae

Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is a book about number theory written by the German mathematician and scientist Carl Friedrich Gauss.

IMSAI 8080

The IMSAI 8080 was an early microcomputer begun in late 1975, based on the Intel 8080 and later 8085 and the S-100 bus. It was compatible with its main competitor, the earlier MITS Altair 8800, by which it was inspired. The IMSAI is largely thought of as the first "clone" computer. The IMSAI machine used a highly modified version of the CP/M operating system called IMDOS. It was designed, made and sold by IMS Associates, Inc. (later renamed "IMSAI Manufacturing Corp"). In total, between 17,000 and 20,000 units were produced from 1975 until 1978.

In May 1972, William Millard began business as "IMS Associates" (IMS) in the area of computer consultancy and engineering, using his home as an office. By 1973, Millard began IMS Associates, Inc. Millard soon found capital for his business, and received several contracts, all for software.

In 1974, IMS was contacted by a client which wanted a "workstation system" that could do jobs for any General Motors new-car dealership. IMS planned a system including a terminal, small computer, printer, and special software. Five of these work stations were to have common access to a hard disk, which would be controlled by a small computer. Eventually product development was stopped. Millard and his chief engineer Joe Killian turned to the microprocessor. Intel had announced the 8080 chip, and compared to the 4004 to which IMS Associates had first used, the 8080 looked like a better idea. Full scale development of the IMSAI 8080 was begun, and by October 1975 an advertisement was placed in the magazine "Popular Electronics", receiving positive reactions.

IMS shipped the first IMSAI 8080 kits on December 16 1975. In 1976, IMS was renamed to "IMSAI Manufacturing Corporation" because by then they were a manufacturing company, not a consultancy one. By October 1979 the IMSAI corporation had gone bankrupt, and the 'IMSAI' trademark was acquired by Thomas "Todd" Fischer and Nancy Freitas (former early employees of IMS Associates), who continued manufacturing the computers under the IMSAI name as a division of Fischer-Freitas Co. Support for early IMSAI systems continues to this day.

The IMSAI 8080 was used for

An IMSAI 8080 and an acoustic coupler type modem were among the hacking tools used by the main character in the 1983 movie "WarGames". However, even by 1983 the acoustic coupler was out of date. It was selected over a more modern model so that the audience would immediately recognize it as the device that connected to the telephone.




Scânteia train accident

The 2009 Romanian bus-train collision (), happened on 14 August 2009 at 14:10pm in Romania. A bus and train hit each other on a level crossing. Forteen people were killed.

This was the worst accident in Romania in the past fifteen years.

The accident happened when a minibus carrying 16 passengers was moving across a level crossing. The minibus was hit by a train as it was crossing the level crossing near Scânteia. Everyone that was killed in the accident was on the bus, which included a child. Two other people were badly injured. The bus was hit in the center of it and was pushed a total of 350 meters by the train The reason why the crash happened in the first place was because the bus driver did not follow the light signals or signs at the level crossing.

Emmett Till

Emmett Louis "Bobo" Till (July 25, 1941 – August 28, 1955) was an African-American boy who was lynched, tortured, and murdered in Mississippi after being accused of offending a white woman in her family's grocery store. The brutality of his murder and the fact of his killers being found not guilty drew many people's attention to the long history of wrongful persecution of African Americans in the United States.

Till was from Chicago, Illinois. He went to see his relatives in the Mississippi Delta area when he spoke to 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant. She was the married owner of a small grocery store. Several nights later, Bryant's husband Roy and his half-brother J. W. Milam, went to Till's great-uncle's house. They took Till to a barn. It is believed that they beat him and removed one of his eyes . They then shot him in the head and put his body in the Tallahatchie River. His body was found in the river three days later.
Till's body was returned to Chicago. His mother wanted on a public funeral service with an open casket. She wanted this to show the world how her son had been killed. Tens of thousands of people went to his funeral or saw his casket. Images of his body were published in black magazines and newspapers. This caused support from both black and white people in the United States. At first, local newspapers and law enforcement officials spoke against the violence and asked for justice. They soon began dealing with national criticism by defending the people of Mississippi. This led to support for the people said to be the killers.

The trial of those accused of killing Till had a large amount of press attention. Bryant and Milam were acquitted of Till's murder. They were not charged with his kidnapping. Months later, when they could not be tried again because of double jeopardy, they said they killed him in a magazine interview. Till's murder is considered an important event leading to the Civil Rights Movement. 
Problems proving that the body was Till affected the trial. This was a part of the reason for Bryant's and Milam's acquittals. The case was reopened by the United States Department of Justice in 2004. An autopsy of the body was done. It was proven to be Till's body. He was reburied in a new casket. His old casket was given to the Smithsonian Institution.

Lactic acid is an acid that is very common in nature. Lactic Acid is a carboxylic acid with a chemical formula of CHO. Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered it in milk that had gone sour, in 1780. Today it is used as an additive to food, to produce a sour taste. Contrary to popular belief, it is not produced in muscles when a person exercises. Lactate, on the other hand, is created within the muscles the more you exercise.

Asylum seeker

An asylum seeker is a person who was forced to flee from their country, due to democide genocide, or mass murder. (endangered) and routed to nearby countries to seek refuge but, is not accepted yet as a refugee. Refugees and asylum seekers are different.

The decision whether a person is a refugee or not is most often left to certain government agencies with the host country. This can lead to a situation where the country will see an asylum seeker neither as refugee nor as legitimate migrant. Then they will be treated as an illegal immigrant (a person who is not a citizen of the country) even if their life was endangered in the country they fled from. 

If a person comes to a country to seek asylum, their refugee status will then be assessed. The government decides whether the person is in danger because of persecution, or if they are just trying to come to that country for free. If a person is not a refugee, they will not have the rights of a refugee. In that case, the government does not have to follow the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.


Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees

The United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is an international agreement that defines who is a refugee. It lists the rights of people who are granted asylum (allowed to live in another country because it is not safe to live in their home country). It also lists the responsibilities of countries that give asylum to refugees. 

The Convention also says which people are "not" seen as refugees, like war criminals. 

The Convention was approved at a special United Nations conference on 28 July 1951. At first, it only talked about protecting European refugees after World War II. There were limits on how long the Convention would last, and who it protected. But in 1967, a "protocol" (change) to the Convention took away these limits. This protocol made the Convention apply to all refugees.

Because the convention was approved in Geneva, it is often called "the Geneva Convention." But it is not one of the more well-known Geneva Conventions that talk about what kind of behavior is allowed during wars.

Denmark was the first state to ratify (agree to) the treaty, on 4 December 1952. Today, 147 countries have agreed to the Convention, the Protocol, or both. (See the map on this page.)

Chapter 1 is made up of Articles from 1 to 11. Article 1 of the Convention as updated by the 1967 Protocol, gives the definition of a refugee: 

This means a refugee is someone who is had to leave their home country because, if they stayed, they would be persecuted (treated badly) because of:

Chapter II is made up of Articles 12 to 16. These talk about:

Chapter III talks about people's rights to work:

Chapter IV talks about refugees' rights to:

Chapter V is made of Articles 25 to 34. These articles talk about the refugees' legal rights:

Derwent Valley Mills

Derwent Valley Mills is the UNESCO World Heritage Site in Derbyshire, England.

The site covers several factory communities which were built in the 18th and 19th centuries in a valley of the River Derwent, upstream from Derby.

Industrial development in the area started with the Silk Mill which was built in Derby in 1721 by John and Thomas Lombe.

In 1771, Richard Arkwright built a water-powered spinning mill at Cromford. In 1776-1777, a larger mill was built nearby. The "factory system "evolved from these two cotton mills. Arkwright's inventions were first put into industrial-scale production.

The workers' housing was near the mills. The mills and houses make up an architectural record of the development of the area.

The changes in the valley, including the creation of workers' housing, were important in the Industrial Revolution.



Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry

The Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry or simply the Très Riches Heures ("The Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry") is a richly decorated Book of Hours. Such books contained prayers to be said by lay faithful at each of the canonical hours of the day. The book was commissioned by Jean, Duc de Berry around 1410. It is probably the most important illuminated manuscript of the 15th century, ""le roi des manuscrits enluminés"" ("the king of illuminated manuscripts"). The "Très Riches Heures" has 416 pages. 131 of them have large miniatures, many more have border decorations or historiated initials. These artworks are among the high points of International Gothic painting, even though they are very small. There are 300 decorated capital letters. The book was worked on, over a period of nearly a century, in three main campaigns, led by the Limbourg brothers, Barthélemy van Eyck, and Jean Colombe. The book is now Ms. 65 in the Musée Condé, Chantilly, France.


Human Development Index

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a number from 0 to 1 (higher is better) used to compare different countries. It is published by United Nations Development Programme. It is used to rank countries into different groups for example developed and developing countries.

The Human Development Index uses different measurements of a population:

The Human Development Index has been criticized. It does not include any ecological considerations. It focuses on national performance and ranking. Its categorisation of 'low', 'medium', 'high' or 'very high' human development countries is suspect.

Economists Hendrik Wolff, Howard Chong and Maximilian Auffhammer think that often the data which is used to construct the statistics for the HDI is wrong. According to them, there are three sources of error in the data:
They found that 11 %, 21% and 34% of countries are currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error. The authors suggest that the United Nations should stop classifying countries into development bins because the cut-off values seem arbitrary. They have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI. 

In 2010 the UNDP reacted to the criticism and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low, medium, and high human development countries. In a comment to "The Economist" in early January 2011, the Human Development Report Office responded to a January 6, 2011 article in the magazine which discusses the Wolff "et al." paper. The Human Development Report Office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the HDI and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by Wolff "et al." in that it generates a system for continuous updating of the human development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place.

The HDI uses a weighted average for the different values. This means that it can be used - to some extent - to compare countries. It cannot be used to show the problems inside a country. Also the index only takes into accounrt people of 20 years or older. This leaves out problems such as infant mortality and children who do not reach that age. 

Economist Bryan Kaplan points out another problem: Things needed in everyday life are underrepresented, education is overrepresented. Unless the whole population is made of students and pupils, it is not possible to reach the maximum score for the education parameter. At the moment, a Scandinavian country is at the top of the list. This means that the HDI measures "how Scandiavian" a country is. It would also mean that the country at the top of the list has no potential for improvement, which is certainly not the case.

The 2011 Human Development Report was released on 2 November 2011. Below is the list of the "Very High Human Development" countries: as suggested above, the list is open to some obvious criticisms. Lichtenstein is just a city, and Hong Kong is not a country.

Rochester New York FC

Rochester New York FC (RNYFC or RNY) is a soccer club based in Rochester, New York, United States. After a hiatus of four seasons, the club resumed play in 2022 as a member of MLS Next Pro, a newly formed league in the third level of U.S. soccer. The league is operated by Major League Soccer and mainly houses MLS reserve sides (made up of younger players developing their skills). RNYFC is the only team in the league that is not owned and operated by an MLS side.

RNYFC was founded in 1996 as the Rochester Raging Rhinos, dropping the word "Raging" in 2008. The club has played in lower-level U.S. leagues throughout its history, mostly at the second level. Before going on hiatus after the 2017 season, it played in the current second level, the USL Championship. Notably, it has been the only team outside MLS to have won the U.S. Open Cup since MLS was formed in 1996, winning that competition in 1999.

A year before the club's hiatus, David and Wendy Dworkin, minority owners of the NBA's Sacramento Kings, became the Rhinos' owners. During the hiatus, the club sought a new stadium site and added funding. In June 2021, English Premier League star Jamie Vardy bought a minority stake in the club. That September, the club renamed itself Rochester New York FC, and soon announced that it would join MLS Next Pro. For at least the 2022 season, RNY will play at John L. DiMarco Field at Monroe Community College in the suburb of Brighton.

The team plays their home games at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia. Other teams named "Whitecaps" have played Association footballin Vancouver since 1974 in the old North American Soccer League, the Canadian Soccer League, and the USL.

The original Vancouver Whitecaps were founded on December 11, 1973. During the 1970s and 1980s, they played in the North American Soccer League (NASL), a soccer league that no longer exists. The Whitecaps achieved success, winning the 1979 Soccer Bowl.

It was during this short time that soccer became popular in Vancouver. The Whitecaps crowds at Empire Stadium grew to sell out crowds, at 32,000 fans per match.

After playing at Vancouver's 32,000-seat Empire Stadium for most of their early years, the team moved into the new 60,000-seat BC Place Stadium in 1983. However, the end of the NASL in 1984 meant the Whitecaps could not longer play in the NASL.

Whitecaps did not play in 1985, but they joined the Canadian Soccer League (CSL) the next year and changed their name to the 86ers. They joined the United Soccer Leagues in 1990, and renamed themselves back to the Whitecaps and then to "Vancouver Whitecaps FC". For the next twenty years, they played in the second level of soccer in Canada, finally ending in 2010.

Now they play in Major League Soccer, which they started playing in during 2011. On October 21, 2012, the Whitecaps became the first Canadian team to make it into the MLS Cup Playoffs. The team was eliminated in the knockout round by the LA Galaxy.

Women's voting rights in the United States

Women's suffrage (the right to vote) in the United States started slowly, at state and local levels, during the 19th Century and early 20th Century, ending in 1920 with the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provided: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex."

Lydia Chapin (Taft) (d. 1778) was a starter of women's suffrage movement in Colonial America. She was the first woman legally allowed to vote in colonial America. After the death of her wealthy husband and elder son, the family was left without an adult Heir apparent. She was given this right by the town meeting of Uxbridge, Massachusetts in 1756. For the great majority of American women, voting rights for women were not granted until much later on.
In 1915, the Justice Bell was taken on a trip, and it was showed, in all 67 Pennsylvania counties, on the bed of a modified pickup truck; The trip was 5,000 miles long; It has been called a "suffrage awareness tour".

Because Susan B. Anthony was important, the United States made a coin; The Susan B. Anthony dollar is a United States dollar coin; It was made (or minted) from 1979 to 1981.

Azua, Dominican Republic

The Dominican city of Azua de Compostela, or simply Azua, is the head municipality of the Azua province, on the south of the country, about 5 km north of the Caribbean coast. It is also called sometimes "Compostela de Azua".

"Azua" is the Taíno name of the region where the old city was founded. In this place, Pedro Gallego (or Pedro Mariscal), a Spanish colonist, developed a farm and he gave it the name of "Compostela" after Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, nortwestern Spain.

The municipality had, in 2010, a total population of 91,345: 46,280 men and 45,065 women. The urban population was of the total population. In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts that are part the municipality. The population of the city of Azua de Compostela without those municipal districts was 59,319.

The town was founded in 1504 by Diego Velázquez, who later went to conquest the island of Cuba; the Spanish governor of the Hispaniola island at that time was Nicolás de Ovando. The town was in the original region of Azua, where there was a Taíno town and Pedro Gallego had a farm. This place is called now "Pueblo Viejo" (in English, "Old Town"), at about 8 km to the soutwest of the modern city.

The first secretary of the town was Hernán Cortés. He lived in Azua from 1504 to 1511, when he left to Cuba and, later, to conquest México.

Several sugar factories were established around the town and pirates came here to get the sugar and other products.

In 1751 there was a strong earthquake that destroyed the old town and a new one was founded on the right (western) side of the River Vía, where the modern city is now.

Because Azua is on the road that goes from the western part of the island to Santo Domingo, the city was destroyed several times during the Dominican-Haitian War (1844-1856). Two important battles (the "Azua Battles") were fought in the city; the first was on 19 March 1844 and the second on 1849.

The municipality of Azua de Compostela is in a very dry valley (the "Azua Valley" or "Azua Plain") where cacti and other plants of dry regions are common. Farming is possible only with irrigation.

The territory around the city is very flat, with only a few very small hills but there are mountains in the north and northwest of the municipality; those mountains are part of the "Cordillera Central" mountain range. The only river in the municipality is the "Vía", a very small river that flows through the city.

Azua de Compostela is at to the west of Santo Domingo. The limits of the municipality are Peralta to the north, Estebanía to the east, the Caribbean Sea to the south, Pueblo Viejo to the southwest and Sabana Yegua to the west.

Azua de Compostela has a subtropical steppe/semi-arid hot climate (Köppen climate classification : BSh).

The average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is . Most rains fall during the end of summer and mainly in fall. The month with the most precipitation on average is October with of rainfall, followed by September with .

Stockton and Malone were firm believers in hard work, and their coach, Jerry Sloan, also strongly believed in working hard in order to compete. Both Stockton and Malone were on the 1992 Dream Team. The Utah Jazz were in the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998 against the Chicago Bulls and their superstar Michael Jordan. Stockton, Malone, and Sloan were all part of the Jazz organization at the time. The Bulls won both of those series.

Stockton retired from the NBA. From start to finish of his NBA career, he stayed with the Jazz.

Tropical Storm Ana (2009)

Tropical Storm Ana was the first tropical storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. It was also the first tropical cyclone to affect the Caribbean during 2009. The storm formed on August 11, but strong wind shear weakened it on August 13. Ana later reformed and became a tropical storm on August 15 before wind shear tore apart the storm again. The storm finally died on August 17.

Between August 15 and 17, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) gave out tropical storm watches to some Caribbean islands like the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. Some people took a few precautions. Most of the damage from Ana was in the form of rain.

A tropical wave formed over the Cape Verde islands on August 9. The NHC started watching the storm to see if it would turn into a tropical cyclone. It became a tropical depression on August 11. By then, the storm had a lot of thunderstorm activity near its center. On August 12, the NHC said that the storm was close to tropical storm-stength. While the storm was still alive, it was not called a tropical storm. However it was later found that the storm had actually reached tropical storm strength winds. The next day, the storm began to weaken and fall apart because of wind shear and dry air. The remains of the storm moved west across the Atlantic Ocean.

On August 14, the NHC saw that the storm was reforming. Later that day, a Hurricane Hunter airplane flew into the storm and the NHC started to follow the storm again. On August 15, the storm was given the name "Ana" after it reached tropical storm strength. Soon wind shear started to affect Ana again. The next day, the storm moved into an area of dry air over the Caribbean Sea. Ana weakened into a depression after another Hurricane Hunter airplane found no tropical storm-winds. The storm's circulation fell apart and Ana finally died on August 17.

On August 15, a tropical storm watch was given to the islands of St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Antigua, Barbuda, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, and the United States Virgin Islands. Later on August 17, Puerto Rico, Dominica, Guadeloupe, St. Martin, and St. Barthelemy were also put on tropical storm watch. When Ana weakened into a remnant low later that day, all watches were stopped.

In St. Thomas, wind speeds from Ana were recorded at 28 mph (45 km/h) and gusts peaked at 40 mph (65 km/h). Also, a lot of rainfall created flooding in Puerto Rico. But there was only little damage done. At most, 4 in (100 mm) of rain fell on the island. Some streets had to be shut down because of the flooding. About 6,000 people lost electricity from the storm. Tree branches broke down power lines. People also reported tornadoes and waterspouts created by Ana in Puerto Rico. The remains of Ana brought rainfall to parts of Hispaniola. But no damage was reported.



Whelk

Whelk is a word used for some marine gastropods. They are found in temperate and tropical waters, and are used by humans as food. The name is properly used for the family Buccinidae, sometimes called the "true whelks".

Whelk is a common name, and used for gastropods of various families. 




True whelks are carnivores and scavengers. They feed on clams, carrion, and sometimes even on detritus. Their sense of smell is very well-developed; they can sense chemical signals from their prey from a considerable distance. Many whelks can bore through the shell of bivalves. Because of this, they can cause harm in oyster farms. Whelks can even attack fish caught in a net by extending their probosces to twice the length of their own bodies.

Consecration

Consecration is a special ceremony, usually religious, in which a person, or an object, or a building, is dedicated to a special purpose. When a new church is built there will be a special opening ceremony, called a "consecration". In many religions ordination is how individuals are consecrated (ordained) as a minister.

The verb is to consecrate. The adjective is consecrated.


The word "consecration" is used in the Catholic Church as the setting apart for the service of God of both persons and objects. The ordination of a new bishop is also called a consecration. The life of those who enter religious orders (for example monks and nuns) is also described as "Consecrated Life". 

In Catholic and Orthodox churches, only men are chosen to be priests. But in many Protestant denominations, including the Church of England, women are allowed take leadership roles. (See Liberal Christianity) Some major Protestant denominations however, like the Southern Baptist Convention take a more conservative and traditional view of women. Various religious groups have different terminology for the recognition of persons who take special roles in the religion. The word "consecration" is sometimes used to recognize persons who would not be accepted for "ordination". 

Tropical Storm Ana

The name Ana was given to six tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean. So far, no tropical cyclone named Ana reached hurricane strength.

Suppressor

A suppressor, often called a "silencer" is a device used to make a gun less loud. Suppressors are most often added to the gun barrel, usually by screwing the silencer onto the end of the barrel. Some guns have a built-in suppressor.

Even though many people use the name "silencer" when talking about a suppressor, it does not really make the gun silent. How much quieter it makes the gun depends both on the cartridges and the suppressor. A suppressed gun usually is between 120 and 135 decibels (dB). This is much quieter than without the suppressor, but is still loud enough to cause hearing loss without protection such as earplugs. An unsuppressed firearm usually produces 140 to 165 dB. For comparison, a typical jackhammer produces about 130 dB.

In many places, suppressors are illegal to own except for the military and police. This is because suppressors make guns quieter and people worry this could help criminals commit crime.

In most states in the United States, suppressors are legal for civilians to own, but the National Firearms Act requires that buyers must go through a special background check and pay a $200 tax. Owning an untaxed suppressor is illegal, except for licensed class 3 firearms dealers, the military, and law enforcement.

MissingNo.

MissingNo., also known as MissingNO, is the name of a glitch Pokémon that is short for "Missing Number". MissingNo. Pokémon are used as error handlers by game developer Game Freak; they appear when the game tries to access data for a Pokémon species that does not exist.

First documented by Nintendo in the May 1999 issue of "Nintendo Power", encountering MissingNo. results in messed up graphics and item duplication of the player's sixth item in their inventory.

There are two reasons why the player encounters MissingNo., both as a result of programming bugs. The first is caused by the way the game stores battle information and the second is caused by the Old Man script in Viridian City. When traveling from one area to another, the game assigns numbers for Pokémon that the player encounters to a data buffer, read by the game when they encounter a wild Pokémon. However, on the right side of the Cinnabar and Seafoam Islands, no data is actually assigned to this buffer, and the information from the previous location is used instead (the player's name data).

Once encountered, players can fight, flee, or capture MissingNo. just like any other wild Pokémon in the game. After encountering the MissingNo., the sixth item's quantity in the player's item menu will be multiplied by 128, and the game's "Hall of Fame" gallery might become damaged forever. Other display problems may happen, though these can be fixed by viewing a Pokédex entry or resetting the Game Boy. It commonly appears as a scrambled "d" shaped rectangle, though sometimes (encounter values) it will look like a Ghost or two fossils.

Even though it has only appeared in three games in Pokémon, MissingNo. has had a lot of impact. Nintendo says it a "programming quirk" and doesn't want players to encounter it and later making impossible to obtain it in the next game, "Pokémon Yellow", unless a trade is done. However, information on how to encounter MissingNo. was printed in a lot of magazines and player's guides due to its effect, while some "Pokémon" players tried to sell real and fake "tips" for capturing MissingNo. for up to $200. In 2009, IGN put MissingNo in their "Top 10 Easter Eggs" in games list, describing it as a "glitchimon" and saying it was useful for making copies of items. In another article, they said "It really says something about "Pokémon" fans that they took what is a potentially game ruining glitch and used it as a shortcut to level up their Pokémon."

Reactions by players to MissingNo. has been studied by sociological studies regarding individuals and games. Sociologist William Sims Bainbridge said in a study that Game Freak "spawned one of the most popular glitches ever in game history", due to the good and bad results of it and players' interesting use of it. The book "Playing with video games" studied the effect of MissingNo. deeply, studying players' curious actions as a result of its appearance and examining their own notes along with individual "sightings" reports, studying and criticizing other people's findings. The book further describes the extent to which gaming communities revolving around "Pokémon" have attempted to make it a real aspect of the game's world through elements such as fan fiction and fan art, adding that this in turn inspires creativity. It also says that people were celebrating and publicizing glitches in the game while trying to make it canon, and adds that MissingNo. popularity was an unusual case.

Dolla (rapper)

Roderick Anthony Burton II (November 25, 1987 – May 18, 2009) was an American rapper and songwriter better known by his stage name Dolla. Burton began his music career in 2000 as a member of the hip hop group Da Razkalz Cru, under the stage name Bucklyte. After he was signed to Akon's Konvict Muzik label in 2007, he released his first single "Who The Fuck is That" featuring T-Pain and Taye Dzim. The song peaked at number 82 on the Billboard Hot 100. There was also an edited version of "Who The Fuck is That", titled "Who The Heck is That". 

He released two other singles until his death: "I'm Fucked Up" in the summer of 2008 and "Make a Toast" (featuring Julian) on November 4, 2008. 

On May 18, 2009, Dolla was shot by 23-year-old Aubrey Lewis Berry in Los Angeles. The two had an argument. Seconds later, Berry shot Dolla in the parking lot of a PF Chang's, a casual dining restaurant. Berry fled and Dolla was taken to a hospital where he later died. 

On May 22, 2010, charges were dropped against Berry for Dolla's death, as he was claiming self-defense. Evidence pointed out that Berry felt threatened by Burton due to a previous altercation in Atlanta a week before the shooting. 

Burton's funeral was held in Atlanta's east point neighborhood on May 23, 2009. He was buried in Westview Cemetery in Atlanta.

The main political party is the Andalusian Nationalists Party but there are also smaller political groups supporting Andalusian nationalism, including "Nación Andaluza" and "Asamblea Nacional de Andalucía".

Bavaria Party

The Bavaria Party (BP) is a political party in the state of Bavaria of southern Germany. It was founded in 1946. The party wants Bavaria to be an independent, separate country, within the European Union. Together with the Christian Social Union of Bavaria it can be seen as an heir to the "Bavarian People's Party" which existed prior to World War II. 

Respect Party

The Respect Party, the Unity Coalition, was a left-wing to far-left political party in the United Kingdom. It was started on 25 January 2004 in London and dissolved on 18 August 2016. Its name was an acronym standing for Respect, Social equality, Socialism, Peace, Environmentalism, Community, and Trade unionism. It was often simply called "Respect". Their first member of parliament was George Galloway. He was the party's leader.

Plaid Cymru (plaɪd ˈkəmri) is Welsh for The Party of Wales. It is often simply called Plaid. It is a political party in the United Kingdom that wants Wales to become its own country. It is described as being on the centre-left or the left-wing of the political spectrum. They have 13 of the 60 seats in the Senedd (as of the 2021 Senedd election), as well as three MPs in the House of Commons (as of the 2019 general election). The party's leader is Adam Price.

Scottish National Party

The Scottish National Party (SNP) (Scottish Gaelic "Pàrtaidh Nàiseanta na h-Alba"; Scots: Scots National Pairty) is a political party in Scotland. It campaigns mostly for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom and become an independent country. It is a social democratic party and is currently the largest party in the Scottish Parliament, with 62 out of 129 seats and its party leader Nicola Sturgeon is First Minister of Scotland.

The Scottish National Party was founded in 1934. During World War II, its leader Douglas Young told Scottish people not to join the war effort and as a result he was widely disliked. The first SNP Member of Parliament was Robert McIntyre, who entered parliament in a by-election for Motherwell in 1945, but he lost the seat at the general election of that year. The party struggled in the 1950s but achieved greater success in the 1960s and in 1967, Winnie Ewing was elected as an MP for the party at a by-election in Hamilton. Only 1 seat was won by the SNP at the 1970 general election but at the February 1974 general election, it won 7 seats. Following the discovery of oil in the North Sea, the SNP ran a campaign called 'It's Scotland's oil' meaning that they thought it should benefit only the Scots and the party won 11 seats and 30% of the vote in Scotland at the October 1974 general election.

When the Labour government of James Callaghan started losing its majority in parliament, it made deals with the smaller parties including the Liberal Party, the SNP and the Welsh nationalists. The SNP only agreed to support this if a referendum was given to the Scottish people on the creation of a devolved assembly. The referendum gained support from 51% of Scots but the Labour government decided that not enough people had voted in the referendum and because of this, the SNP refused to support the Labour government. The general election of 1979 saw the SNP reduced to only 2 seats in parliament.

The party did poorly at the general elections of 1983, 1987 and 1992. Alex Salmond became party leader in 1990 and in 1997, the party won 6 seats in parliament. The Labour government of Tony Blair established a Scottish Parliament in 1999 and at the elections held for the new parliament, the SNP came in second place behind Labour, with 35 out of 128 seats. It wasn't until the 2007 Scottish Parliament election that the SNP made another major breakthrough and at this election, the party won the most seats with 47 out of 128 seats and a minority government was then formed with Alex Salmond made First Minister.

The party tried to give Scotland a referendum on independence in 2010, but the other major parties in the Scottish Parliament stopped them. In 2011, they won 69 out of 129 seats in the election to the Scottish Parliament, and were able to govern alone. They held the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September 2014, where 55% of people voted against independence from the UK. Salmond resigned as First Minister of Scotland and was replaced by Nicola Sturgeon. Under her leadership, the SNP won 56 out of 59 Scottish seats in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom general election, 2015.

The Pussycat Dolls became famous around the world in 2005 with their album "PCD". It reached number five on the U.S. "Billboard" 200 Chart. The album included the hit singles "Don't Cha", "Buttons", and "Stickwitu"; a song that earned the group a Grammy Award nomination. After Carmit Bachar left the group in March 2008, the group continued as a quintet. They made their second album in 2008, "Doll Domination". This album included the singles "When I Grow Up", "I Hate This Part" and "Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)". The group has been criticized for being too sexual in their image and dances. Some people have said they use lead singer Nicole Scherzinger too often; she sings nearly all of the group's lead and background vocals.

Feni River

Feni River (Bangla: ফেনী নদী "Feni Nodi") is a river in the Chittagonian Plains of Bangladesh in the south and eastern of the nation-state. It is a trans-boundary river with an on-going dispute, that dates back to 1958.

Gumti River

Gumti River originates from Dumbur in the northeastern hilly region of the Tripura Division, that is part of the so-called Chittagonian agency.

The Gumti is a hilly river having a strong current. Its flow varies from 100 to 20,000 ft³/s at Comilla. During the rains its average breadth is about 100 m, it is full from bank to bank and the current is rapid. But during the winter it shrinks and becomes fordable at most places. In a year of normal rainfall the river rises to above 1.5 m than the level of the surrounding areas. Flash floods are common phenomena of this river and it occurs at frequent intervals.

Birefringence

Birefringence (or double refraction) happens when light is passed through a special material and it splits into two different rays of light. Calcite crystals and boron nitride are two good examples of materials that cause birefringence. Just as a prism splits light into a large number of colors, birefringence splits light into two images of the same color. You see this as a "double image".

Polymer banknote

Polymer banknotes are banknotes that are made from polymer (plastic). Because they are made of polymer, they last longer without getting ripped or torn, and they contain special security features that make them harder to copy. Polymer banknotes were created by the Reserve Bank of Australia, CSIRO and the University of Melbourne and were first used as money in Australia in 1988. Lots of countries now use polymer banknotes. Seven countries are now fully using polymer banknotes on all of their banknotes instead of paper. It is twice as expensive to make but lasts four times longer than paper banknotes. It is good for countries with lots of humidity, or wet countries, because the notes do not get damaged when it is wet.

Australian pound

The Australian Pound was the money of Australia from 1910 until 1966. It was made up of 20 shillings, with each shilling made out of 12 pence. In 1966, the basic unit of currency was changed from the Australian pound to the Australian dollar which had 100 cents to each dollar. 1 pound became 2 dollars, 1 shilling became 10 cents and 1 penny became 1 cent.

British coins were used until 1910, when Australian silver coins started to be made and used. There were florins, shillings, sixpences and threepences. They had a picture of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom on one side. Australian pennies and half-pennies started to be used the next year. In 1931 gold sovereigns, which had also been used before 1910, stopped being made in Australia. A crown (five shilling) coin was made for use between 1937 and 1938. People did not like them very much so you would not have seen them often after 1940.
By 1966, the coins being used were half pennies, pennies, threepences, sixpences, shillings and florins.

In the early 1800s, some banks printed their own paper money in Australia. The Queensland government and the New South Wales government also made paper money to be used in their states.

The first paper money to be used all over Australia were made by fifteen banks and the Queensland government made between 1910 and 1914. There were 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 Pound banknotes. They had "Australian Note" printed on them. None of the 100 pound notes are known to still exist.
In 1913 the first money to be printed and used by the Australian government were 10 shillings, 1 pound, 5 pounds and 10 pounds. In 1914 20 pounds, 50 pounds, 100 pounds and 1000 pounds were also printed. The 1000 pounds note was such a high value banknote that you could only use them in banks.

In the middle of the 1920s a new 10 shilling banknote (saying "Half Sovereign"), and smaller 1, 5 and 10 pound notes were made. They all had King George V of the United Kingdom on the front.

A new design was printed in 1933 with King George V, also in 10 shillings, 1, 5 and 10 pounds. The notes were changed to have King George VI of the United Kingdom in 1938.

New notes in 1954 came when Queen Elizabeth II became Queen. There were 10 shillings, 1, 5 and 10 pound notes with images of Matthew Flinders on the 10 shilling note, Queen Elizabeth II on the 1 pound note, John Franklin on the 5 pound note and Arthur Phillip on the 10 pound note.

Octane rating

An octane rating is a measurement of how well fuels resist detonation. Modern engines use high degrees of compression. They therefore need fuel that does not detonate easily. Such fuel has a higher octane rating. The rating is done by comparing the fuel to the mixture of iso-octane and heptane that would detonate in the same way. Such a mixture of 90 percent iso-octane and 10 percent heptane has an octane rating of 90. Gas is available with lower octane ratings in the US than in Europe.
The octane rating of gasoline tells you how much the fuel can be compressed before it spontaneously ignites. When gas ignites by compression rather than because of the spark from the spark plug, it causes knocking in the engine. Knocking can damage an engine, so it is not something you want to have happening. Lower-octane gas (like "regular" 87-octane gasoline) can handle the least amount of compression before igniting.

Post-disco

The word "post-disco" refers to late 1970s and early 1980s music and movement of disco music. It has electronic/funk influenced (affected) sounds. Post-disco was invented by DJs and music producers in USA and the UK.

Post-disco music is similar to disco, however, is far more experimental and electronic based. Often composed by DJs or producers, it keeps many of disco's original characteristics, yet, it often incorporates synthesizers or sequencers within its composition.

Post-disco music is a little bit rare, hard-to-find songs can be found for example in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories on fictional radio station Paradise FM.

However, post-disco impact can be heard in styles like house, techno, electro, crunk, dance-rock, italo-disco or dance-pop. 

Post-disco artists include Kashif, Mtume, Unlimited Touch, Kurtis Blow, Patrice Rushen.

Pascal's Wager

Pascal's wager is the name for an idea by Blaise Pascal. He said that it is not possible to prove or disprove that God exists and that when it comes to God’s existence, we are taking a big risk. Pascal thought it is better to bet that God exists, and therefore to live accordingly. If God exists, we could gain a lot, like eternal happiness in Heaven, but if God did not exist it would make no difference. For this reason, it would be better to believe in God, Pascal said. Critics say it's impossible to prove God's existence and that true belief should not be based on what we might gain.

Pascal's argument is that reason and intellect cannot decide the question of whether God exists or not; therefore, it makes sense to choose the option that would benefit us most should we be right, and harm us the least should we be wrong. Accordingly, the options would be : 

1. You may live a religious and moral life and be rewarded by eternal happiness.

2. You may live a pleasure-seeking life and be denied eternal happiness.

3. You may live a religious and moral life, but it makes no difference because there is no God (or eternal life).

4. You may live a pleasure-seeking life, but it makes no difference because there is no God (or eternal life). 

For Pascal, the first option is the most important one, because it represents the maximum gain and [avoids the maximum] loss. Even if it should turn out that there is no God, the risk of deciding against such a possibility means that we should choose that option.

The argument from inconsistent revelations shows we have no idea which hell to avoid since many different religions exist with different beliefs about hell. Within religions there are different denominations and sects with different ideas about heaven and hell. If we try to avoid the hell that Christians believe in we are at risk from the hell Muslims believe. So it goes on. Perhaps God does not like people who accept Pascal's Wager but god may not mind that atheists doubt. Atheists and believers could both be in trouble or neither could be in trouble. 


Pierre de Fermat and Pascal created probability theory. Pascal's Wager was very important for the time, because it did new things with probability theory. It is also one of the first tries to use the concept of infinity, and the first use of decision theory. It was important for other philosophers who developed the ideas of pragmatism and voluntarism.

Pig (dice)

Pig is a jeopardy (risk) dice game played with one die. In jeopardy dice games, a player decides to "roll" or "hold" (stop rolling). A player that rolls risks a turn total, and may gain a higher turn total or score nothing. A player that holds scores the turn total.

John Scarne wrote about Pig as a common dice game in 1945. Optimal (perfect) play has been computed. 
Teachers often use Pig for fun lessons.

On a player's turn, a player can roll or hold:

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

For example, Ann begins a turn with a roll of 5. She could hold and score 5 points, but she decides to roll again. Next, Ann rolls a 2. She could hold with a turn total of 7 points (2 + 5 = 7), but she decides to roll again. Next, Ann rolls a 1 ("pig"). She must end her turn. Her score does not change. She hands the dice to the next player, Bob.

Bob rolls a 4, 5, 3, 5, and 5. He then decides to hold. Bob adds 4 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 22 points to his score.

From 1967 the coins being used were 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents and 50 cents. the 1 cent and 2 cent coins being made of copper and the rest being made in cupro-nickel. In 1987 the 1 cent and 2 cent coins stopped being made and were not used anymore by 1990. In 1991 the 1 dollar and 2 dollar banknotes got changed into coins. They were made of aluminium-bronze.

Hebephilia

Hebephilia is when adults are sexually attracted to people under the age of consent (generally between 12 and 15 years). Adults with this attraction are called "hebephiles" or "hebophiles." The word "hebephilia" comes from Greek: "Hebe" is the Greek goddess of youth, and "philia" means "love". There are media reports of hebephilic acts between female teachers/baby Sitter and young students.

Hebephilia is not a disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. It was a hotly contested debate when the recent edition was created. Some research suggests that hebephilia can be distinguished and diagnosed, and that it occurs more frequently than pedophilia. But many experts argue that the concept lacks valid data, that it counters evolutionary biology, and that the diagnosis would offer a legal loophole to perpetrators sex of criminals .

Hebe

Hebe (; ) is the goddess of youth in Greek mythology. Her parents were Zeus and Hera. Hebe was the cupbearer of the gods, serving them nectar and ambrosia whenever they feasted. Hebe was married to the hero Herakles when he went to Olympus and after their marriage she bore him twin sons Alexiares and Anicetus. Her Roman equivalent is Juventas. 

Ephebophilia

Ephebophilia is when an older adult is sexually attracted to post-pubescent teenagers or adolescents—usually those in the age range 15–19. Adults with this attraction are called "ephebophiles". Ephebophilia is not just the sexual attraction to teenage partners but is when an adult prefers such sexual partners.

Specific words are used by scientists for chronophilias, which is when people are mostly or only sexually attracted to specific age groups. Along with "ephebophilia", another example is "hebephilia", which means that a person is mostly or only sexually attracted to younger pubescent people. The word "pedophilia" means that a person is mostly or only sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children; but the term "pedophilia" is commonly misused to refer to any sexual interest in legally minors under the average legal age of majority of 18 even if they're post-pubescent, and this is also due to the fact that the age of majority (in the states where it is 18 but in other cases it can be higher or lower) and the age of consent are very often confused in the West as the same also due to the fact that in some states they can both coincide (confusion perpetuated also by media, like entertainment and journalism), and this confusion and misuse of the words can cause not only serious cases of ageism but also severe legal repercussions involving slander or/and defamation.

Also, unlike pedophilia, ephebophilia is not classified as a psychiatrist diagnosis or disorder.


The Bash (2009)

The Bash was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on June 28, 2009 at the ARCO Arena in Sacramento, California. This was the sixth show in WWE's production lineage for The Bash event (twentieth overall) and was the first to be referred to as The Bash. It featured talent from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. There were eight matches on for the event's card.


Oblate spheroid

An oblate spheroid is a very famous shape. It is the shape of the Earth and some other planets. It is like a sphere squashed from the top so the circumference around the poles is less than the circumference around the equator. Shapes of this type are called ellipsoids.

Oblate spheroids have rotational symmetry around an axis from pole to pole.

Many planets, including the Earth and Saturn, are oblate spheroids. The difference between a sphere and the Earth's shape is small, only about one part in 300.

Stars spin, and some spin very fast. The faster the spin, the flatter the oblate spheroid. The Sun rotates at 2 km per second, neutron stars have speeds of thousands of km/sec.

In 1687 Isaac Newton published the "Principia". He included a proof that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate ellipsoid of revolution (a spheroid). The amount of flattening depends on the density and the balance of gravitational force and centrifugal force.

In other words, the Earth is a spheroid because it rotates. Gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn are flattened by rotation more than the Earth.

Unforgiven: In Your House

Unforgiven: In Your House was a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was held on April 26, 1998 at Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina. It was the 21st pay-per-view to be held under the WWF's In Your House name. The PPV was also the first to use the "scratch" logo for their promotional work, while WrestleMania XIV featured the logo on the ring apron, the official graphic still featured the New Generation logo. The pay-per-view also held the first ever Inferno Match and WWF's first evening gown match.


Venice and Dalmatia

Venice and Dalmatia were an Italian city-state and an eastern adriatic region very much related from the Middle Ages until the 19th century.

Venice influenced Dalmatia commercially since the times of Charlemagne. But only at the end of the first millennium the Republic of Venice started to conquest Dalmatia.

Indeed, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Illyrian towns on the dalmatian coast continued to speak Latin and their language evolved relatively independent from other Romance languages, progressing toward a regional variant and finally to a distinct language called "Dalmatian language".

The earliest reference on the language dates from the 10th century and it is estimated that about 50,000 people spoke it at that time (according to the linguist Matteo Bartoli).

The Dalmatian language is an extinct Romance language that was spoken along the eastern Adriatic in the Dalmatian coast from Fiume (Rijeka) as far south as Kotor (Cattaro) in Montenegro.

The Dalmatian speakers lived mainly in the coastal towns of Zadar, Trogir, Split, Dubrovnik and Kotor ("Zara, Traù, Spalato, Ragusa" and "Cattaro" in Italian), each of these cities having a local dialect, and also on the islands of Krk, Cres and Rab ("Veglia, Cherso" and "Arbe")

Almost every city developed its own dialect, but the most important dialects we have information on are the "Vegliot" a northern dialect, spoken on the island of Krk ("Veglia" in Italian, "Vikla" in Dalmatian) and the "Ragusan"', a southern dialect, spoken at Dubrovnik ("Ragusa" in both Italian and Dalmatian).

The dialect of Zara disappeared because of the strong Venetian influence while the two other dialects due even to the assimilation by Slavic language speakers.

We know about the dalmatian dialect of Ragusa from two letters, from 1325 and 1397, and other medieval texts, which show a language influenced heavily by Venetian. The available sources include hardly 260 Ragusan words. Surviving words include "pen" (bread), "teta" (father), "chesa" (house) and "fachir" (to do), which were quoted by an Italian, Fillipo Diversi, the head of school of Ragusa in the 1430s.

The "Republic of Ragusa" had at one time an important fleet, but its influence decreased. We know that the language was in trouble in the face of Croatian expansion, as the Ragusan Senate decided that all debates had to be held in "lingua veteri ragusea" (ancient Ragusan language) and the use of the "lingua sclava" (Croatian) was forbidden. Nevertheless, in the 16th century, Ragusan fell out of use and became extinct.

Other languages influenced the Ddalmatian language, but without erasing its Latin roots (superstrates): the Slavs, then the Republic of Venice. Several cities of the regions have Italian names, and other mostly the romanized Illyrian ones (like Zara, Spalato, etc..)

The oldest preserved documents written in Dalmatian are some 13th century inventories, in the Ragusan dialect. A letter of the 14th century from Zara (Zadar) shows strong Venetian influence, which was also the cause of its extinction soon after.

The Christian schism was an important factor in the history of Dalmatia. While the Croatian-held branch of the Catholic Church in Nin was under Pope's jurisdiction, they still used the Slavic liturgy. Both the Latin population of the cities and the Holy See preferred the Latin liturgy, which created tensions between different dioceses.

The great schism between Eastern and Western Christianity of 1054 further intensified the rift between the coastal cities and the hinterland, with many of the Slavs in the hinterland preferring the Eastern Orthodoxy. Areas of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina also had an indigenous "Bosnian Church" which was often mistaken for "Bogomils".

The Latin influence in Dalmatia was increased and the Byzantine practices were further suppressed on the general synods of 1059-1060, 1066, 1075-1076 and on other local synods, notably by demoting the bishopric of Nin, installing the archbishoprics of Spalatum (Split) and Dioclea (Montenegro), and explicitly forbidding use of any liturgy other than Greek or Latin.

Dalmatia never attained a political or racial unity and never formed as a "nation", but it achieved a remarkable development of art, science and literature. Politically, the neolatin Dalmatian city-states were often isolated and compelled to either fall back on the Venetian Republic for support, or tried to make it on their own.

The geographical position of the Dalmatian city states suffices to explain the relatively small influence exercised by Byzantine culture throughout the six centuries (535-1102) during which Dalmatia was part of the Eastern empire. Towards the close of this period Byzantine rule tended more and more to become merely nominal, while the influence of the Republic of Venice increased.

The medieval Dalmatia had still included much of the hinterland covered by the old Roman province of Dalmatia. However, the toponym of "Dalmatia" started to shift more towards including only the coastal, Adriatic areas, rather than the mountains inland. By the 15th century, the word "Herzegovina" would be introduced, marking the shrink of the borders of Dalmatia to the narrow littoral area where was spoken the Dalmatian language (that was being assimilated into the venetian language).

In the thirteenth century the Republic of Venice took definitive control of the Montenegro coast and created the "Albania Veneta".

As the city states gradually lost all protection by Byzantium, being unable to unite in a defensive league hindered by their internal dissensions, they had to turn to either Venice or Hungary for support. Each of the two political factions had support within the Dalmatian city states, based mostly on economic reasons.

The Venetians, to whom the Dalmatians were already bound by language and culture, could afford to concede liberal terms as its main goal was to prevent the development of any dangerous political or commercial competitor on the eastern Adriatic.
The seafaring community in Dalmatia looked to Venice as mistress of the Adriatic. In return for protection, the cities often furnished a contingent to the army or navy of their suzerain, and sometimes paid tribute either in money or in kind. Arbe (Rab), for example, annually paid ten pounds of silk or five pounds of gold to Venice.
Hungary, on the other hand, defeated the last Croat king in 1097 and laid claim on all lands of the Croatian noblemen since the treaty of 1102. King Coloman of Hungary proceeded to conquer Dalmatia in 1102-1105.
The farmers and the merchants who traded in the interior favoured Hungary as their most powerful neighbour on land that affirmed their municipal privileges.
Subject to the royal assent they might elect their own chief magistrate, bishop and judges. Their Roman law remained valid. They were even permitted to conclude separate alliances. No alien, not even a Hungarian, could live in a city where he was unwelcome; and the man who disliked Hungarian dominion could emigrate with all his household and property. In lieu of tribute, the revenue from customs was in some cases shared equally by the king, chief magistrate, bishop and municipality.

These rights and the analogous privileges granted by Venice were, however, too frequently infringed. Hungarian garrisons were being quartered on unwilling towns, while Venice interfered with trade, the appointment of bishops, or the tenure of communal domains. Consequently, the Dalmatians remained loyal only while it suited their interests, and insurrections frequently occurred. Even in Zara four outbreaks are recorded between 1180 and 1345, although Zadar was treated with special consideration by its Venetian masters, who regarded its possession as essential to their maritime ascendancy.

The once rival Romanic and Slavic population eventually started contributing to a common civilization, and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) was the primary example of this. By the 13th century, the councilmen from ragusan names were mixed, and in the 15th century the ragusan literature was even written in the Slavic language (from which Croatian language is directly descended), and the city was often called by its Slavic name, Dubrovnik. Only in 1918 Ragusa was called officially "Dubrovnik", with the creation of Yugoslavia.

The doubtful allegiance of the Dalmatians tended to protract the struggle between Venice and Hungary, which was further complicated by internal discord due largely to the spread of the "Bogomil heresy", and by many outside influences.

The cities of Zara (Zadar), Spalato (Split), Trau (Trogir) and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) and the surrounding territories each changed hands several times between Venice, Hungary and the Byzantium during the 12th century.

In 1202, the armies of the Fourth Crusade rendered assistance to Venice by occupying Zadar for it. In 1204 the same army conquered Byzantium and finally eliminated the Eastern Empire from the list of contenders on Dalmatian territory.

The early 13th century was marked by a decline in external hostilities. The Dalmatian cities started accepting foreign sovereignty (mainly of the Republic of Venice) but eventually they reverted to their previous desire for independence. The Mongol invasion severely impaired Hungary, so much that in 1241, the king Bela IV had to take refuge in Dalmatia (in the Klis fortress). The Mongols attacked the Dalmatian cities for the next few years but eventually withdrew.

The Croats were no longer regarded by the city folk as a hostile people, in fact the power of certain Croatian magnates, notably the counts Šubić of Bribir, was from time to time supreme in the northern districts (in the period between 1295 and 1328).

In 1346, Dalmatia was struck by the Black Death. The economic situation was also poor, and the cities became more and more dependent on Venice.

Stephen Tvrtko, the founder of the "Bosnian kingdom", was able in 1389 to annex the Adriatic littoral between Cattaro and Sebenico (Šibenik), and even claimed control over the northern coast up to Fiume (Rijeka) except for the Venetian-ruled Zara (Zadar), and his own independent ally, Ragusa (Dubrovnik). This was only temporary, as the Hungarians and the Venetians continued their struggle over Dalmatia as soon as Tvrtko died in 1391.

An internal struggle of Hungary, between King Sigismund and the Neapolitan house of Anjou, also reflected on Dalmatia: in the early 15th century, all Dalmatian cities welcomed the Neapolitan fleet except for Dubrovnik (Ragusa). The Bosnian duke Hrvoje controlled Dalmatia for the Angevins, but later switched loyalty to Sigismund.

Over the period of twenty years, this struggle weakened the Hungarian influence. In 1409, Ladislaus of Naples sold his "rights" over Dalmatia to Venice for 100,000 "Ducats". Venice gradually took over most of Dalmatia by 1420. In 1437, Sigismund recognized Venetian rule over Dalmatia in return for 100,000 Ducats. The city of Omiš yielded to Venice in 1444, and only Ragusa (Dubrovnik) preserved temporarily its freedom.

The rule of Venice on most of Dalmatia will last nearly four centuries (1420 - 1797).

During the Venetian rule in Dalmatia from 1420 to 1797 the number of Orthodox Serbs in Dalmatia was increased by numerous migrations.

An interval of peace ensued, but meanwhile the Ottoman advance continued.

Hungary was itself assailed by the Turks, and could no longer afford to try to control Dalmatia. Christian kingdoms and regions in the east fell one by one, Constantinople in 1453, Serbia in 1459, neighbouring Bosnia in 1463, and Herzegovina in 1483. Thus the Venetian and Ottoman frontiers met and border wars were incessant.

Dubrovnik sought safety in friendship with the invaders, and in one particular instance, actually sold two small strips of its territory (Neum and Sutorina) to the Ottomans in order to prevent land access from the Venetian territory.

In 1508 the hostile "League of Cambrai" compelled Venice to withdraw its garrison for home service, and after the overthrow of Hungary in 1526 the Turks were able easily to conquer the greater part of Dalmatia by 1537. The peace of 1540 left only the maritime cities to Venice, the interior forming a Turkish province, governed from the fortress of Klis by a "Sanjakbeg" (an administrator with military powers).

Christian Croats from the neighbouring lands now thronged to the towns, outnumbering the Romanic population even more, and making their language the primary one. The pirate community of the "Uskoks" had originally been a band of these fugitives, especially near Segna (Senj); its exploits contributed to a renewal of war between Venice and Turkey (1571-1573). An extremely curious picture of contemporary manners is presented by the Venetian agents, whose reports on this war resemble some knightly chronicle of the Middle Ages, full of single combats, tournaments and other chivalrous adventures. They also show clearly that the Dalmatian levies far surpassed the Italian mercenaries in skill and courage. Many of these troops served abroad; at the Battle of Lepanto, for example, in 1571, a Dalmatian squadron assisted the allied fleets of Spain, Venice, Austria and the Papal States to crush the Turkish navy.

The continental bits of Dalmatia were under Ottoman rule, parts of the Viyalet of Bosnia or the Klis Sanjak. The desolated areas of the Knin Frontier and Bukovica were inhabited by Orthodox Serbs from Bosnia, while the Albania veneta received constant Serb migrations from Herzegovina and Montenegro. The Serbs formed one quarter of Dalmatia's population in the 16th century. They had absolute majority in the Knin Frontier, Bukovica and the Cattaro area. The Ottomans have resettled this populace to create a living defence towards the territories of the Venetian Republic. A great portion of this population fled to Venetian land and gladly fought against the Ottomans. The number of Serbs in Venetian Dalmatia rapidly increased during the War of Crete in 1645 - 1669 and the Great Viennese War in 1683 - 1699, after which the "Peace of Karlowitz" gave the whole of Dalmatia and coastal Montenegro (from Sutorina to Cattaro) to the Venetian Republic. After the Venetian-Turkish war of 1714-1718, Venetian territorial gains were confirmed by the 1718 "Treaty of Passarowitz". The number of Dalmatian Serbs remained between "20%" and "25%" by the end of Venetian rule, while the venetian speaking population in the Dalmatian cities and islands increased with colonists from north-east Italy.

The Serbian peasant population of infertile Upper Dalmatia was freed of "Feudal bonds", according that they fight wars for the Venetian Republic. The Serbs living in urban area of cities in Dalmatia were much wealthier. The Serbs in Dalmatia with Boka have had strong national and religious determination through numerous old monasteries as beacons of culture and faith. Such were the early 14th century Krupa, Krka and Dragović monasteries in the Knin Frontier and Bukovica. The Serbs in the area of Cattaro (Kotor) had much more cultural advancement due to the nearby Cetinje capital area, and the Venetians had to fall back from influencing the religious life of people there.

Dalmatia was the largest Europe's concentration of Roman Catholic Bishops, Priesthood, Churches, Monasteries and religious institutions. The Catholic Bishops controlled the Orthodox Episcopy in Dalmatia by naming the Eastern Othodox Christian Episcopes themselves.

Dalmatia experienced a period of intense economic and cultural growth in the 18th century, given how trade routes with the hinterland were reestablished in peace. Christians that noticeably migrated from the Ottoman-held territory into the Dalmatian cities converted from Orthodoxy to Catholicism.

Because the Venetians were able to reclaim some of the inland territories in the north during the Turkish wars, the region of Dalmatia was no longer restricted to the coastline and the islands. However, the Venetian influence wasn't as strong in the former southern Dalmatia, meaning that the toponym did not extend inland into areas of Herzegovina or Montenegro.

This period was abruptly interrupted with the fall of the Venetian republic in 1797.

Napoleon united for the last time Dalmatia and Venice in his "Kingdom of Italy" in 1805. After his fall Venice followed the history of Italy with the Risorgimento, while Dalmatia was aggregated to the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Derby Carriage and Wagon Works

Derby Carriage and Wagon Works was built by the Midland Railway. They built it in Derby, England

The building began at Derby Works in 1840. This was when the North Midland Railway, the Midland Counties Railway and the Birmingham and Derby Railway made engine sheds for their Tri Junct Station. These three merged in 1844 to form the Midland Railway. Then, its first Locomotive and Carriage Superintendent Matthew Kirtley decided to organise their works and persuaded that the railway should build their own rolling stock instead of than buying it.

Viscosity index

Viscosity index or VI is measure of the temperature at which a lubricating oil works properly. The VI scale goes from 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst, and 100 being the best. New products are now better than when the scale was first made, so some new products have scores as high as 400.

Lubricating oil is meant to reduce friction between two surfaces. If it is too viscous the oil will be thick and sticky and need too much energy to keep the parts moving. If the oil is too thin, then the parts will rub together and create friction. What is needed is an oil that has just the right amount of viscosity to keep the two surfaces apart. Oil becomes less viscous as the temperature goes up. In an automobile engine, the oil needs to be viscous at a range of temperatures. It needs to work when the engine is first started and is cold, and keep working when the engine gets very hot, perhaps as much as 200 °C. The best oils, with a high viscosity index score, will keep their viscosity the same across the temperature range.

The scale was made up by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).

WWE Breaking Point

Breaking Point was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which took place on September 13, 2009 at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It contained wrestlers from the Smackdown, ECW, and RAW brands. The name of the event was voted by fans via WWE's official website. Breaking Point was chosen over Submission Sunday, Total Submission, and Submit & Quit.
Breaking Point contained seven professional wrestling matches, with the three main event matches being held under submission rules. The event involved wrestlers from all three Brands, Raw, WWE SmackDown and ECW. The wrestlers portrayed either a good guy or a bad guy as they followed a series of events which led to a wrestling match or a series of wrestling matches.

On the August 24, 2009 edition of WWE Raw, the main event for the Raw brand was announced, it was to be a rematch from the previous nights SummerSlam PPV, Randy Orton would again defend the WWE Championship against John Cena. Due to the controversy surrounding the previous nights match, which involved the match being restarted due to a disqualification, count-out and Orton's use of illegal leverage.

Vince McMahon granted Cena a rematch as a result of Orton's actions, in a response to the interference from Brett DiBiase at SummerSlam, McMahon stated if anyone were to interfere on Orton's behalf he would lose the WWE Championship. The Championship was defended in an "I Quit" match, where the opponent is won by making the opponent say "I Quit".

After winning the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, it was announced CM Punk would defend the Championship the following week on the August 28, 2009 (taped August 25, 2009) edition against Jeff Hardy and the winner would face The Undertaker at Breaking Point in a Submission match, where the only way to win is by making your opponent Submit.

On the August 24, 2009 edition of WWE Raw, the Guest host for the night was weltherweight boxing champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr. who previously had a match with The Big Show at WrestleMania XXIV in 2008. Due to lingering bitterness from their WrestleMania match, Mayweather announced an exhibition match between Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Mark Henry versus Unified Tag Team Champions Big Show and Chris Jericho, with an added stipulation that if MVP and Henry won they would face Show and Jericho for the Unified Tag Team Championship at Breaking Point. During the match MVP and Henry gained their chance when Mayweather handed MVP brass knuckles to knock Jericho out and pin Jericho for the win.

On the July 27, 2009 edition of Raw, to decide the opponent for the current WWE Champion Randy Orton at Night of Champions, a "beat the clock" challenge was set up, Triple H had to defeat his opponent Cody Rhodes in under a set time of 6 minutes and 49 seconds set by Mark Henry. Triple H was unsuccessful in his attempt, this match was followed by Rhodes with assistance from The Legacy team member Ted DiBiase beating down Triple H. This event led to Triple H seeking help from Shawn Michaels to reform the group, D-Generation X (DX), to face and beat Rhodes and DiBiase at SummerSlam. Following the weeks of SummerSlam DX was continuously beat down by The Legacy which resulted in an announcement on WWE.com that the two teams would face at Breaking Point, in a Submissions Count Anywhere match.

In Your House

In Your House was a pay-per-view (PPV) series made by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).

The original idea was in months where the WWF was not producing a major PPV event (WrestleMania, King of the Ring, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Royal Rumble which ran for three hours) they would produce a two hour PPV event for a lower price of $19.95.

When World Championship Wrestling (WCW) started producing three hour PPV's on a monthly basis, the WWF was forced to drop the concept.

The events were numbered numerically (example: In Your House #1, #2) until In Your House #7 where specific subtitles were added which usually referred to the main event, starting with In Your House #7: Good Friends, Better Enemies (refers to the Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel match).

Gradually the subtitles became "In Your House" (example: Unforgiven: In Your House). Current PPV's No Way Out, Backlash, Judgment Day and Unforgiven all came from the In Your House series.

Albania veneta

Albania Veneta (English: "Venetian Albania") was the name for the possessions of the Republic of Venice in southern Dalmatia from 1420 to 1797.

It originally covered the coastal area of what is now northern Albania and the coast of Montenegro, but the Albanian and southern Montenegrin parts were lost to the Ottomans in 1571.

The word "Veneta" in "Albania Veneta" was used to differentiate the area from the Ottoman Albania (called "Albania Ottomana" in those centuries), an area stretching from Kosovo to southern Albania.

These Venetian possessions stretched from the southern borders of the "Republic of Ragusa" (modern-day Dubrovnik) to Durazzo (Durrës) in coastal Albania. The Venetian territories never reached more than 20 km from the Adriatic Sea. After 1573 the southern limit was moved to the village of Confin (Kufin) near Budua (Budva), because of the Ottoman conquests of Antivari (Bar), and Dulcigno (Ulcinj) in the Balkans.

The Dominions of Venice were centered around the "Bocche di Cattaro" (Bay of Kotor) and included the small cities of Cattaro (Kotor), Risano (Risan), Perasto (Perast), Teodo (Tivat), Castelnuovo (Herceg Novi), Budua (Budva) and Spizza (Sutomore).

Venice started to take control of the small southern Dalmatian villages around the 10th century, assimilating quickly the neolatin "Dalmatian language" of the coastal areas into the Venetian language. But only in the 14th century was the Republic of Venice able to create a territorial continuity around the Bay of Kotor. These Venetian dominions around Cattaro (Kotor) lasted from 1420 to 1797 and were called "Albania Veneta", a historical province of the Republic of Venice.

When the Turks started to conquer the Balkans in 15th century, many Christian Slavs took refuge inside Venetian Dalmatia and so even the "Albania Veneta" started to have a huge Serb and Albanian population. By the end of 17th century the Romance speaking population of the historical "Albania Veneta" was already a minority, according to Oscar Randi in his book ""Dalmazia etnica, incontri e fusioni".

After the Napoleonic armies conquered and put an end to the Republic of Venice in 1797, the area of the Albania veneta changed control many times:
in 1805 was annexed to the Napoleonic "Kingdom of Italy", then in 1809 was part of French "Illyrian Provinces" and finally in 1815 was put under Habsburg control in the Dalmatia of the Austrian Empire.

Under the Habsburg domination, "Albania Veneta" was part of "Austrian Dalmatia" and in 1878 (at the "Congress of Berlin") another 40 km² around Sutomore were added to this territory.

The borders of the former Venetian province of "Albania Veneta" changed again in 1918, when was created the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, but were reinstated from 1941 to 1943 during World War II, when Mussolini annexed the territories around Cattaro to the Kingdom of Italy. The area was part of the Italian "Governatorato di Dalmazia" and was called "Provincia di Cattaro".

After World War II any political entity related to the historical presence of Venice in southern Dalmatia ceased to exist and the area was definitely incorporated into Yugoslavia.
The old "Albania Veneta" is currently a coastal region of the newly independent Montenegro.

According to the Dalmatian historian Luigi Paulucci (in his book "Le Bocche di Cattaro nel 1810") the population of the "Albania Veneta", during the centuries of the Republic of Venice, was mainly Venetian speaking (approximately 66%) in the urban areas (Cattaro, Perasto, Budua, ecc..) around the "Bocche di Cattaro" (Bay of Kotor).

But in the inland areas more than half of the population was Serbo-Croatian speaking, after the first years of the eighteenth century. Paulucci wrote even that near the border with Albania there were big communities of Albanian speaking people: Dulcigno (Ulcinj) was half Albanian, one quarter Venetian and one quarter Slavic-speaking.

During the French rule of the area of Cattaro the schools were in Italian, when the former Albania Veneta was part of the Napoleonic "Kingdom of Italy". 

The Slovenian Marko Trogrli in his essay "The French school system in French Dalmatia" wrote that "Vincenzo Dandolo, the French governor of Dalmatia as well as Bartolomeo Benincasa, an official from the local (Dalmatian) Education Department, published in May 1807 a plan for the province's public education ("Il piano generale della pubblica istruzione in Dalmazia"), which had to be consistent with the education system throughout the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy...Instruction was to be in Italian".

During the nineteenth century, according to the historian Scaglioni Marzio, the wars of independence of Italy from the Austro-Hungarian empire created a situation of harassment against the Italian (or Venetian speaking) communities in the Austrian southern Dalmatia.

The result was that in 1880 there were in Cattaro, according to the Austrian census, only 930 ethnic Italians (or only 32% of a total population of 2910 people).

Furthermore, in the Austrian census of 1910, the Italians were reduced to only 13.6% in that city, according to Diego De Castro in his book "Dalmazia, popolazione e composizione etnica. Cenno storico sul rapporto etnico tra Italiani e Slavi nella Dalmazia".

There are currently 500 Italian speakers in Montenegro, mainly in the area of Cattaro (Kotor) and Perasto (Perast), who constitute the "Comunitá Nazionale Italiana del Montenegro".

The "disappearance" of the Italian speaking populations in Dalmatia was nearly complete after World War II. The linguist Matteo Bartoli calculated that the Italians were 33% of the Dalmatian population during the Napoleonic wars, while currently there are only 300 Italians in Croatian Dalmatia and 500 Italians in coastal Montenegro.

Heliantheae

Heliantheae is the most well known tribe of the sunflower family (Asteraceae). The name comes from the Greek word for "sun flower". The Heliantheae is the third largest tribe in the sunflower family, which has 190 genera and about 2500 species. Only the tribes Senecioneae and Astereae are larger. Most Heliantheae come from North America and South America, and Mexico. A few genera come from tropical areas.

Most Heliantheae are herbs or shrubs, but there are some that grow to the size of small trees. Leaves are usually hairy and arranged in opposite pairs. The anthers are usually black.

Heliantheae can be grown on farms. These include sunflowers and jerusalem artichokes. Many garden flowers are also in this group, such as "Coreopsis", "Cosmos", "Echinacea", "Rudbeckia", and "Zinnia".

There are also some weeds in the family. Species of "Ambrosia" (ragweed) produce lots of pollen. Each plant can produce about a billion grains of pollen over a season, and the plant is wind-pollinated. It is one of the main causes of hay fever.

In 1981 Harold Ernest Robinson came up with a new way to describe the tribe. He divided Heliantheae into 35 subtribes:

Borderline personality disorder

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a long-term mental illness. It is a type of cluster B personality disorder. People diagnosed with it are often very impulsive, and generally have low self-esteem. Moods often change quickly. For these reasons, these people often have trouble keeping a stable relationship. Frequently, people with BPD also suffer from other conditions, such as clinical depression or they show self-harming behavior. Treating people with BPD is difficult, and is usually done using a combination of therapy and drugs.

C.H.Huges used the term "Borderland", to describe a number of conditions bordering mental health issues. Adolf Stern described of some of the symptoms in 1938, and called them "border line group". People showed both conditions related to psychosis, and related to neurosis, so the term was thought fitting, at the time.

People diagnosed with BPD have strong mood swings. They see things as "all good" or "all bad" (splitting), and are frequently confused about their identity. They usually have a lot of trouble with relationships with people. They have strong emotions which often change quickly. They are often reckless, destructive or self-destructive.

People with BPD feel emotions more easily, more deeply and for longer than others do. Emotions may repeatedly return and last a long time. Because of this, it may take longer than normal for people with BPD to return to a normal and stable emotional state. This can have both positive and negative effects. People with BPD often switch between being loving and happy and being sad and angry. They feel emotions in a stronger way than most people - grief instead of sadness, rage instead of being annoyed, and panic instead of being anxious. People with BPD are especially sensitive to feelings of being abandoned, being alone, and being a "failure". They are often aware of how strong their emotions are, and, since they cannot control them, they sometimes shut them down entirely.

Their emotions are intense and their emotions are also quick to change. The most common mood swings they have are between anger and anxiety and between depression and anxiety.

People with BPD often act impulsively, which means they do things or say things without thinking. This behavior can be dangerous, and includes: abusing drugs or alcohol, eating too much or too little, having unsafe sex or frequent sex with multiple partners, spending a lot of money, and driving dangerously. Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away, and self-injury.

People with BPD sometimes act impulsively because it gives them instant relief from their emotional pain. However, in the long term, people with BPD go through more pain from the shame and guilt that follow these actions. A cycle often begins where people with BPD feel emotional pain and act impulsively to relieve that pain. Then they feel bad about what they did, and have strong urges to act impulsively to relieve the new pain. As time goes on, impulsive behavior may start to be an automatic reaction to emotional pain.

Self-injury is common for people with BPD. Sometimes people hurt themselves without wanting to commit suicide. Common methods include cutting, burning, head banging, and drug overdose. The reasons people with BPD give for non-suicidal self-injury are different from their reasons for suicide attempts. Reasons they give for hurting themselves include expressing anger, punishing themselves, creating normal feelings, and distracting themselves from emotional pain or difficult situations. When suicide is the goal, they usually attempt suicide with the belief that others will be better off without them. Both suicidal and non-suicidal self-injury are a response to feeling negative emotions.

People with BPD can be very sensitive to the way others treat them. They can feel very happy and grateful when they feel someone has been nice to them, and very sad or angry when they feel someone has been hurtful to them. Their feelings about others often switch from positive to negative if they feel like they might lose someone, if they think someone important to them does not care about them, or if something is not as good as they expected. They think in extremes, seeing things or people as "all good" or "all bad". This is sometimes called black-and-white thinking. It includes a change from admiring someone to devaluing them, often feeling pure anger or dislike. The way they see themselves can also change quickly from positive to negative.

While strongly wanting to feel closeness, people with BPD tend to be anxious, have mixed feelings, or be paranoid when it comes to their relationships. They often view the world as dangerous and bad. BPD is linked to high levels of stress and conflict in romantic relationships, abuse, and unwanted pregnancy. These things are also common with other types of personality disorders.

People with BPD tend to have trouble seeing a clear picture of their identity. It is difficult for them to know what they value and love. They often do not know about their long-term goals for relationships and jobs. They often have trouble making decisions and can change their minds quickly. These difficulties can cause people with BPD to feel "empty" and "lost".

People with BPD are easily bored and it is hard for them to concentrate. People with BPD may tend to disconnect or "dissociate" from people and things around them, which can be thought of as an intense form of "zoning out". This often happens in response to a painful event, or something that triggers the memory of a painful event. This can give make the person feel better for a short time, it can also have the unwanted side effect of blocking ordinary feelings. This has the result of keeping people with BPD from learning how to handle these feelings, and can make it difficult for them to make positive choices when they feel these emotions. Sometimes other people can see when someone with BPD is dissociating because the expressions in their voice or face can seem emotionless, or they look like they are distracted. Sometimes when someone with BPD is dissociating, other people are not able to see or know that it is happening.

Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals diagnose people with BPD using a book called the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" (DSM-IV-TR). They look at a person's behaviour and how they are feeling. If the person has five or more of the following signs, the DSM-IV-TR says that they have BPD.


Nearly all people with BPD also have other mental health problems, such as: mood disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, anxiety disorders (especially post-traumatic stress disorder), and other personality disorders including Haltlose personality disorder. 

Some struggle with substance abuse and/or addictions. Self-harm and suicidal behavior are also common.

Other illnesses that often happen with BPD include diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic back pain, arthritis, and fibromyalgia.

The cause for BPD is not known. There may be several causes for people developing BPD. Some researchers think that it might be caused by trauma in childhood, such as sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect. Many people with BPD were abused when they were children. Modern thinking as demonstrated by functioning MRI scans is that neurotransmitters within the brain are not working correctly, and messages are not conducted in the usual way. 

Some studies of twins and families suggest that personality disorders may be inherited or strongly associated with other mental health disorders among family members.

Some factors related to personality development can increase the risk of developing borderline personality disorder. These include:


Treating BPD is very difficult and takes a long time. Today, most people with BPD are treated with different kinds of psychotherapy. One of these is called dialectical behavioral therapy. In addition to therapy, drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics or mood stabilizers are often used. Many sufferers recover within 10 years.


Personality disorder

A personality disorder (PD) or character disorder is a type of disorder where a person thinks, feels and behaves differently from how society expects them to. Where these traits would be flexible in most people, these traits are rigid and unworkable in someone with a personality disorder and create lasting patterns and often lasting problems. These thoughts, feelings and behaviours can cause problems for the person, and for other people around them. In the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other countries, personality disorders are classed as a kind of mental disorder and are treated by medical professionals. About ten percent of adults have PDs. They are often caused by child abuse and trauma.

In the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", a book about mental illness written by the American Psychiatric Association, there are ten personality disorders. They are split into three "clusters" or groups.

Cluster A is the odd or eccentric group of personality disorders. They have similarities with schizophrenia. They are:

Cluster B is the dramatic or emotional group of personality disorders. They are:

All Cluster B disorders are comorbid with each other. There are things that are in more than one PD. For example, selfishness and lack of empathy are major parts of ASPD and NPD. Needing to be admired is a major part of HPD and NPD.

Cluster C is the anxious or fearful group of personality disorders. They are:

The World Health Organization has a different way of describing personality disorders. It makes use of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD).

The specific personality disorders are: paranoid, schizoid, dissocial, emotionally unstable (borderline type and impulsive type), histrionic, anankastic, anxious (avoidant) and dependent in the current version. The current version is the ICD-10.


Mood disorder

A mood disorder or affective disorder is a type of mental illness where the main problem is the person's mood. The two main kinds of mood disorder are depressive disorders (like major depressive disorder) and bipolar disorder. Some other mood disorders can be caused by using drugs.

Most people who have mood disorders also have other mental disorders, such as personality disorders and anxiety disorders.

Mood

A mood is an emotional state of mind. They can be positive or negative. People sometimes say they are in a "good mood", if they are happy, or a "bad mood" if they are sad, or angry. Moods can last for several hours or days.

Sometimes, people's moods depend on what kind of personality they have. People who are optimistic are often in a good mood. People who are pessimistic are often in a bad mood. People's moods also change when things happen to them. For example, if something bad happens in a person's life, they may be sad or angry as a result.

When people's moods are disturbed for a long time, they may have a mental illness called a mood disorder, like major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder.

Appetite

codice_1 is wanting to eat food, the feeling of hunger. Humans and animals have appetite to make sure that they eat enough food to survive. A loss of appetite is also called anorexia (this is not the same as the eating disorder anorexia nervosa).

Appetite can change when people are ill, when they have eating disorders and when they are on different types of medications. A big appetite can make somebody eat more than they need to, and they can put on weight, even becoming obese. A small appetite can make someone eat less than they need to, making them lose weight or become malnourished.

Fatigue

Fatigue or tiredness is a physical or mental feeling. It happens when someone is ready to sleep or has done a lot of physical exercise. The person may feel weak, slow or sleepy. They may yawn and may find it difficult to keep the eyes open. Usual fatigue goes away when you rest or sleep.

Fatigue may also be caused by physical or mental illness, jet lag, drug or alcohol use, medications, blood loss, malnutrition, starvation, stress or boredom.

Parliament of Australia

The Parliament of Australia is the federal governing system in Australia. It was formed on May 9, 1901. The parliament is bicameral, which means it has two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate. It was copied mainly from the way the United Kingdom's Parliament was run, the Westminster system, but it also has some ideas from the United States Congress. The laws which control the way the parliament is set up and its powers are part of the Australian Constitution. The Parliament meets in a special building, Parliament House, in Canberra.

The parliament has four main functions:

The Australian Parliament first met in the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne in 1901. It then took over the Victorian Parliament in Melbourne until it moved to Canberra in 1927. A new building for the Parliament was finished in 1988 to celebrate 200 years of European settlement in Australia.

There are 151 members of the House of Representatives, each one elected for a three year term. Each member represents about 150,000 people living in an electorate. The boundaries of each electorate are often changed to keep the number of people in each electorate is the same. The size of each electorate can be very different. The electorate of Durack, in Western Australia, covers an area of 1.3 million square kilometres, while Wentworth in New South Wales is only 26 square kilometres.

The government is formed by the political party (or group of political parties) who have the most members in the House. The House is set out in the British style, even using the green colours of the House of Commons. The Speaker sits at the front; the members of the government sit on the seats to his right, and the opposition sits on the seats to his left. The Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, government ministers, and the shadow ministers, sit at a large table in the centre.

The Senate is the upper house of the Australian Parliament. There are 76 members in the Senate. There are 12 senators for each Australian state, and 2 for each territory. The Senate makes and changes legislation. To become law, legislation must be passed by both houses and then be signed by the Governor-General.

The colours in the Australian Senate are red, as in the British House of Lords. The senators sit in a U shape around a central table. The head of the Senate, known as the President, sits at the head of the table. On their right are the government senators, and on their left the opposition. Senators from minor political parties and Independent senators sit at the bottom of the U shape.



Mathematics Subject Classification

The Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) system is an alphanumeric ordering system for categorizing or arranging mathematical topics, similar to how a library arranges or orders their books on the shelves. The system was invented by the American Mathematical Society based on two major mathematical publishers: Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt MATH. The MSC system is used by many journals of mathematics which ask authors to list the MSC subject codes in their papers when submitted for publication.


American Mathematical Society

The American Mathematical Society (AMS) is an association of professional mathematicians who work together in the interests of mathematical education, research, and scholarships. It does so with publications, conferences, services, and monetary awards and prizes to mathematicians.

Las Meninas

Las Meninas is an oil painting by the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez. The painting hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, the capital of Spain. It was painted in 1656.

The word “Menina” means “lady-in-waiting” or “Maid of Honour”, i.e. a girl who serves in a royal court. There is a lot of detail in the painting, and more has been written about it than about almost any other Western painting because it is quite complicated. For example: people do not always agree about who is looking at whom and why they are standing there.

"Las Meninas" shows a large room in the Madrid palace of King Phillip IV of Spain . Several people are in the painting, and we know who they are. Some are looking at one another and others are looking out from the painting at the viewer (the person who is looking at the painting).

The person who stands in the middle is the Infanta Margarita Teresa of Austria (the princess, daughter of the king and queen). She has two maids of honour, one on each side of her, a chaperone, a bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Velázquez has also painted himself, standing just behind the princess and her companions. He is standing at the artist’s easel. He has stopped painting for a moment and looks straight out at the viewer. At the back of the room is a mirror in which we can see the top halves of the bodies of the king and queen. This means that the king and queen are the viewers who are looking at the painting. The king and queen are probably being painted by Velázquez, but not everybody agrees with this.

Velázquez was very famous in his lifetime. He painted portraits of several royal people at the Spanish court. Philip himself did not like being painted when he was old, but he allowed Velázquez to include him in "Las Meninas". He had given Velázquez a special room where he could paint, and he often sat and watched the painter at work in his studio.

The painting was damaged a bit by a fire in 1734 and some of it was repainted, including the left cheek of the Infanta. In recent years it lost some of its colour, partly due to the pollution caused by so many visitors to the gallery. It was cleaned in 1984. Some people thought it made the picture look different.
The people in "Las Meninas" are in Velázquez's studio in the royal palace. The Infanta Margarita Teresa of Austria (number 1 in the key picture) in the middle of the picture is five years old. She later married the Roman Emperor Leopold. She has two ladies-in-waiting ("meninas"): doña Isabel de Velasco (2), who is about to curtsy to the princess, and doña María Agustina Sarmiento de Sotomayor (3), who kneels in front of Margarita, offering her a drink from a red cup, or "bucaro", that she holds on a golden tray. To the right of the Infanta are two dwarfs: Maribarbola (4) who was German, and Nicolas Pertusato (5) who was Italian. He is trying to wake up a dog by his feet. Behind them stands doña Marcela de Ulloa (6), the princess's chaperone, dressed in mourning and talking to a bodyguard (or "guardadamas") (7). We do not know the name of the bodyguard.

At the back on the right stands Don José Nieto Velázquez (8)—the queen's chamberlain during the 1650s, and the head of the royal tapestry works—who may have been a relative of the artist. Nieto is shown pausing, with his right knee bent and his feet on different steps. We are not sure what he is doing. None of the people in the picture can see him. Only the viewer (the king and queen?) can.

Velázquez himself (9) stands to the left of the scene, looking outward past a large canvas supported by an easel. On his chest is the red cross of the Order of Santiago, which he did not receive until 1659, three years after the painting was completed. He later added the cross to the painting.

The mirror on the back wall reflects the upper bodies and heads of the King Philip IV (10) and his queen, Mariana (11). Most people think that they are being painted by Velázquez, and that their daughter, the Infanta, is watching them.

Bonao

Bonao is a Dominican city and the head municipality of the Monseñor Nouel province, in the center of the country.

"Bonao" is the Taíno name of the region where the old city was founded. The city is in the Bonao Valley, at about 85 km to the northwest of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic.

The municipality had, in , a total population of 76,241: 37,349 men and 38,892 women. The urban population was of the total population.

Christopher Columbus founded in 1494 a small fort in the region known by the Taíno people as Bonao. The fort was built to protect the gold mines around Maimón and other places. But there was not much gold in the region and the fort was soon left without people.

The town was founded again during the early years of the 19th century but at about to the north of the old place, closer to the River Yuna. The new town had the name "Yuna" was soon was changed to the old one: "Bonao". It was also called "El Bonao" (English: "The Bonao") but the article "El" (English: "The") was left out during the first years of the 20th century and it is never used now.

The new small town was made a "Puesto Cantonal" (and old category, like a "Military Post") in 1859 and then a municipality of La Vega province in 1865.

In 1936, its name was changed to "Monseñor Meriño" after the Archbishop Adolfo A. Nouel, past president of the country. In 1960, it got is old name of Bonao.

Bonao is in the Bonao Valley in the centre of the Dominican Republic. It has a total area of . It has five municipal districts (a municipal district is a subdivision of a municipality); these are Arroyo Toro-Masipedro, Jayaco, Juma Bejucal, La Salvia-Los Quemados and Sabana del Puerto.

The altitude of the city of Bonao is above sea level.

The municipality of Bonao has the La Vega province to the north and to the west, the Sánchez Ramírez province to the east, the municipality of Maimón to the southeast, the municipality of Piedra Blanc to the south and the province of San José de Ocoa province to the southwest.

The city is near the River Yuna, one of the most important river of the Hispaniola island; the sources of the river are on the eastern side of the "Cordillera Central" ("Central mountain range"). It flows through the Bonao Valley and then through the Cibao Valley and into the Samaná Bay.

There are other smaller rivers near Bonao, tributaries of the River Yuna.

Bonao has a tropical wet climate (Köppen-Geiger classification: Af) with no dry or cold season as it is constantly moist (rainfalls during the whole year).

The average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is . The month with the most precipitation on average is May with of rainfall, followed by October with .

The driest season is winter. The month with the least rainfall on average is January with an average of followed by February with an average of .

The municipality of Bonao has five municipal districts:

Farming is very important around the city; it is one of main regions of the country where rice is grown.

Mining is also important here; nickel is mined in a mountain close to the city by the Falconbridge, a Canadian company.

Lewis and Clark Expedition

The Lewis and Clark Expedition was an expedition by Meriwether Lewis (1774–1809) and William Clark (1770–1838), two men chosen by United States President Thomas Jefferson to explore the Louisiana Purchase territory, which the country had just bought from France. (This land was made up of much of what is now the Central and Western United States). They left Saint Louis in 1804, leading a group of 33 people. The group reached the Pacific in 1806, viewing much of the West on the way and writing down what they saw. Along the way, the group was joined by a Shoshone Native American woman named Sacagawea, helped guide and translate for them. After their exploration, Lewis became Governor of Louisiana Territory, and Clark became Governor of Missouri Territory. The only person that died on the trip was Sergeant Charles Floyd, Jr. He died on August 20, 1804 from Dysentery. It was a very good expedition for the United States of America.

Baia Mare

Baia Mare is a municipality in the northwestern part of Romania. It is the seat of Maramureş County. 137,921 people were living in Baia Mare as of 2002.

Cyanide Spill of 2000: An hour before midnight on January 30, 2000, a dam holding back water in a settling area for the Baia Mare gold mine burst, spilling its contents into the Somes river, and subsequently into the Tisza river. The spill resulted in the release of at least 100,000 cubic meters of water containing high concentrations of cyanide, as well as heavy metals such as copper, zinc and lead. Cyanide is used to purify gold from rocks, and the water contained concentrations that exceeded the 'heavily polluted' threshold by 40 to 160 times. Zinc concentration was twice the acceptable standard, and lead concentration was 5 to 9 times greater. Rumanian authorities were quickly notified of the spill and immediately raised an alarm that prevented the loss of any human life. However, the spill killed all aquatic plant and animal life for dozens of miles downstream. On February 12, the toxic water flowed into the Danube, which receives water from the Tisza, carrying its impact into Hungary and Serbia, as well. Inhabitants of Belgrade witnessed a Danube with dead fish floating on the surface. Up to 100 people, most of them children, were treated after eating fish contaminated by the heavy chemicals. The Rumanian media entitled this environmental disaster ‘the largest since Chernobyl’.
Baia Mare has the following towns as its 'sister cities':


Umm Kulthum

Umm Kulthum Ibrahim es-Sayyid el-Beltagi , (4 May 1904 – 3 February 1975) was an Egyptian singer, songwriter and actress in the Arab world of the 20th century. She is seen as a national icon of Egypt. She became known as ""The Voice of Egypt"" and ""Egypt's Fourth Pyramid"." Kulthum was given the honorific title ""Kawkab el-charq."" It means 'Planet of the East'. She performed over 320 songs. These include ""al-atlal"." It was ranked one of the top 100 songs of the 20th century. Her funeral was attended by four million people in the streets of Cairo.

Umm Kulthum's exact date of birth is not known. According to birth records of the Province, it is thought to be on 4 May 1904, . She had a sister and a brother. Her sister was named Sayyida. She was ten years older than Umm. Her brother was named Khalid. He was one year older than Umm. Umm Kulthum came from a very humble background. Her mother, Fatma al-maliji, took care of the children and the house. Her father - Al-Shaykh Ibrahim Al-Sayyid Al-Baltaji- was a local Imam in the village of . When she was five years old, her father sent her to a religious school - - to learn to recite the Qur'an. Umm Kalthoum's father Al-Baltaji, used to sing religious songs in weddings and ceremonies - such as the Prophet's birth and the Islamic New Year- in neighboring villages as a way of generating income. Commemorating such events by reciting the Qur'an was part and parcel of the peasant society where Umm Kulthum grew in. To listen to a good Qur'anic chanter was ""one of the few means at the "fallah's" (peasant) disposal which was not censored, punished, taxed or confiscated, unlike everything else he owned"". Al-Baltaji, first discovered Umm Kulthum's voice when she recited the songs he taught to his son Khalid. Afterwards, Umm Kulthum started tagging along her father's trips and became part of the ensemble. In the beginning, and due to the conservative society where they were living, her father dressed her up like a boy while preforming together on stage. However, her father was compelled to accept the idea of his daughter singing in front of an audience because the family needed the money. Umm Kulthum recounted: ""at first, I was like a parrot. What my father sang, I sang"" and shortly after became known as ""the little girl with the powerful voice"". The daughter of the Egyptian village ""bint il-rif"" moved with her family to Cairo in the 1920's in pursuit of a better life. With their move to Cairo, they noticed that religious songs were not cherished as before while nightclubs and cabarets were becoming more and more popular. Umm Kulthum noted: ""when I first came to Cairo, religious songs had declined in popularity. British soldiers crowded the nightclubs that grew up to accommodate them. ... Singers held a low-esteem but the most famous ones had great influence even with members of the Government"".

When Umm Kulthum first moved to Cairo, she continued singing religious songs in concerts and celebrations but did not find much appreciation for this type of music. Afterwards, she started singing poems """ as well as """ and eventually moved to love songs and ""." Egyptian magazine noted this shift in her music; which went from praising the Prophet to praising the lover and attributed it to ""the desire to satisfy the people, to stoop all to all of their passions and whims!"". Umm Kulthum gave a concert on the first Thursday of each month among other celebrations and ceremonies. noticed her popularity rising and first approached with a job offer in 1923 and her initial recordings were written by Ahmad Sabri al-Najridi. Her records sold everywhere and with her recordings the company made large profits. In fact, many of the people who bought her recordings were her past rural audience whom she grew popular among, but also Egyptians of all walks of life waited in line to buy her recordings. Nevertheless, what facilitated her debut as a professional singer was the mentoring she received on the hands of the poet Ahmad Rami. Slowly but steadily, she became acquainted with Egypt's elites and politicians and became an esteemed guest at their residences and this increased her success, power and position in the Egyptian society. It is said that the year 1926 was the turning point which transformed Umm Kulthum from a famous singer to an illuminous star in Egypt. This pivotal moment was aided by her decision to employ a professional orchestra rather than her relative instrument players.. Her success drew more and more critics and enemies but this only heightened her popularity. The 1940's were deemed the ""golden age"" of Umm Kulthum due to having reached the height of her vocal powers and becoming a mature singer. Moreover, Umm Kulthum started experimenting with new ""qasa'id"" and populist songs. Her Thursday concerts were not only anticipated in Egypt but all throughout the Arab world, listeners would tune in on the radio and enjoy a night of enchantment ""tarab"".

Umm Kulthum is seen as a national icon of Egypt and defined the Arabic music all over North Africa and the Middle East in the 20th century. She became known as "“The Voice of Egypt”", "“Star of the East”" and "“Egypt’s Fourth Pyramid”". Her music spans a time period of around fifty years (1924-1973), whereby mass cultural and political shifts were experienced in North Africa and the Middle East. Not alone did Umm Kulthum's music attribute to the cultural heritage of the region, her music also evolved with the changing political dynamics in Egypt. Umm Kulthum herself was thereby active in challenging the position of women in music and in the country and contributed to the forming of a national identity of the Egyptians after post-colonial rule.
Umm Kulthum challenged the position of women within Egyptian society by starting her professional singing in a time period when women performing was a taboo. During her whole career, she undermined traditional gender norms by making her own business deals and often singing to an audience mostly filled by men. Besides that, she also fulfilled the role of presidency within the Musicians Union for seven years, despite being opposed by many because of her gender. Umm Kulthum also resisted to give up her singing career for a family life and she had two unconventional marriages. Her first marriage ended within days, while her second marriage – at the age of 50 – was with a younger man with children from an ex-wife.

Umm Kulthum’s music often covered topics regarding longing, love, loss and romance. However, her songs also appointed controversial topics. With her music, she pushed for gender boundaries and dictated women’s desires, sexuality and political thought. 

Umm Kulthum contributed to the shaping of a pan-Arabic identity in anti-colonial movements within North Africa and the Middle East. She became a symbol of nationalism in Egypt as a supporter of the Nasserist Revolution. The line of Umm Kulthum’s love song "“al-Atlal”": "“Give me my freedom, release my hands”" became a famous slogan against colonial rule and Israeli occupation. 

Her support for Gamal Abdel Nasser was a mutually beneficial relationship. Nasser nationalised radio, music and all forms of public media and he was aware of the unifying power of Umm Kulthum's music in creating the vision of Pan-Arabism. He granted her an entire radio station and Umm Kulthum had the honor of performing before and after his public speeches.

Umm Kulthum died on 3 February 1975, at the age of 76. She experienced several health problems during most of her lifetime, for which her problems with her eyes forced her to wear sunglasses. Later, this became her signature mark as an artist. Her death led to an outburst of hysterical grief and millions of people lined the streets of Cairo for her funeral. 

Decades after her death, Umm Kulthum remained one of the best-selling singers of the Arab world. The Kawkab al-Sharq Museum in Cairo was established by the Egyptian government in 2001 to honor and celebrate her life and accomplishments.

At the Winter in Tantora festival in Al-‘Ula in January 2019, Umm Kulthum appeared as a hologram during a live concert.

Moon landing conspiracy theories

The moon landing conspiracy theories (also known as moon landing hoax or Apollo hoax) are beliefs that men did not land on the Moon in 1969–1972 during the Apollo program and that NASA faked the information. Some conspiracy theorists believe the Skylab space station is also a hoax.

This belief is considered by the scientific community and historians to be irrational. But on the internet, the debate can occur since it is easy for anyone to publish their ideas. There are subcultures within the USA and cultures around the world that believe that the Moon landings were faked. This view is claimed to have been taught in Cuban schools and wherever else Cuban teachers are sent (Nicaragua, Angola). It is also shared by the Taliban and by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON).

On 12 April 1961, the USSR sent the first man into space in Vostok 1, Yuri Gagarin. Six weeks later, US President John Kennedy promised a manned Moon landing by 1969 to win the battle of systems and impress the world with technical superiority:

Moon conspiracy theorists say that NASA had too many technical problems to meet the eight year deadline for going to the moon. But the USA could not afford to appear lose the race to the moon to the Soviet Union, and so the moon landings were faked. In 2004, President George Bush gave not eight but sixteen years for a manned return to the Moon, even though the technologies for it should have already been developed forty years earlier. In 2010, President Barack Obama canceled this plan, which seemed to the moon conspiracy theorists to be an admission that the USA still does not have the technology to go to the moon.

Doubts about the authenticity of the Apollo Moon landings appeared first in December 1968 when Apollo 8 was launched. The almost perfectly executed odyssey of Apollo 11 amazed many around the world, and some people doubted it was real.

The first book on the subject ("Did man land on the Moon?") was issued in Texas by the mathematician James J. Cranny in 1970.

NASA commented on some of the conspiracy theories in June 1977. But in August 1997, their Director of Media Services (1998–2000) Brian Welch (1958–2000) said in an interview with Sky TV News:

When Fox TV aired Bruce Nash's film "Conspiracy theory: Did we land on the Moon?" in 2001, NASA released hoax theory rebuttal materials on their web and FTP sites. They also wrote suggestions for science teachers on how to refute the hoax claims using the Lunar Sample Disk Kits.

In 2002, NASA hired James Edward Oberg, to write a book intended to challenge those who claim the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax. Oberg was a former rocket scientist, MSNBC News space consultant and analyst and journalist, and, it was later discovered, a moon landing conspiracy theorist. But NASA soon cancelled the project, declining to give the reasons for this. NASA spokesman Bob Jacobs said criticism that NASA was displaying poor judgement and a lack of confidence in commissioning the book caused the agency to abort it. For example, then NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe said:

In 2006, some of the recordings of the Apollo era were declared missing. The question of what happened to the recordings was seen by conspiracy theorists as confirmation of their beliefs, and in 2009, NASA revealed that the tapes were erased.

The arguments about the moon conspiracy theories are detailed and complex. Some of the major points and counterpoints are listed below.

Moon conspiracy theorists think that NASA faked the Apollo mission with a secret program. According to James Longuski, the complexity of the conspiracy theory scenarios make them impossible. More than 400,000 people worked on the Apollo project for almost ten years, and 12 men who walked on the Moon returned to Earth to talk about their experiences. Hundreds of thousands of people would have had to keep the secret. Longuski says that it would have been a lot easier to actually land on the Moon than to create such a large conspiracy to fake it.
1. In some photos, the are seemed to be partially covered by objects. Some conspiracy theorists suggest that the NASA composed the photographs by "cutting and pasting" objects over the background images.

2. In some photos, the crosshairs are rotated.

3. The letter "C" appears on some rocks. This is maybe a designation by the studio props.

4. The book "Moon Shot" contains a fake photo of Alan Shepard hitting a golf ball on the Moon with another astronaut.

1. The Apollo 16 crew could not have survived solar flares when they were on their way to the Moon.

2. During the Apollo 15 mission, David Scott did an experiment by dropping a hammer and a falcon feather at the same time. Both hit the ground at the same time.

Blueprints and drawings of the machines used in the Apollo project are missing. Some Apollo 11 tapes containing telemetry and high quality video of the first moonwalk are also missing. Moon landing conspiracy theorists believe that this is because they never existed, since the mission was faked.

Dr. David Williams (NASA archivist at Goddard Space Flight Center) and Apollo 11 flight director Eugene F. Kranz acknowledged that some of the Apollo 11 tapes are missing. When the recordings were sent back to Earth to be shown on TV, they were converted to a different format which was lower quality. Now the lower quality tapes are available, but the original high quality videos received in Australia are missing. Some pictures of the original high quality image are still available, and videos have been released from other missions too, like the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package.

Some people at NASA are looking for the tapes to help them plan for future missions. They believe the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984 all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center. The tapes may have been stored rather than re-used, and efforts to determine where they were stored are ongoing. Goddard was storing 35,000 new tapes per year in 1967, even before the lunar landings.

On November 1, 2006 Cosmos Magazine reported that 100 data tapes recorded in Australia during the Apollo 11 mission had been found in the basement of the Curtin University of Technology in Perth, Australia. One of the old tapes was sent to NASA for analysis.

On July 16, 2009, NASA said that it must have erased the original Apollo 11 Moon footage years ago so that it could reuse the tape. On December 22, 2009 NASA issued a final report on the tapes. Senior engineer Dick Nafzger concluded that approximately 45 tapes of Apollo 11 video were erased and reused. For the 40th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing, Lowry Digital of Burbank, California restored the low quality videos. Some pieces of the restored footage are available on the NASA website.

Some conspiracy theorists say that some astronauts were killed as part of a cover up. In a television program about the conspiracy theory, Fox Entertainment Group listed 10 astronauts and 2 others who conspiracy theorists said were killed.

All the deaths except for Irwin's were related to their job with NASA or the Air Force. Mike Adams and Robert Lawrence were not involved with the civilian space program. James Irwin already had several heart attacks before his death. All except two of the deaths happened at least one or two years "before" Apollo 11. Also, Brian Welch was speaking out "against" the moon hoax, so he would not have been a good target to be killed.

As of November 2018, four of the twelve Apollo astronauts who landed on the Moon between 1969 and 1972 were still alive, including Buzz Aldrin. Also, nine of the twelve Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing between 1968 and 1972 are still alive, for example Michael Collins.

During 1961 to 1972, at least eight Russian cosmonauts died:

Additionally, the chief of their spaceflight program, Sergei Korolev, died in January 1966.

Conspiracy theorists say that telescopes, for example the Hubble, should be able to take pictures of the moon where Apollo landed, and if people really did land on the moon, then the pictures should show the scars on the moon's surface and equipment it left behind. They believe that our major observatories will not take pictures of the landing sites because it would expose the cover-up.

NASA has said that images have been taken of these landing sites, but the pictures taken by Hubble are too low quality to see very much detail. In 2009 NASA released pictures from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter showing the Apollo landing sites in more detail. These photographs have not convinced the conspiracy theorists because the pictures were taken by NASA, and they think NASA is behind the cover-up.

Bart Sibrel (a conspiracy theorist) says that the Soviet Union had much more time in space than the United States before the Apollo Program. The Soviet Union put the first satellite in orbit in October 1957 named Sputnik 1. They also put the first animal in space in Sputnik 2, and were the first country to safely bring back an animal from space in Sputnik 5. Yuri Gagrin was the first man to orbit the Earth in Vostok 1, who was also from the Soviet Union. Sibrel believes that since the Soviet Union was so far ahead of the United States in the Moon race, the United States had to fake the landings to win.

On January 27, 1967, Apollo 1 caught fire and killed 3 astronauts. Two years later, NASA said that the problems which caused the fire were fixed. Bart Sibrel believes that the problems could not be fixed, so NASA decided to fake the landings to win the Moon race.

NASA says that the Soviet Union's achievements were not as impressive as the United States. According to the "Encyclopaedia Astronautica", the US spent 1,864 hours in space, while the Soviets spent 697 hours at the completion of Soyuz 5. Apollo 7 launched in October 1968, 21 months after the Apollo 1 fire, with an astronaut on board. By Apollo 11, the United States' lead was even bigger.

Both the United States and the Soviet Union had many problems during the Moon race. The Soviet Union had the first in-flight death in 1967, only 3 months after the Apollo 1 fire. According to NASA, most of the accomplishments first made by the Soviets were also made by the US within a year. By 1965, the US started to beat the Soviets to a few important steps. The Soviets had never developed a rocket which could land on the Moon, and they never tested landing on the Moon with an astronaut on board. "

Some conspiracy theorists say that the Moon rocks collected by the Apollo Program are actually meteorites from Antarctica. Wernher von Braun, the Marshall Space Flight Center Director, and three others traveled to Antarctica in 1967 (three years before the Apollo launch) to explore for future space missions. Some conspiracy theorists believe that Braun collected meteorites during this trip to use as fake moon rocks.

The Apollo Program collected of moon rocks during the Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 missions. According to scientists around the world, these rocks are very different from meteorites and other rocks found on Earth. The rocks are also 200,000,000 (200 million) years older than any rock found on Earth, and are similar to moon rocks later brought back by the USSR.

Some moon rocks could have been collected without landing on the moon, but the first moon rock was found on Earth in 1979, and it was only discovered in 1982 that it came from the moon. Also, moon rocks are very rare on Earth, and only have ever been discovered, while the Apollo missions brought back 380 kilograms.

In 2004, Martin Hendry and Ken Skeldon from the University of Glasgow investigated the 'Moon Hoax'. In November 2004, they spoke at the Glasgow Science Centre and examined the top ten lines of evidence that a hoax had taken place. 



Illinois General Assembly

The Illinois General Assembly is the state legislature of the state of Illinois. It comprises the Illinois House of Representatives and the Illinois Senate. The General Assembly was created by the first state constitution which was adopted in 1818. Illinois has 59 legislative districts. It had two representatives and one senator from each district.

Whig Party (United States)

The Whig Party was a conservative political party of the United States. It was famous during the years of Jacksonian democracy. It is thought to be important to the Second Party System. Operating from 1833 to 1856, party was formed opposing the policies of President Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party. The Whigs supported the importance of Congress over the importance of the executive branch. They favored a program of modernization. Their name was chosen to tell people about the American Whigs of 1776, who fought for independence. "Whig" was then a widely recognized label of choice for people who saw themselves as opposing autocratic rule. The Whig Party had national leaders as Daniel Webster, William Henry Harrison, Henry Clay of Kentucky. The Whig Party also had four war heroes among them, such as Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott. Abraham Lincoln was a Whig leader in frontier Illinois.

In its over two decades of existence, the Whig Party saw two of its candidates, Harrison and Taylor, elected president. Both died in office. John Tyler became president after Harrison's death, but was thrown out from the party. Millard Fillmore, who became president after Taylor's death, was the last Whig to hold the nation's highest office.

The party was ultimately destroyed by the question of whether to allow the expansion of slavery to the territories. The anti-slavery faction successfully prevented the nomination of its own incumbent President Fillmore in the 1852 presidential election. Instead, the party nominated General Winfield Scott, who was defeated. Its leaders quit politics (as Lincoln did temporarily) or changed parties. The voter base defected to the Republican Party, various coalition parties in some states, and to the Democratic Party. By the 1856 presidential election, the party had lost its ability to maintain a national coalition of effective state parties and endorsed Millard Fillmore, now of the American Party, at its last national convention.

Metronet

Metronet Rail was the brand of a partnership within the London Underground group. The group was responsible for the maintenance and upgrade of the infrastructure on nine London Underground lines. They would do the maintenance of tracks, trains, signals, civil work and stations. From 18 July 2007 to 26 May 2008, the company was in administration and had to be bailed out by the government. On 27 May 2008, the company was transferred back into public ownership under the authority of Transport for London.

Leishmania is a protist
organism which causes Leishmaniasis. It is a Trypanosomatid parasite in the Euglenozoa phylum.

It is spread by sandflies of the genus "Phlebotomus" in the Old World, and of the genus "Lutzomyia" in the New World. 

Their primary hosts are vertebrates; Leishmania commonly infects hyraxes, canids, rodents, and humans. Leishmania currently affects 12 million people in 98 countries.
The parasite was named in 1903 after the Scottish pathologist William Boog Leishman.

The parasite causes three kinds of disease. Each type of disease is caused by different species of the parasite.


"Leishmania" have a lipophosphoglycan coat on the outside of the cell. This is a trigger for toll-like receptor 2, a signalling receptor which triggers an innate immune response in mammals. The parasite can withstand the counter-attack by the immune system. There are treatments, which consist in helping the immune system to respond.

50000 Quaoar

50000 Quaoar (symbol: ) is a Trans-Neptunian object and is also a dwarf planet. It was discovered on June 4, 2002 by Chad Trujillo and Michael Brown at the California Institute of Technology.

Quaoar has one known moon, named Weywot. It also has a ring. Unexpectedly, the ring is at twice the distance of the Roche limit, which was thought to be the maximum distance of a ring: beyond the Roche limit, the particles in a ring should clump together and form a moon; yet this has not happened to Quaoar's ring. It is thought that the particles do not clump together because of tides created by Weywot. There may also be small shepherd moons on either side of the ring, as there are at Saturn's F Ring.

Samlesbury witches

The Samlesbury witches were three women who were said to be witches, murderers and cannibals. The three women, Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley, were accused of practising witchcraft by a 14-year-old girl, Grace Sowerbutts. They were tried in the village of Samlesbury in Lancashire. Their trial on 19 August 1612 was one of a series of witch trials held over two days. It is among the most famous in English history. The trials were unusual for England at that time for two reasons. First, Thomas Potts, the clerk to the court, wrote about it in his "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster". Secondly, the number of people found guilty and hanged were high: ten at Lancaster and another at York. Some of those accused were burnt alive and hung. 

However, the three Samlesbury women were found not guilty of witchcraft. 

The women were accused of murdering children, and of cannibalism, amongst other things. In contrast, other people tried at the same time were accused of "maleficium", that is causing harm by witchcraft. This included the Pendle witches. The case against the three women collapsed "spectacularly" when the main witness, Grace Sowerbutts, was shown by the trial judge to be "the perjuring tool of a Catholic priest".

Many historians, most notably Hugh Trevor-Roper, have said that the witch trials of the 16th and 17th century were a result of the religious struggles of the period. During this time, both the Catholic and Protestant Churches wanted to stamp out what they saw as heresy. The trial of the Samlesbury witches is perhaps one clear example of that trend; it has been described as "largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda". A trial would show that Lancashire, a wild and lawless area, was being cleared not only of witches but also of "popish plotters", that is, Catholics.

King James I, came to the English throne in 1603. He was influenced by the strict Scottish Reformation very much. He was very interested in witchcraft. By the early 1590s, he was convinced that Scottish witches plotted against him. His 1597 book, "Daemonologie", told his followers that they must report and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft. In 1604 a new witchcraft law was made, called "An Act against Conjuration, Witchcraft and dealing with evil and wicked spirits". Anyone who caused harm by the use of magic or the exhumation of corpses for magical purposes would be given the death penalty. James did not believe some of the evidence presented in witch trials. He even personally showed discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches.

The accused witches lived in Lancashire. At the end of the 16th century, the government thought this county was a wild and lawless area, "fabled for its theft, violence and sexual laxity, where the church was honoured without much understanding of its doctrines by the common people". Since the death of Queen Mary and the coming to the throne of her half-sister Elizabeth in 1558, Catholic priests had been forced to hide, but in Lancashire they were still able to celebrate mass in secret. In early 1612, the year of the trials, each justice of the peace in Lancashire was ordered to make a list of the recusants in their area—those who refused to attend the services of the Church of England, which was a criminal offence at that time.

During the 16th century English Reformation, the Church of England broke away from the rule of the pope and the Catholic Church. This event split up the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall. Sir John Southworth, head of the family until his death in 1595, was a leading recusant. He was arrested many times for not giving up his Catholic faith. His eldest son, also called John, did join the Church of England, for which his father disinherited him. The rest of the family stayed strictly Catholic.

One of the accused witches, Jane Southworth, was the widow of the disinherited son, John. Relations father and son were not polite; John Singleton, said that the father would not even go past his son's house if he could keep clear of it, and believed that Jane would probably kill her husband. Jane Southworth (born Jane Sherburne) and John were married in about 1598, and the couple lived in Samlesbury Lower Hall. John had died only a few months before her trial for witchcraft in 1612, and she had seven children.

On 21 March 1612, Alizon Device, who lived just outside the Lancashire village of Fence, near Pendle Hill, met John Law, a pedlar from Halifax. She asked him for some pins, which he refused to give to her, and a few minutes later Law suffered a stroke, for which he blamed Alizon. Along with her mother Elizabeth and her brother James, Alizon had to appear before local magistrate Roger Nowell on 30 March 1612. Based on the evidence and confessions he obtained, Nowell sent Alizon and ten others to Lancaster Gaol, to be tried for "maleficium"—causing harm by witchcraft.

Other Lancashire magistrates learned of Nowell's discovery of witchcraft in the county. On 15 April 1612 JP Robert Holden began investigations in his own area of Samlesbury. As a result, eight people were sent to trial, including Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley. They were said to have used witchcraft on Grace Sowerbutts, Jennet's granddaughter and Ellen's niece.

The trial was held on 19 August 1612 before Sir Edward Bromley, a judge seeking promotion to a circuit nearer London. He may have wanted to impress King James, the head of the judiciary. Before the trial, Bromley ordered the release of five of the eight defendants from Samlesbury, with a warning about their future conduct. Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley were said to have used "diverse devilish and wicked Arts, called Witchcrafts, Inchauntments, Charmes, and Sorceries, in and upon one Grace Sowerbutts", to which they pleaded not guilty. Fourteen-year-old Grace was the chief prosecution witness.

Grace was the first to give evidence. She said that both her grandmother and aunt, Jennet and Ellen Bierley, were able to change themselves into dogs and that they had "haunted and vexed her" for years. She also said that they had transported her to the top of a hayrick by her hair. They had also tried to make her drown herself. Grace said the women had taken her to the house of Thomas Walshman and his wife, from whom they had stolen a baby to suck its blood. Grace said the child died the next night and after its burial at Samlesbury Church, Ellen and Jennet dug up the body and took it home. The women then cooked and ate some of it and used the rest to make an ointment that let them change themselves into other shapes.

Grace also said that her grandmother and aunt, with Jane Southworth, went to sabbats held every Thursday and Sunday night at Red Bank, on the north shore of the River Ribble. At those secret meetings they met with "foure black things, going upright, and yet not like men in the face", with whom they ate, danced, and had sex.

Thomas Walshman, the father of the baby allegedly killed and eaten by the accused, was the next to give evidence. He confirmed that his child had died of unknown causes at about one-year-old. He added that Grace Sowerbutts was discovered lying as if dead in his father's barn on about 15 April, and did not recover until the following day. Two other witnesses, John Singleton and William Alker, confirmed that Sir John Southworth, Jane Southworth's father-in-law, had been reluctant to pass the house where his son lived, as he believed Jane to be an "evil woman, and a Witch".

Thomas Potts, the clerk, wrote that after hearing the evidence many of those in court were persuaded of the accused's guilt. On being asked by the judge what answer they could make to the charges laid against them, Potts reports that they "humbly fell upon their knees with weeping tears", and "desired him [Bromley] for Gods cause to examine Grace Sowerbutts". Immediately "the countenance of this Grace Sowerbutts changed"; the witnesses "began to quarrel and accuse one another", and eventually admitted that Grace had been coached in her story by a Catholic priest they called Thompson. Bromley then committed the girl to be examined by two JPs, William Leigh and Edward Chisnal. Under questioning Grace readily admitted that her story was untrue, and said she had been told what to say by Jane Southworth's uncle, Christopher Southworth aka Thompson, a Jesuit priest who was in hiding in the Samlesbury area; Southworth was the chaplain at Samlesbury Hall, and Jane Southworth's uncle by marriage. Leigh and Chisnal questioned the three accused women in an attempt to discover why Southworth might have fabricated evidence against them, but none could offer any reason other than that each of them "goeth to the [Anglican] Church".

After the statements had been read out in court Bromley ordered the jury to find the defendants not guilty, stating that:

Potts finished his book with the words: "Thus were these poore Innocent creatures, by the great care and paines of this honourable Judge, delivered from the danger of this Conspiracie; this bloudie practise of the Priest laid open".

Almost everything that is known about the trials comes from a report of the proceedings written by Thomas Potts, the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes. Potts was told to write his account by the trial judges, and had completed the work by 16 November 1612. Bromley revised and corrected the manuscript before its publication in 1613, and said it was "truly reported" and "fit and worthy to be published". Although written as an apparently verbatim account, the book is not a report of what was actually said at the trial, but instead a reflection on what happened. Nevertheless, Potts "seems to give a generally trustworthy, although not comprehensive, account of an Assize witchcraft trial, provided that the reader is constantly aware of his use of written material instead of verbatim reports".

In his introduction to the trial, Potts writes; "Thus have we for a time left the Graund Witches of the Forest of Pendle, to the good consideration of a very sufficient jury." Bromley had by then heard the cases against the three Pendle witches who had confessed to their guilt, but he had yet to deal with the others, who maintained their innocence. He knew that the only testimony against them would come from a nine-year-old girl, and that King James had cautioned judges to examine carefully the evidence presented against accused witches, warning against credulity. In his conclusion to the account of the trial, Potts says that it was interposed in the expected sequence "by special order and commandment", presumably of the trial judges. After having convicted and sentenced to death three witches, Bromley may have been keen to avoid any suspicion of credulity by presenting his "masterful exposure" of the evidence presented by Grace Sowerbutts, before turning his attention back to the remainder of the Pendle witches.

Potts declares that "this Countie of Lancashire ... now may lawfully bee said to abound as much in Witches of divers kinds as Seminaries, Jesuites, and Papists", and describes the three accused women as having once been "obstinate Papists, and now came to Church". The judges would certainly have been keen to be regarded by King James, the head of the judiciary, as having dealt resolutely with Catholic recusants as well as with witchcraft, the "two big threats to Jacobean order in Lancashire". Samlesbury Hall, the family home of the Southworths, was suspected by the authorities of being a refuge for Catholic priests, and it was under secret government surveillance for some considerable time before the trial of 1612. It may be that JP Robert Holden was at least partially motivated in his investigations by a desire to "smoke out its Jesuit chaplain", Christopher Southworth.

The English experience of witchcraft was somewhat different from the European one, with only one really mass witch hunt, that of Matthew Hopkins in East Anglia during 1645. That one incident accounted for more than 20% of the number of witches it is estimated were executed in England between the early 15th and mid-18th century, fewer than 500. The English legal system also differed significantly from the inquisitorial model used in Europe, requiring members of the public to accuse their neighbours of some crime, and for the case to be decided by a jury of their peers. English witch trials of the period "revolved around popular beliefs, according to which the crime of witchcraft was one of ... evil-doing", for which evidence had to be provided.
Potts devotes several pages to a fairly detailed criticism of the evidence presented in Grace Sowerbutts' statement, giving an insight into the discrepancies which existed during the early 17th century between the Protestant establishment's view of witchcraft and the beliefs of the common people, who may have been influenced by the more continental views of Catholic priests such as Christopher Southworth. Unlike their European counterparts, the English Protestant elite believed that witches kept familiars, or companion animals, and so it was not considered credible that the Samlesbury witches had none. Grace's story of the sabbat, too, was unfamiliar to the English at that time, although belief in such secret gatherings of witches was widespread in Europe. Most demonologists of the period, including King James, held that only God could perform miracles, and that he had not given the power to go against the laws of nature to those in league with the Devil. Hence Potts dismisses Sowerbutts' claim that Jennet Bierley transformed herself into a black dog with the comment "I would know by what means any Priest can maintain this point of Evidence". He equally lightly dismisses Grace's account of the sabbat she claimed to have attended, where she met with "foure black things ... not like men in the face", with the comment that "The Seminarie [priest] mistakes the face for the feete: For Chattox [one of the Pendle witches] and all her fellow witches agree, the Devill is cloven-footed: but Fancie [Chattox's familiar] had a very good face, and was a proper man."

It is perhaps unlikely that the accused women would have failed to draw the examining magistrate's attention to their suspicions concerning Grace Sowerbutts' motivations when first examined, only to do so at the very end of their trial when asked by the judge if they had anything to say in their defence. The trial of the Samlesbury witches in 1612 may have been "largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda", or even a "show-trial", the purpose of which was to demonstrate that Lancashire was being purged not only of witches, but also of "popish plotters".

Bromley achieved his desired promotion to the Midlands Circuit in 1616. Potts was given the keepership of Skalme Park by King James in 1615, to breed and train the king's hounds. In 1618, he was given responsibility for "collecting the forfeitures on the laws concerning sewers, for twenty-one years". Jane Southworth's eldest son, Thomas, eventually inherited his grandfather's estate of Samlesbury Hall.



Guernica (Picasso)

Guernica is a world-famous painting by Pablo Picasso. It is one of the world's greatest anti-war paintings. It is a very large painting (a mural) which shows the bombing of the Spanish town of Guernica in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War.

The Spanish Republican government asked Pablo Picasso to paint a large mural for an art exhibition in Paris. It shows how people, as well as animals, all suffer because of the tragedies of war. The painting soon became so famous that it was seen as a world symbol for peace. The fame of the painting helped to bring the Spanish Civil War to an end.

"Guernica" is navy blue, black and white, 3.5 metre (11 ft) tall and 7.8 metre (25.6 ft) wide, a mural-size canvas painted in oil. It hangs in the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid. 

"Guernica" shows a large, open room with people and animals who are suffering. A bull stands over a woman crying over a dead child in her arms. A horse falls in terrible pain as it dies after being run through with a spear. A dead soldier lies under the horse, his arm has been chopped off, but the hand grasps a shattered sword from which a flower grows. A light bulb shines strongly like an evil eye (the Spanish word for "light bulb" is "bombilla" which sounds like "bomb"). A female figure floats in, holding a lamp which is a symbol of hope. There are many other smaller details in the painting.

The painting soon travelled to many countries. It was seen in several towns in the United States during the 1940s and early 1950s. The Spanish dictator Francisco Franco wanted it to come to Spain, but Picasso said that he would not allow it to go to Spain until Spain became a democratic country. Picasso died in 1973. Franco died in 1975 and Spain became a democratic country. The painting went to Spain in 1981 and it now hangs in an art gallery, the Museo Reina Sofía, in Madrid.

Flat Earth Society

The Flat Earth Society (or the International Flat Earth Research Society) is an organization claiming that the Earth is flat (most of us think it is round; a sphere). It was started by Samuel Shenton in 1956. Charles K. Johnson was the leader and made his home the organization's base. The Flat Earth Society is thought to have "disbanded" (stopped existing) after Johnson's death in 2001, but some websites still use the organization's name.

Some people say NASA proved that the Earth is not flat by taking pictures of the planet from space. Others say the round Earth was proven long before NASA existed. The Society says the pictures are fake, and that NASA is a part of a conspiracy.

Balibo (movie)

Balibo is an Australian movie directed by Robert Connolly and released in 2009. It starred Australian actor Anthony LaPaglia who also was the film's producer. It based on the true story of 5 Australian news reporters working for Australian TV during the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975. They were murdered by the Indonesian army in the small village of Balibo.

The Indonesian National Armed Forces did not want the movie shown in Indonesia, with a spokesman saying the movie could harm Indonesia's relations with East Timor and Australia.

The movie was finally forbidden in Indonesia by the Film Censorship Agency. Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said the ban was to avoid a negative image of Indonesia. The Indonesian National Armed Forces supports the ban, with a spokesman saying the official version of the event is that the journalists were killed in a crossfire, and not murdered by Indonesian troops. However, this did not stop people from seeing the movie, as there were some secret cinemas set up to show it.

Pitcher plant

A pitcher plant is a carnivorous plant (also called as Insectivorous plant). Carnivorous plants are plants that eat insects and other small animals. Carnivorous plants grow in soil that has little nitrogen. All living things must have nitrogen. Carnivorous plants get nitrogen from the insects they eat.

The pitcher of the pitcher plant is actually a modified leaf. The apex of the leaf is always the lid. Pitcher plants catch (get) insects in a cup of liquid. The walls of the cup make nectar (sweet liquid). The nectar attracts insects. When an insect lands on the wall, it falls down into the liquid. The insect cannot get out of the cup because the walls are smooth and slippery and the walls have hairs pointing down. 

After the insect is dead, its body rots. Rotting releases (lets loose) the nitrogen from the insect's body. The nitrogen then goes into the liquid and the plant takes in the nitrogen from the liquid.

In Ninny's stories, Idgie and Ruth are friends who run a café together and raise Ruth's son Buddy. Ruth has separated from her husband Frank because he used to hit her. One day, Frank goes missing and the police begin to think that Idgie has killed him.

Ninny tells Evelyn her stories over several visits. During that time, Evelyn, who was depressed, is inspired by Ruth and Idgie to have more power in her life. In the end, Ninny goes to live with Evelyn and her husband. There is a hint that Ninny and Idgie might be the same person.


There are some differences between the movie and the novel it was made from. In the novel, Idgie and Ruth are a lesbian couple. In the movie they may be just friends. The director, John Avnet said that he wanted viewers to make up their own minds. In one part of the movie, Idgie and Ruth have a food fight. Avnet said that the food fight is symbolic of love-making. When it was released, some critics and LGBT activists were angry that the lesbian part of the story had been "glossed over". Even though the lesbian content had been hidden, the movie won an award from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) for best feature movie with lesbian content.

Another difference is that at the end of the movie, it seems possible that Ninny is really Idgie. In the novel, they are completely separate characters and are sisters-in-law.

The movie was nominated for two Academy Awards and two BAFTA awards.

Ischemic colitis

Ischemic colitis (also called Colonic ischemia) is a medical condition in which inflammation and injury cause an inadequite blood supply to the large instestine. It occurs more often in older people. In fact, more than 90% of cases occur in people over the age of 60. Ischemic colitis is the most common form of bowel ischemia.


Most cases of ischemic colitis are mild and will get better on their own. IV fluids are givin to patients to treat dehydration. Patients are also told not to eat or drink anything until the symptoms get better. Severe ischemic colitis that leads to gangrene can be treated with antibiotics and surgery. 


Hypotension

Hypotension is low blood pressure. A person with low blood pressure is called hypotensive.

Everybody's blood pressure is different. Some people have naturally low blood pressure. However, for most adults, a systolic blood pressure of under 90, or a diastolic blood pressure of under 60, is low blood pressure. (Systolic is the top number in a blood pressure reading; diastolic is the bottom number.)

Low blood pressure is not always dangerous. However, low blood pressure is dangerous if it causes any of these symptoms:
If low blood pressure makes a person faint, the person could hurt themselves while falling.

If a person's blood pressure is very low, the heart will be unable to pump blood and oxygen to important parts of the body. Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to live. Without blood and oxygen, important parts of the body, like the heart and brain, can be damaged.

If a person's blood pressure is low enough that they are feeling dizzy, they should lay down on the ground. Putting their feet up, or bending their knees, is also helpful. This makes it easier for blood and oxygen to get to the brain (because the blood does not have to work against gravity to get up to the brain, like it would if the person were standing). Lying down will also make sure that the person does not hurt themselves by falling if they faint.

Doctors can treat hypotension by treating whatever is causing the low blood pressure. Sometimes, low blood pressure is caused by dehydration. This can be treated by having the patient eat more salt, drink more fluids, or (in serious cases) get fluids through a needle placed into a vein.

If low blood pressure is caused by medicines, doctors can change those medications to others that do not lower blood pressure as much.

There are also medications that increase blood pressure. They work by making it harder for blood vessels to relax. (When blood vessels relax, blood pressure goes down. If the blood vessels cannot relax as easily, blood pressure goes up.)


Race condition

A Race condition (also called race hazard) is a problem with the design of a system. With a race condition, the result of a calculation or the behaviour of the system as a whole is dependent on how long a certain calculation takes, or when it is started. Race conditions occur in logic circuits and computer software, especially with multi-threaded or distributed systems.

It is often difficult to explain what a race condition is, but the metaphor of a horse race can be used as an explanation.

A computer program is like a horse race. The computer program does several things at the same time, similarly to how several horses run at the same time in a horse race. Each horse represents what is usually called a "thread of execution". That way, one such thread may handle network communication, another one may be responsible for redrawing the user interface. In the case of a race condition, the application works properly if a given horse "wins the race". For example, the application may work if horse number five wins, but it will crash if any other horse wins the race. One solution to the problem is to use synchronization. This is like several jockeys teaming up, to make sure horse number five is ahead. 

On different computers, or in different situations, computers programs can run at different speeds. Sometimes, they will be faster, other times slower. This may mean that on some systems, the race condition will never show up, even though it may be easy to show it on others. Race conditions can be difficult to find. Bugs caused by race conditions are a frequent source of frustration within the profession of software development.

Mary-Louise Parker

Mary-Louise Parker (born August 2, 1964) is an American television and movie actress.
Parker was born in 1964 in Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Her mother was Swedish and her father was a judge and served in the United States Army. They lived in Thailand where she attended the International School Bangkok. Parker studied drama at the North Carolina School of the Arts. Her first job in television was a small part on the soap opera "Ryan's Hope" in 1975. In the late 1980s, she moved to New York, where she got a job measuring feet at ECCO (a shoe shop). After a few small roles, she had her first part in a Broadway play in 1990. The play was called "Prelude to a Kiss" and she played the main character called Rita. She won the Clarence Derwent Award for this play and was nominated for a Tony Award. Parker dated her co-star Timothy Hutton for a short time. 

That same year, Parker was noticed by critics when she appeared in a movie called "Longtime Companion". It was one of the first movies about AIDS. After that, she acted in 1991's "Grand Canyon", which also starred Mary McDonnell, Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard and Kevin Kline. Parker's next film was "Fried Green Tomatoes", with Jessica Tandy, Mary Stuart Masterson, Kathy Bates and Cicely Tyson.



Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) is an American group that works to make sure that LGBT are not made to look bad in the media, and works so that the public are more accepting of LGBT people. It was founded in 1985 in New York City after there were a lot of negative reports about LGBT people, after the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. Their policies are for the freedom to be homosexual and not be judged.

The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation was started in 1985 in New York City. After the start of the AIDS epidemic, several newspapers, like the "New York Post" wrote reports that some people thought were homophobic and unfair. The Alliance was founded to protest against such negative coverage in the media.

Because of this, a group of people decided to band together and begin a group to change things. They were Vito Russo, Gregory Kolovakos, Darryl Rist, Allen Barnett and Jewelle Gomez. They named their group the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. At first they were more concerned with changing the way that stories about AIDS were reported to the public. As the group grew, they began to work with people in the entertainment industry to change the way that gay and lesbian people were made to look on films and on television.

Every year, GLAAD hosts a ceremony where s are given to people in the media and in entertainment that have represented LGBT people and issues fairly. Since 2009, there have been three ceremonies every year, one each in New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

Don Carlos

Don Carlos is an opera composed by Giuseppe Verdi. It was composed to a libretto in the French language by Camille du Locle and Joseph Méry. It was based on a famous German play called "Don Carlos, Infante of Spain" by Friedrich Schiller. Schiller’s story is based on the true story of the life of Carlos, Prince of Asturias (1545-1568) who was promised that he could marry Elisabeth of Valois, but then his father,Philip II of Spain, changed his mind and married her himself. It was part of the peace treaty ending the Italian War of 1551-1559 between the Houses of Habsburg and Valois.

The opera was first performed at the Théâtre Impérial de l’Opéra in Paris on 11 March 1867. It has five acts.

Don Carlos was written for performance in Paris. This has made a problem for the reputation of the opera, because it was tradition in France to write very long operas. They always included a lot of ballet music as well as the singing. Verdi’s opera was in five acts, and when it was performed in other countries it was too long for people’s tastes, so many cuts were made, including, at first, the whole of Act I. This is a great pity, because a lot of the music in Act One is very important, with tunes which also come later in the opera. Since the beginning of the 20th century most of the music of Act I is usually performed. There have been many different versions performed, with different parts of the opera cut. When the opera is sung in Italian it is called "Don Carlo".

The story takes place at a time when Spain is just coming to the end of a war with France. It has been agreed between the two countries that Don Carlos, heir to the Spanish throne, will marry Elisabeth, the daughter of the King of France.

Don Carlos wants to see the girl he is to marry. He goes to France and, secretly, joins a royal hunt in which Elisabeth is taking part. Elisabeth and her page are separated from the others. Carlos speaks to her and offers to take her home. The princess asks him about the prince she is to marry. Carlos says that she need not worry because the prince is kind and in love with her. He then shows Elisabeth a photo of the prince, and then Elisabeth of course realizes that it is the prince she is talking to. They sing a love duet.

Some Spanish officials then come and tell Elisabeth that it has been decided that she is not to marry the prince: she is to marry his father, the king of Spain. The two lovers are dismayed at this news. The crowd of people beg Elisabeth to agree to marrying the King of Spain, so that the war will stop. In the end she agrees.

Don Carlos has gone to a monastery so that he can be quiet in his misery. His grandfather, Charles V, had spent his last days in this monastery. A monk talks to him. Carlos thinks the monk looks like his grandfather.

Carlos is filled with joy when his friend Rodrigue comes. He has just come back from Flanders, where there is still a lot of fighting. Carlos tells him a secret: that he is in love with Elisabeth who has now married his father and is therefore Queen of Spain. Rodrigue tells him he should spend his time helping the poor people of Flanders. The King and Queen process past the tomb.

When the Queen leaves the church she goes to the garden where her ladies are waiting for her. A messenger gives her a letter from her mother in Paris, but at the same time he secretly gives her a letter from Carlos. Rodrigue quietly talks to Eboli, the queen’s lady-in-waiting, while the queen reads the letters. Rodrigue asks the Queen to try to persuade the king to let Carlos talk to him. Eboli is in love with Carlos. She has noticed how Carlos has been agitated when he has been in the presence of the Queen, and thinks it is because Carlos loves her (Eboli).

Carlos is given a chance to meet Elisabeth privately. He calmly asks her whether she could persuade the King to send him to Flanders. However, he is not really calm, and soon he starts to be angry with her for not showing any love feelings towards him. She tells him that it is her duty now that she is Queen. Carlos understands, but is still in love with her. He falls at her feet. He grabs her and declares his love for her, but the Queen tears herself from him and he rushes off in despair.

The Kings comes out of church. He is very cross that his wife has been left on her own. He tells the lady-in-waiting to go away. The Queen comforts her. Then she and her ladies go.

Rodrigue asks the King to stop fighting the people of Flanders who are still dying and starving from hunger. The King says they were not faithful and deserve to be punished. He tells Rodrigue that he is afraid of what is going on between Elisabeth and Carlos. He tells him to be aware of the Inquisition.

A masked ball is taking place at the palace in Madrid. Carlos is waiting in the Queen’s garden. A lady comes to the garden, wearing a mask, like everyone else. He thinks it is the Queen and tells her how he loves her. When the lady takes her mask off he realizes it is Eboli. She accuses him of loving the Queen. At that moment Rodrigue comes. He says to Eboli that Carlos is not well and does not understand what he is talking about. But Eboli is not deceived and plans to ruin their love affair.

The second scene of the act takes place in a square in Madrid. An auto-da-fé is being prepared. During the time of the Spanish Inquisition this was a ceremony in which anyone who did not agree with the Roman Catholic church was burnt to death. Monks enter, followed by the unfortunate people who are going to be burnt. The people sing about the glories of Spain. King Philippe appears and repeats how he will fight against anyone who is an enemy of the Roman Catholic Church. Six people, including Carlos, appear and fling themselves at his feet, begging him to stop his troops from killing the Flemish people. The King will not hear of it. Some of the crowd support the king, but others are begging him to have mercy. Carlos then asks his father to allow him to rule Flanders for him. The King does not allow this, because he realizes that this could be an opportunity for Carlos and the Flemish people to rise against him. Carlos is desperate. He draws his sword and says that he will save Flanders. The crowd are terrified to see him behave like this in front of the King. The King commands his soldiers to take the sword away from Carlos, but no one obeys him. In the end, Rodrigue (who realizes that this is going to be bad for him) saves the situation by calmly asking Carlos for the sword. He hands it over and Rodrigue gives it to the King. The monks process farther, and a voice from heaven promises peace in the world to come.

The King is alone in church. In a wonderful aria he sings of his sadness that his wife does not seem to love him. The Grand Inquisitor comes in. He is very old, and blind. The King tells him about his son, and asks the Inquisitor whether Carlos should be forgiven or sentenced to death. The Inquisitor answers that it is Rodrigue who should be killed. The king dares to disagree. The Inquisitor tells the King that he is not giving his heart to God. The Inquisitor goes.

The Queen rushes in and asks the King to help her look for a casket of jewels which have disappeared from her room. The King shows her that it is on the table. He tells her she must open it. She does so. At the top is a portrait of Carlos. The King is very angry and accuses her of adultery. She faints. The King calles Eboli and Rodrigue for help. The King feels sorry for his suspicion, but Eboli feels even more sorry because it was she who had taken the casket because she was jealous of Carlos and Elisabeth. It was she who had suggested the King should look in the jewel case. Rodrigue feels he can only save his friend by offering himself to be killed instead of Carlos. The King and Rodrigue leave. Eboli throws herself at the feet of the Queen, who has now revived, and confesses that she herself is guilty of adultery because she had slept with the king. Elisabeth remains calm, but tells Eboli to go away from her for ever and to live in a nunnery. When Eboli is left alone she expresses her feelings of terribly misery. Before she goes to the nunnery she has one more thing to do: to try to save Carlos from being put to death.

The second scene of the act shows Carlos in prison. Rodrigue comes to him. He knows that Flemish letters addressed to Carlos have been found in his possession. Someone comes in and kills Rodrigue. As he dies, he tells Carlos that the Queen will wait for him the next day outside the nunnery and will see him for the last time. He dies.

Sometimes Act IV ends here, but some performances continue to show a scene in which the King tries to give the sword back to his son, but Carlos accuses him of having murdered his friend. A group of people, including Eboli, enter the prison and cry to the King to set Carlos free. The Inquisitor appears. He tells the crowd angrily that they are wicked to go against God’s will. He tells them all to go down on their knees and repent.

Elisabeth kneels before the tomb of Charles V. She sings of her lost youth in France (some of the music from Act I comes back here). She prays for peace. Elisabeth and Carlos then meet for the last time (their third duet in the opera) and wish for happier times. The King and the Inquisitor have been hiding. They now appear and grab Carlos. The guards are told to grab him, but Carlos defends himself. Suddenly the voice of Charles V (or a monk in disguise) is heard. He takes his grandson into the safety of the cloister.

Don Carlos is a great opera. It has some of Verdi’s greatest music, especially the music of Act IV scene i, in which the events of the previous acts are all brought together. There are some wonderful duets (three duets for Carlos and Elisabeth) and some great bass arias. However, the opera is very long, but it is difficult to cut any of the singing without spoiling the drama.

Some people feel that the end of the opera is weak. In Schiller’s play there is a different ending. Carlos is handed over to the Inquisition and put to death.

Don Carlos or Don Carlo may also refer to:



Carlos, Prince of Asturias

Carlos, Prince of Asturias, also known as Don Carlos (8 July 1545 – 24 July 1568), was the oldest son of King Philip II of Spain. He was heir apparent to the throne. His mother was Maria Manuela of Portugal. She was the daughter of John III of Portugal. 

Carlos went mad and so his father put him in prison in early 1568. Carlos died after half a year of solitary confinement. His sad fate became a theme for a play by Friedrich Schiller and an opera by Giuseppe Verdi.

Don Carlos (play)

Don Carlos () is a historical tragedy in five acts by Friedrich Schiller. It was written between 1783 and 1787. The main person in the play is Carlos, Prince of Asturias.

The play is about historical events in the 16th century under the reign of king Philip II of Spain.

The play was very different from the earlier ones that Schiller had written. It was written in iambic verse. It is a story about intrigue and misunderstanding.

In the play, Don Carlos loves his father's wife Elisabeth. The queen's lady-in-waiting Eboli loves Carlos. In the end, the Inquisition deliver a death sentence on Carlos.

Several operas have been composed on the basis of the play, including "Don Carlos" (also known as "Don Carlo") by Giuseppe Verdi.

Gloria Stuart

Gloria Frances Stewart (July 4, 1910 – September 26, 2010) also known as Gloria Stuart, was an American actress. She was one of the actors who set up the Screen Actors Guild. She became famous again when she had a part in the 1997 movie "Titanic".

Spanish Inquisition

The Spanish Inquisition was a tribunal started in 1478 in Spain. It was started by Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, with the assistance of Tomás de Torquemada. During the Spanish Inquisition many people were burnt in front of crowds in the streets. In practice, the Spanish Inquisition served to consolidate power in the monarchy of the newly unified Spanish kingdom, but it achieved that end through infamously brutal methods.

The rulers of Spain asked the Pope to start the Inquisition to catch Jews who pretended to be Christians. In 1492 they commanded all morisco to leave Spain. Many left, but many stayed and said they were Christians. The Inquisition became busy deciding which ones were lying. In 1502 the Muslims were also ordered out. Some parts of Spain actually enforced this order. When Protestants appeared, the Inquisition said they were just pretending to be Christians. Most trials ended with the defendant simply giving up his beliefs and being let go. The Inquisition became less active in later years and was completely abolished in 1834.


George B. McClellan

George Brinton McClellan (December 3, 1826 – October 29, 1885) was a Major general in Union army during the American Civil War. In 1861 and 1862, he was in charge of the Army of the Potomac. He led the Peninsular Campaign, an attempt to take Richmond, Virginia that didn't work. Though he won the Battle of Antietam, he did not get along with President Abraham Lincoln, who fired him. After he stopped being a general, he became a politician, and ran against Lincoln in the 1864 election. He was later Governor of New Jersey, though he was originally from Pennsylvania. He was also a prominent engineer, and was offered the job as President of the University of California.

He was seen as slow and thought all his fights through, training his soldiers very long. He was too slow acting for Abraham Lincoln's taste, who fired him several times. Mrs. Lincoln despised him greatly, therefore an influence of Mr. Lincoln's decision.

Rita Mae Brown

Rita Mae Brown (born November 28, 1944) is an American writer. She is best known for her first novel "Rubyfruit Jungle". It was published in 1973 and was a story about a young lesbian woman. At the time, it was quite unusual for novels to be about lesbian themes. Brown is also a mystery writer and an Emmy-nominated screenwriter.

Brown was born in Hanover, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Florida. In 2004 she was living outside Charlottesville, Virginia.

In the 1960s, Brown went to the University of Florida but transferred. She moved to New York and went to New York University, where she got a degree in classics and English. Later she got another degree in cinematography from the New York School of Visual Arts. She also got a doctorate in political science from the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C.

In the 1960s, Brown started to get involved in politics. She became active in the American Civil Rights Movement, the anti-war movement, the Gay Liberation movement and the feminist movement. She helped start the Student Homophile League and claims to have participated in the Stonewall riots in New York City, along with Martha Shelley. Ms. Shelley states that she was not in the bar with Ms. Brown at the time, and was simply passing by the riots, thinking they were an antiwar demonstration. Brown joined the new National Organization for Women, but left in February 1970 when Betty Friedan said anti-gay things and the organization tried to distance itself from lesbian organizations.

In the 1970s, she became helped start The Furies Collective, a lesbian feminist newspaper collective which said that heterosexuality was the cause of all oppression.

She has said, "I don't believe in straight or gay. I really don't. I think we're all degrees of bisexual."

Brown is openly lesbian and has had relationships with tennis player Martina Navratilova, actress-writer Fannie Flagg, socialite Judy Nelson, and politician Elaine Noble. Brown enjoys American fox hunting and is master of her Fox Hunt Club. She has also played polo, and started the women-only Blue Ridge Polo Club.


Gobi Desert

The Gobi (; , Govi , "semidesert"; ) is a desert in Mongolia and China. It is the largest desert in Asia, and the sixth largest in the world.

The desert basins of the Gobi are bounded by the Altai Mountains and the grasslands and steppes of Mongolia on the north, by the Hexi Corridor and Tibetan Plateau to the southwest, and by the North China Plain to the southeast. The Gobi is made up of several pieces of geological and geographic regions. 

This desert is home to many animals, such as the Bactrian Camel, Pit Viper, Mongolian wild ass, Gobi Bear and even Snow Leopards. There is also many types of wild sheep and goats around the desert. The most common vegetation is the gray sparrows saltwort, grey sagebrush and short grasses. 

The Gobi is a high plateau with daily and seasonal extremes of temperature.

Biofuel

Biofuel is fuel from recently lifeless or living biological material. It is different to fossil fuels from long dead biological material. Biofuel can be in forms of solid, liquid or gas. 

Biofuels are usually used to power cars, heat homes and for cooking. Biofuel companies are mainly from Europe, Asia and the Americas. Technologies developed at the Los Alamos National Lab even allows pollution to be converted into renewable biofuel. Agrofuels are biofuels that are produced from specific plants, rather than from waste processes such as landfill or recycled material. 

There are two common ways to convert plants into gas and liquid fuels. One is to grow crops that are high in sugar (e.g. Sugar cane) or starch (e.g. corn), and then use yeast to ferment ethyl alcohol (ethanol). The second is to grow plants that contain high amounts of vegetable oil, such as palm oil, soybean and algae. When these oils are heated, their viscosity is reduced, and they can be burned directly in a diesel engine, or chemically processed to produce fuels such as biodiesel. For thousands of years, Wood and its by-products have been converted into biofuels such as charcoal, wood gas, methanol or ethanol fuel. It is also possible to make cellulosic ethanol from non-edible plant parts, but this can be expensive.

Solid biomass is also used. Firewood has been used for thousands of years. Many materials such as wood and grasses can be dried and pelletised and burnt, and this can be used to produce power.

Ella Fitzgerald

Ella Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996), was an American jazz singer. She was called "Lady Ella", the "Queen of Jazz", and the "First Lady of Song".

Her voice spanned three octaves. She could sing very high notes and very low notes. She was famous for her scat singing. She won 14 Grammy Awards. She was awarded the National Medal of Art and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

Ella Fitzgerald was born in 1917 in Newport News, Virginia, United States to William and Temperance "Tempie" Fitzgerald. Soon after Ella was born, her parents separated. She went to live in Yonkers, New York with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, Joseph Da Silva. In 1923, Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances Da Silva, was born. When she was a child, Fitzgerald lived in the Colored Orphan Asylum in Riverdale, the Bronx.

As a youngster, Fitzgerald wanted to be a dancer. She loved listening to jazz music by Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and The Boswell Sisters. She especially liked the lead singer Connee Boswell, later saying, "My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it...I tried so hard to sound just like her."

In 1932, Fitzgerald's mother died. Ella began doing badly at school. At one time, she had a job as a lookout at a brothel and a job with some people with Mafia connections. She got into trouble with the police, and was sent to a reform school. She escaped from the reformatory, and for a time was homeless.

Fitzgerald had her first job as a singer when she was 17 on November 21, 1934 at the Harlem Opera House in Harlem, New York. She was able to compete in one of its famous "Amateur Nights". At first she was going to go on stage and dance but, intimidated by some local dancers, she decided to sing instead. She won the first prize of US$25 singing Connee Boswell's "Judy" and "The Object of My Affection".

In January 1935, Fitzgerald won the chance to perform for a week with the Tiny Bradshaw band at the Harlem Opera House. She met a drummer and bandleader called Chick Webb here. Webb had already hired a singer called Charlie Linton to work with the band. According to "The New York Times", Webb was "reluctant to sign her...because she was gawky and unkempt, a "diamond in the rough."" Webb let her try singing with his band when they played a dance at Yale University.

Fitzgerald began singing often with Webb's Orchestra during 1935, at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom. She recorded several hit songs with them, including "Love and Kisses" and "(If You Can't Sing It) You'll Have to Swing It (Mr. Paganini)". In 1938 she co-wrote and sang a version of the nursery rhyme, "A-Tisket, A-Tasket". After this, she started getting famous.

Chick Webb died on June 16, 1939, and his band was renamed "Ella Fitzgerald and her Famous Orchestra". Fitzgerald became the bandleader. She recorded nearly 150 sides during her time with the orchestra.

In 1942, Fitzgerald left the band and began to work as a solo singer. She was signed to the Decca label, and she had several popular hit songs. She recording with other musicians like the Ink Spots, Louis Jordan, and the Delta Rhythm Boys.

Decca's Milt Gabler became her manager and she began working often for the jazz producer Norman Granz. She often sang in his Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts. Then, Granz became her manager, but he did not record her on any of his record labels for nearly a decade.

In the mid-1940s, after the swing era, and the end of the great touring big bands, jazz music became quite different. A new kind of jazz called bebop became popular and Fitzgerald changed her style of singing. She worked with Dizzy Gillespie's big band and started including scat singing as a big part of her performances. About singing with Gillespie, Fitzgerald said, "I just tried to do [with my voice] what I heard the horns in the band doing."

Her 1945 scat recording of "Flying Home" was later described by "The New York Times" as "one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decade...Where other singers, most notably Louis Armstrong, had tried similar improvisation, no one before Miss Fitzgerald employed the technique with such dazzling inventiveness." Her be-bop recording of "Oh, Lady be Good!" (1947) was also very popular, and made people think of her as one of the most important jazz singers.

Granz did not like some of the music Fitzgerald was given at this time, so during her last years on the Decca label she recorded some duets with pianist Ellis Larkins, released in 1950 as "Ella Sings Gershwin".

In 1955, Fitzgerald left Decca, and joined Granz's new record label, Verve Records. She said later, "I had gotten to the point where I was only singing bebop. I thought bebop was 'it', and that all I had to do was go some place and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing. I realized then that there was more to music than bop. Norman...felt that I should do other things, so he produced "The Cole Porter Songbook" with me. It was a turning point in my life."

A new album, "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook", was released in 1956. It was the first of eight multi-album "Songbook" sets that she would record for Verve between 1956 and 1964. Many of the songs were standards and Fitzgerald tried to cross over into a non-jazz audience.

"Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook" was the only "Songbook" on which the composer of the songs also played with her. Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, who had worked together for a long time, both played on half the set's 38 tracks, and wrote two new pieces of music for the album: "The E and D Blues", and a musical piece about Fitzgerald (the only "Songbook" track that Fitzgerald does not sing on).

The "Songbook" series became the Fitzgerald's most critically acclaimed and popular work. "The New York Times" wrote in 1996, "These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration."

Ella Fitzgerald also recorded albums of the songs of Cole Porter and George Gershwin in 1972 and 1983. The albums were called "Ella Loves Cole" and "Nice Work If You Can Get It". A later album of songs by a single composer was released when she was with Pablo Records, "Ella Abraça Jobim", with songs by Antonio Carlos Jobim.

While she was recording the "Songbooks" and the occasional studio album, Fitzgerald toured 40 to 45 weeks per year in the United States and internationally, with Norman Granz. Granz helped her to become one of the most important live jazz performers.

In the mid-1950s, Fitzgerald became the first African-American to perform at the Mocambo (a Hollywood nightclub), after Marilyn Monroe had persuaded the owner to make the booking. This was very important in Fitzgerald's career. The event was turned into a play by Bonnie Greer which is to receive a production in London's West End from November 2009.

Some live albums on Verve that she recorded are well thought of by critics: "Ella at the Opera House", "" and "".

In later life, Fitzgerald kept a busy concert schedule, but her health worsened. She had heart surgery in 1986. She had diabetes, which accounted for her failing eyesight. Her diabetes worsened, and both legs were cut off (amputated) below the knees. She never completely recovered. She was unable to perform often. She spent time with family. Fitzgerald died in her Beverly Hills, California home on June 15, 1996 from a stroke. She was interred in the Sunset Mission Mausoleum at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.

By the 1990s, Fitzgerald had recorded more than 200 songs. In 1991, she gave her final concert at Carnegie Hall. She had performed there 26 times. She received numerous awards. In 1979, she received Kennedy Center Honors. In 1987, she received the National Medal of Arts. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. France presented her with the Commander of Arts and Letters award. Yale University, Dartmouth, and other schools awarded her honorary doctorates. Several of Fitzgerald's awards, significant personal possessions, and documents were given to the Smithsonian Institution, the library of Boston University, the Library of Congress, and the Schoenberg Library at UCLA.

In 1941, Fitzgerald married Benny Kornegay, a convicted drug dealer. The marriage was annulled after two years. In December 1947, she married double bass player Ray Brown. They adopted a child of Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances. They named him Ray Brown, Jr.. Fitzgerald and Brown divorced in 1953.

In July 1957, Reuters reported that Fitzgerald had secretly married Thor Einar Larsen, a young Norwegian, in Oslo. The affair was quickly forgotten when Larsen was sentenced to five months hard labor in Sweden for stealing money from a young woman.
