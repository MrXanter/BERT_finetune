K–Ar dating

Potassium–Argon dating or K–Ar dating is a radiometric dating method used in geochronology, which is part of geology. It is based on measurement of the product of the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium (K) into argon (Ar).

Potassium is a common element found in many materials, such as micas, clay, tephra, and evaporites. In these materials, the decay product Ar is able to escape the liquid (molten) rock, but starts to build up when the rock solidifies (recrystallises). Time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of Ar to the amount of K remaining. The long half-life of K is more than a billion years, so the method is used to calculate the absolute age of samples much older than a few thousand years.

Quickly cooled lavas make nearly ideal samples for K–Ar dating. They also preserve a record of the direction and intensity of the local magnetic field at that time. The geomagnetic reversal time scale was calibrated largely using K–Ar dating.

Uranium-lead dating

Uranium-lead is one of the oldest and most refined of the radiometric dating schemes. 

It can be used over an age range of about 1 million years to over 4.5 billion years. Precision is in the 0.1-1 percent range. 

The method relies on two separate decay chains, the uranium series from U to Pb, with a half-life of 4.47 billion years and the actinium series from U to Pb, with a half-life of 704 million years.

The existence of two 'parallel' uranium-lead decay routes allows several dating techniques within the overall U-Pb system. 

The term 'U-Pb dating' normally implies the coupled use of both decay schemes. However, use of a single decay scheme (usually U to Pb) leads to the U-Pb isochron dating method, analogous to the rubidium-strontium dating method. 

Finally, ages can also be determined from the U-Pb system by analysis of Pb isotope ratios alone. This is termed the lead-lead dating method. Clair Cameron Patterson, an American geochemist who pioneered studies of uranium-lead radiometric dating methods, is famous for having used it to obtain one of the earliest accurate estimates of the age of the Earth.

Uranium-lead dating is usually performed on the mineral zircon (ZrSiO), though it can be used on other minerals. Zircon incorporates uranium and thorium atoms into its crystalline structure, but strongly rejects lead. Therefore, we can assume that the entire lead content of the zircon is radiogenic. Where this is not the case, a correction must be applied. Uranium-lead dating techniques have also been applied to other minerals such as calcite/aragonite and other carbonate minerals. These minerals often produce lower precision ages than igneous and metamorphic minerals traditionally used for age dating, but are more common in the geologic record.

Mälaren

Lake Mälaren is the third largest lake in Sweden after Lakes Vänern and Vättern. Its surface area is 1,140 km², its average depth is 12 meters and its greatest depth is 64 m. The lake drains, from southwest to northeast, into the Baltic Sea. The two largest islands in Mälaren are Selaön (91 km²) and Svartsjölandet (79 km²). The lake was previously known as Løgrinn. The Viking settlements Birka on the island of Björkö and Hovgården on the neighbouring island Adelsö have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993, as has Drottningholm Palace on the island of Lovön.

Game Maker

Game Maker is a computer program for the Windows operating system. It was first made by Mark Overmars, but it is now made by the company YoYo Games.

Game Maker lets people make computer games without knowing a computer programming language. People who know how to use programming languages can use Game Maker's own programming language, called Game Maker Language.

The newest version is Game Maker Studio. Since the first version made in 1999, Game Maker was given many new features. One of these features is 3-D graphics.

Game Maker has a drag-and-drop interface. This lets people make games using mostly the computer mouse. Game Maker uses icons that tell the person what actions they can do. People can make simple games by moving these icons into a given order. More detailed games can be made when Game Maker Language is used.

Game Maker has an internet community and website. There, people who use Game Maker can put their games up for others to play. People can also get help on using Game Maker from other people.

Game Maker started as an animation program called "Animo". Each new version of Game Maker added new features. Starting with version 7.0, Game Maker was published by the YoYo Games company. 

In May 22, 2012, YoYo Games released GM:Studio. After that GM:HTML5 is no longer supported.GM:Studio allows users to publish their games to Windows, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, Linux Ubuntu and HTML5.

Bevacizumab

Bevacizumab is an anti-angiogenic drug that is used in the treatment of Metastatic Renal cell carcinoma, Metastatic breast cancer, Non-small cell lung cancer, and is also approved in the treatment Glioblastoma multiforme.

Metastatic breast cancer

Metastatic breast cancer is Breast cancer that has spread beyond the primary tumor. It is incurable, but may be treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and Hormonal therapy including Tamoxifen. Recently Bevacizumab was approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, along with Paclitaxel. Zometa is effective in treatment if the patient has Bone metastases.

Bone metastasis

Bone metastases are when a cancer spreads to the bones. This is called metastasis. People with breast and prostate cancer have more bone metastases than other cancers. However, almost any other cancer can spread to the bone. 

Symptoms of bone metastases include:

Hypercalcemia

Hypercalcemia is too much calcium in the body. It is usually caused by either cancer or parathyroid disease. If hypercalcemia is severe, it may cause changes in mental status. Other symptoms can include nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, and thirst.
Hypercalcemia can be asscociated with Sarcoidosis or Tuberculosis.

Eoghan Quigg (born 12 July 1992) is a pop singer based in the United Kingdom and Ireland. He has been active since 2008 when he was a contestent on "The X Factor" where he finished in third place. In Ireland he has had a number 1 album called "Eoghan Quigg". Quigg was going to be signed by Simon Cowell, CEO of Syco Records, but was instead signed to RCA.

Imhotep

Imhotep was a high priest and a doctor in ancient Egypt. Imhotep also became famous as an architect. Imhotep was the architect, physician, scribe, and chief advisor of the 3rd-Dynasty pharaoh Djoser. He was later worshipped as a god. As a god, he was often pictured seated, wearing a long kilt robe and a skull cap or a shaven head. He had a papyrus scroll spread on his lap to show he was a scribe and a scholar. 

As an architect, Imhotep was most famous because he was the designer of the step pyramid at Sakkara. Before the step pyramid, pharaohs were buried in flat topped buildings called mastabas. The term mastaba comes from the word meaning bench, because they look like the benches most Egyptians placed outside their door. An average mastaba had four walls, a flat top and an underground burial chamber, reached by a vertical shaft or stairwell.The step pyramid was actually just a number of mastabas placed one on top of the other, each one smaller than the previous one. There were also a couple of small rooms above the burial chambers with items for the afterlife. 

Imhotep’s best-known writings were medical scrolls. He is thought to have written the Edwin Smith papyrus. The papyrus lists 48 injuries of which 27 are head trauma, and six are spine trauma. Here’s an example for treatment of a head injury:
“Examination: If thou examinest a man having a wound in his head, while his wound does not have two lips, penetrating to the bone of his skull, (but) not having a gash, thou shouldst palpate his wound (or, thou shouldst lay thy hand upon it); shouldst thou find his skull uninjured, not having a perforation; a split, or a smash in it. Treatment: Thou shouldst bind it with fresh meat the first day (and) treat afterwards with grease, honey (and) lint every day until he recovers wound in the head” 

Around 100 years after his death, Imhotep was deified (made into a god). Imhotep became the god of medicine and healing. Small temples were built in honor of him. People with injuries would sleep near his temple hoping to be healed. As a god, Imhotep was also worshiped by scribes. Scribes would offer a couple drops of water as a sacrifice to him before starting to write. Because of his attachment with the god Ptah during his work at Ptah's temple, stories were spread that said that Ptah was his father. 

Even when the Greeks took over Egypt in 331 B.C.E., he was identified with another deified man called Asclepius, and the Greeks continued to honor and build temples for him. 



Ablai Khan

Wali-ullah Abul-Mansur Khan, better known as Ablai Khan (1711–1781) was a ruler of the Kazakh Khanate, which is now in Kazakhstan. He became Khan (king) in 1736. Ablai became an orphan when he was a child. He was already famous as a warrior when he was 20 after he killed a great Dgungarian knight.

During Abilay Khan's rule, the Kazakh Khanate protected their eastern borders from Dgungarian invasion. They also had to protect their northern borders from Tatarian and Bashkirian tribes. When the Dgungarian Khanate was defeated by China, Abilay Khan defended the country from a Chinese invasion.

Ablai Khan was a diplomat and a fearless military leader. He united all Kazakh tribes into a strong country. Today, the people of Kazakhstan see him as the father of united Kazakhstan.

Turkmen Alabai

Liver disease

Liver disease is any disease affecting the liver.

There are many forms of liver disease. Forms include:

Hepatocellular carcinoma

Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most frequently encountered type of liver cancer. It is more common in those with cirrhosis of the liver. If localized to the liver and small at the time of diagnosis, it can be surgically treated. If metastatic, it may be treated with Nexavar, an oral medication approved in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver transplantation may be used in some cases.



NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition

The NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition, at first called the National Hockey League All-Star Skills Competition, is an event on the night before the NHL All-Star Game. First held at the 41st National Hockey League All-Star Game in Pittsburgh in 1990, the NHL hosts the competition to show off the skills of the all-star players. Events include shot accuracy, fastest skater, puck control relay, hardest shot, breakaway challenge, and an elimination shootout. Players are put into teams in the same way the All-Star Game is done, which is by conferences. After each event, the winning conference is given points.
This event is to show who is the fastest skater while also moving the puck through pylons. Two races happen; the first one has three skaters on each team race against each other, and the second has the best single racers from each team. One point is given out to the winner of each of these two events.
This event is to see who can skate the fastest around the rink once. Two races are held; one for the team, and one for the faster single person.

This event shows who has the hardest shot. Two points are given out; one for the team that has the highest average shot, and one for the player with the hardest shot. Zdeno Chara has the record for hardest shot; he set the record in 2009 when his shot went 105.4 mph. Al Iafrate had the old record, which was 105.2 mph

This event sees who can shoot four targets best. Each target is put in a corner of the net. Two points are given out; one point is for the team that hits the targets in the least amount of shots, and one point for the player who hits the targets in the least amount of shots. A player has hit all four targets in only four tries seven times: Ray Bourque in 1992 and 1993, Mark Messier in 1996, Jeremy Roenick in 2004, Tomas Kaberle in 2008, and Dany Heatley, and Evgeni Malkin in 2009.

This event has players shoot on a goalie. Two points are awarded; one for the team that scores the most goals, and one point to the goalie who lets in the least amount of goals. Starting in 2008, players were given points on who could score the most creative goals. Winners were voted on by fans voting with text messages.

This event has players try to score on a breakaway against a goalie. When a player does not score, he is not allowed to compete anymore. The winner is the player who is the last one still playing.


Henrik Sedin

Henrik Sedin (born 26 September 1980) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey centre. He played a total of 17 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He spent his entire NHL career with the Vancouver Canucks playing alongside his identical twin brother Daniel. He served as the captain of the Canucks from 2010 until 2018. The Sedins were known for the way in which they helped each other play. Henrik, a good passer, was known to help set up goals, while Daniel was known to score goals.

Henrik started his career in the Swedish Elite League with Modo Hockey in 1997 and won the Golden Puck as Swedish player of the year in 1999, winning it with Daniel. He was picked third by the Canucks in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. Henrik has played his entire NHL career in Vancouver and has led the team in scoring the past six seasons, from 2007–08 to 2012-2013. In 2009–10, he won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's top point scorer, setting Canucks' records for assists and points in a season as well as the team record for career assists. Henrik also won the Hart Trophy as the NHL's Most Valuable Player for the 2009-10 season.

Internationally, Henrik has played for Sweden and won a gold medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, as well as two bronze medals at the 1999 and 2001 World Championships.

On April 5, 2018, the Sedin twins played their last game in Rogers Arena against the Arizona Coyotes. Henrik played his last game on April 7, 2018 and retired alongside his brother after the 2017–18 NHL season. The Sedins both won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy at the end of the season, making it the first time two brothers shared the trophy.

On February 12, 2020, a ceremony took place which celebrated the Sedins' career. During the event, Henrik's jersey number 33 and Daniel's number 22 were retired and raised to the rafters of Rogers Arena. On 28 June 2022, Henrik and Daniel became the first Canucks inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. 


Hepatoblastoma

Hepatoblastoma is a rare form of Liver cancer occurring most frequently in children. Treatment consists of Surgery and Chemotherapy. If all of the cancer is removed during surgery, the prognosis is excellent, but if cancer is left behind, the prognosis is much worse.

Smythe Division

The Smythe Division was one of the playing divisions of the National Hockey League (NHL). It was formed in 1974, and was part of the new Clarence Campbell Conference. A conference is a group of divisions. The division was named after Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs from 1927 to 1961. In 1993, the league divisions changed, and most of the Smythe Division became the Pacific Division. The Smythe Division won the Stanley Cup six times.
The first teams that played in the Smythe Division were:
The Canucks were the only team moved from the old East Division. The Blackhawks, Blues, and North Stars were moved from the old West Division. The Scouts were a new team. The Scouts now play as the New Jersey Devils. The North Stars now play as the Dallas Stars.
The new Patrick Division was also in the Clarence Campbell Conference. The other conference was the Prince of Wales Conference. The East Division and the new Adams Division were in the Prince of Wales Conference. This was the first year for conferences in the NHL. The old West Division teams were moved into all of the new divisions.
In 1976, the Scouts moved to Denver, Colorado and started playing as the Colorado Rockies.
In 1978, the North Stars move to the Adams Division.

In 1979, the World Hockey Association (WHA) went out of business. Four teams from the WHA join the NHL. The Edmonton Oilers and the Winnipeg Jets join the Smythe Division.

In 1981, the NHL changed the conference and division lineups. A number of teams moved to new divisions and conferences. The Blackhawks and the Blues left the Smythe Division for the Norris Division, which was now a part of the Clarence Campbell Conference.
The Calgary Flames left the Patrick Division, and the Los Angeles Kings left the Norris Division. Both teams joined the Smythe Division. The Smythe Division now had the following teams:

In 1982 the Rockies moved to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey and started playing as the New Jersey Devils. They also joined the Patrick Division.
The Winnipeg Jets moved from the Norris Division to the Smythe Division.

The division lineup stayed the same until 1991, when a new team, the San Jose Sharks was formed in San Jose, California and joined the Smythe Division.
In 1993, the NHL again changed the conferenes and divisions. The Eastern Conference contained the Northeast Division and the Atlantic Division. The Western Conference contained Central Division and the Pacific Division. The Jets were moved to the Central Division. All the other teams in the Smythe Division were moved to the Pacific Division. They were joined by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, a new team that played in Anaheim, California.

In 1984, the Oilers were the first team in the Smythe Division to win the Stanley Cup. They also won the Stanley Cup in 1985, 1987, and 1988. In 1989, the Flames won the Stanley Cup. In 1990, the Oilers won the last Stanley Cup for the Smythe division.

Kansas City Scouts

The Kansas City Scouts was a National Hockey League (NHL) team. They were an expansion (new addition) team to the league in 1974. They played two seasons in Kansas City, Missouri. While in Kansas City, they were a member of the Smythe Division. They were named the Scouts, after a well-known statue from the city. The team then moved to Denver, Colorado, and changed their name to the Colorado Rockies. In 1982, they moved again to New Jersey, and changed their name to the New Jersey Devils.

Diamondback rattlesnake

The diamondback rattlesnake is a very poisonous rattlesnake. Diamondbacks are found from Florida to California. The bite from a big rattlesnake can hold enough poison to kill a person. However, if the victim gets to a doctor quickly enough, he or she can usually survive. People who spend time in regions where diamondback rattlesnakes live should take a few precautions. People must be especially careful around caves. Rattlesnakes sometimes hibernate in caves during cool weather. People can listen carefully for its unusual rattling noise, to know where it is hiding.

Carambola

Carambola ("Averrhoa carambola"), also known as star fruit, is a tropical fruit. The fruit grows on trees that are native to India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. Star fruit is common in the south of Asia, Australia and all of the islands around Australia. The tree is also grown in tropic islands. 

The carambola has been growing in parts of Asia for hundreds of years. It may have first been in Sri Lanka and Moluccas. Malaysia grows the most carambola in the world and it also grows in Bangladesh.
Because of insects and disease, whole carambolas cannot be taken into the USA. In the USA, star fruit is grown in Florida, Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, California, Texas, Arizona, Puerto Rico and Hawaii. 

Star fruit tastes best ripe (yellow with a little green). It will also be brown on the five edges and feel hard. If the star fruit is overripe it will be yellow with brown spots. You can eat all of the fruit, even the skin. It is sweet and very juicy. The taste is a little bit like a subtle mix of papaya, orange and grapefruit.

The Carambola is a tropical fruit. In Northern India, it grows up to 4,000 feet in elevation. It prefers a total exposure to the sun but requires high humidity and a total of 70 inches or more of rainfall a year. It requires good drainage of the soil.

Carambola trees are planted 20 feet or more from each other. They grow fast and makes fruit when they are four or five years old. The rain during Spring makes the amount of fruit lower. In perfect conditions, Carambola can make from 200 to 400 pounds of fruit a year. The fruit is picked mainly during the months of June, July, and August.

Major pests are fruit flies, ants, and birds. In the United States, they are also vulnerable to frosts.

Super Mario

Super Mario is the biggest and most important sub-series of the "Mario" series. It started in 1985 with the creation of Super Mario Bros. on the Famicom and later on the Nintendo Entertainment System (also called NES). It has been followed by many sequels released in almost every Nintendo video game console to date, except the Game Boy, the Game Boy Color, the Game Boy Advance, and the Virtual Boy, where only remakes, ports, or other spin-offs games where released.

Most of these games, except "Super Mario Bros. 2", "", and the "Super Mario Land "series", "are about Mario and, normally, his brother Luigi and sometimes his best friend Yoshi, in their adventure to search for and save Princess Peach from Bowser, who wants to takeover the Mushroom Kingdom, or another place, depending on the game. The Mario brothers' adventure is not easy, however, as they need to face Bowser's troops all over, who try to stop the brothers' attempts to save the princess.

All the games, and even some remakes, have been started by the Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development (also called Nintendo EAD) branch but not by the same area.

In 2010, the series celebrated the twenty-fifth of the release of "Super Mario Bros.". The celebration included a series of videos showing various tricks throughout the series' games on the Wii's Nintendo Channel, as well as releasing a Wii port of "Super Mario All-Stars", which included a history booklet of the "Super Mario" series and a CD containing several songs from games in the series.

Super Mario Bros.

This game is the first in the "Super Mario" series. It was made for the Famicom and the NES in 1985. This game set the way for the later games, and it was later re-released for many newer systems, including the Game Boy Advance and the Virtual Console for the Wii. This game marks the first appearance for many new heros, species, and villains. These characters include Bowser, Princess Peach (then called Princess Toadstool), Toad and the Mushroom Retainers, Goombas, Koopa Troopas, and many more.

A year after "Super Mario Bros.", Nintendo put out this game. It was made for the Famicom Disk System. It uses a slightly different form of "Super Mario Bros."'s engine, with different levels and new features including different graphics and the enemies acting a different way. This game is called Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan; Nintendo of America originally thought this game was too hard and too much like the first to sell well in the United States. However, this game came in United States as part of "Super Mario All-Stars", and recently, this game was on the Virtual Console on the Wii.

Super Mario Bros. 2

After seeing that the Lost Levels was too hard, they did not release it in North America and Europe. Instead they remade Doki Doki Panic with Mario characters. You can play as Mario, Luigi, Toad and Peach, each with their own powers and abilities. They need to free Subcon from the evil frog Wart. The game has been included in remakes, such as Super Mario All-Stars and on Virtual Console.
Super Mario Bros. 3

This is the fourth "Super Mario" game. It was made for the Famicom and the NES. Many new species appear, including main ones like Boo and Spike. Boom Boom, Dry Bones, and the Koopalings also first appear here. New power-ups also appear such as the Super Leaf, the Hammer Suit and the Frog Suit. It has been believed to be one of the greatest games of all time. Its hard and tricky levels made it a huge success. It has new power ups, new moves, items, and enemies. It also has special non-level parts of each world, including Toad Houses where lives are gotten and Spade Panels, as well as some secret parts, such as the White Toad House and the Treasure Ship.

Super Mario World

This game was released in 1990 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (also called SNES). It was also re-released as the second game in the "Super Mario Advance" series. In this game Mario and Peach go on a trip to Dinosaur Land but things go wrong when Bowser kidnaps Peach. This game was special for creating Yoshi and the species. It is the fifth game in the "Super Mario" series.

Super Mario 64

This game has its own special gameplay and story to the "Super Mario" series. It was released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64. In this game, Mario uses Power Stars to bring back the kidnapped Peach. Mario jumps into paintings trying to find Peach. Unlike games before, the way to win the levels in this game is not to find the end of the level; instead, Mario needs to find Power Stars by finishing missions in each course. This is also the first 3D game in this series. Though it was not the first 3-D platforming game, it transformed the genre, with many games soon following its formula, using it as a sort of guide. It is widely celebrated as one of the greatest games of all time. A remake for this game came out in 2004 for the Nintendo DS called "Super Mario 64 DS". This game brought in new bosses, such as King Bob-omb and Eyerok.

Super Mario Sunshine

This game was released in 2002 for the Nintendo GameCube. Its gameplay is almost like "Super Mario 64"; however, it has a different storyline. Mario, Princess Peach, and Toadsworth are taking a vacation to Isle Delfino, when they find that the island has been ruined and the Shine Sprites stolen by a strange enemy that looks like Mario himself. Mario is then taken into custody and has to get a job cleaning up the entire island. Instead of collecting Power Stars, the player collects Shine Sprites. This game also introduced many recurring characters and bosses in the Mario series, including Toadsworth, Bowser Jr., Petey Piranha, Gooper Blooper, Piantas, Nokis, Shadow Mario, and FLUDD. "Super Mario Galaxy" is the sequel to this game. This is the second 3D game in the series.

New Super Mario Bros.

This game is the eighth in the "Super Mario" series. It starts out when Bowser Jr. kidnaps Peach during a strange accident. Luigi can be played in this game, too. Luigi could not be played since "Super Mario World". This is the first game since "Super Mario World" (1990) that features the classic 2D play-style of the "Super Mario Bros." games. The game features a solo story mode with Mario or Luigi, a two-player wireless game Mario vs. Luigi, as well as a mini-game mode for up to four players. It was released in 2006 for the Nintendo DS. "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" is the sequel, though that game is not thought to be a direct sequel to the DS game.

Super Mario Galaxy

This game is the ninth in the "Super Mario" series and the third 3D game in the series. It is different than the first two 3D games for the "Mario" series, this game takes place in deep space. Mario goes to the Star Festival because Princess Peach asks him, when the town comes under attack by Bowser's air forces. He steals Peach's castle and sends it to the center of the universe, making Mario have to save her. Most of the game's levels includes many small planets and asteriods, while others have bigger planets. A new popular species and character appear, Luma and Rosalina. It was released in 2007 for the Wii. This game has a direct sequel, called "Super Mario Galaxy 2". It is the only 3D game that has a direct sequel.

New Super Mario Bros. Wii

This game is the tenth in the "Super Mario" series and the second for the Wii. It is an indirect sequel to "New Super Mario Bros.". In this game, Yoshis are can be ridden and the Koopalings return. It has single-player and multiplayer mode for up to four players at the same time. This is the first time more than one player can play at the same time in a "Super Mario" game. Two new characters that can be played appear, Yellow Toad and Blue Toad. New power-ups also appear including the Propeller Suit and the Penguin Suit.

Super Mario Galaxy 2

This is the eleventh in the "Super Mario" series. It is also the fourth 3D game in the series. The sequel contains many things from the first game, such as the story, the adventure being in outer space, objects such as Launch Stars, recurring items including the Bee Mushroom, and things about gravity. The game shows new things such as the use of Yoshi and new power-ups such as the Cloud Flower. Rosalina reappears and new characters of the Luma species appear including Lubba. This is the third game for the Wii in the "Super Mario" series.

Super Mario 3D Land

This is the fifth 3D game in the series, and the twelfth game in the "Super Mario" series. The levels of this game are much more straight and flat than the other 3D games, almost like side-scrolling games. Many past power-ups and characters return, such as False Bowsers, the Super Leaf and Boom Boom. There are new power-ups, such as Boomerang Mario, and White Tanooki Mario. There are also new enemies and a female partner of Boom Boom named Pom Pom.

New Super Mario Bros. 2

This game is another side-scroller in the series released in 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS. It's the third game in the "New Super Mario Bros. "series and a direct sequel to "New Super Mario Bros.". The game has lots of coins, and Raccoon Mario is back after not being in a game for a long time. A new power-up called the Gold Flower turns Mario into Gold Mario.

New Super Mario Bros. U

This game is a side-scroller for the Wii U. The game uses some things from "Super Mario World" like Baby Yoshis, Sumo Bros., Bony Beetles, and diagonal pipess. The game is very much the same as "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" with its four-player mode, what is different is a player with a Wii U GamePad can make platforms in what Nintendo calls "Boost Mode". It is the first "Super Mario" game (and "Mario" game) in high-definition. Flying Squirrel Mario is new.

Super Mario 3D World

This game is the console sequel to "Super Mario 3D Land". The game lets the player turn into Cat Mario by picking up a Super Bell. Everyone who could be played in "Super Mario Bros. 2" can be played again, with the same exact power. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Toad try to save the Sprixie Princesses that Bowser has kidnapped and save the Sprixie Kingdom.

Super Mario Odyssey

This game is an open-world 3D platformer. The game introduces Cappy, a new character in the Mario series. He allows Mario to control objects and characters, in which the game calls "capturing." In the game, Mario and Cappy chase Bowser across different worlds, as he has kidnapped Princess Peach. The game was released on October 27, 2017.

Super Mario Bros. (handheld)

In 1987, an easier "Super Mario Bros." was released for the Game & Watch. It is a sidescroller where Mario had to move over many platforms while keeping away from Lakitus and Bullet Bills.

Super Mario All-Stars

This game (called Super Mario Collection in Japan) was released in 1993 also for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is a remake of the first four "Super Mario" series games. "Super Mario Bros.", "Super Mario Bros. 2", "Super Mario Bros. 3", and "". This game changed the four games' graphics and sound to make them better.

Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World

This game is an America/Europe-only remake of "Super Mario All-Stars" that also has "Super Mario World" for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the second remake of the series.

Super Mario Bros. Deluxe

This game is a Game Boy Color remake which includes the first two "Super Mario" games ever released: "Super Mario Bros." and "Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels" (Super Mario Bros.: For Super Players). It also has many other collectibles, like images that could be printed with the Game Boy Printer, a calendar, and a fortune teller. Unlike other remakes, it was not developed by Nintendo EAD, but by Nintendo Research & Development 2 (also called Nintendo R&D2).

Super Mario Advance

This game is a remake of "Super Mario Bros. 2" made for the Game Boy Advance, and released in 2001. Like "Super Mario All-Stars", this game had changed graphics.

This game is a remake of "Super Mario World" made for the Game Boy Advance. It was the second in the "Super Mario Advance" series and was released in 2002. There are many differences between "Super Mario World" and this game. The game was a gigantic hit for Nintendo and the Game Boy Advance, selling 3,290,000 copies in the United States and 5,460,000 copies worldwide. Luigi's sprite (video game graphic) has been changed and made taller than Mario, like how he looks now, and "Mario Bros." has been put in the game.

n 2003, the fourth in the "Super Mario Advance" series, was released for the Game Boy Advance. It is much the same graphics and sound to the "Super Mario All-Stars" form, and made use of the e-Reader. A few e-cards came with new copies of the game, while two sets (called "series") of cards, were released and sold with the game. By scanning special cards into the e-Reader, players were able to send items, videos, and most importantly, new levels into the game. One important item was the Cape Feather from "Super Mario World", which let Mario change into Cape Mario. There were also two Switch cards that the player could turn on (and turn off) the effects of by scanning them; the Orange Switch and the Blue Green Switch. Scanning these switches set off small uses in the game. The e-Reader item is still available in the European form, but has been turned off and cannot be used anymore.

The NES form of "Super Mario Bros." was released for the Game Boy Advance as part of the "Classic NES" series of games in celebrating and remembering for the 20th anniversary of the release of the first Famicom and NES. It does not have any new additions, all of the errors were left in the game, and the graphics were shrank to fit the GBA screen size.

In Japan, the "Classic NES" series was called Famicom Mini. Super Mario Bros. 2 ("Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels") was released only in Japan. Much like "Super Mario Bros.", it did not have any new items, the errors were the same, and the graphics shrank.

Super Mario 64 DS

This game is a remake of "Super Mario 64". It was released in 2004 for the Nintendo DS. It is also the first "Mario" game released for the Nintendo DS. Though it is a remake, there are many differences between it and the first. One difference is that there are many secret stars, making 150 Power Stars instead of 120. Wario, Luigi, and Yoshi can be played, and mini-games were added.

Super Mario All-Stars Limited Edition

Released for the Wii in 2010, this game celebrates the 25th anniversary of Mario by having the same games as "Super Mario All-Stars".

New Super Luigi U

This is a game released to praise the Year of Luigi. It keeps many of the same things from "New Super Mario Bros. U", such as the story and world map. It has also been released as a DLC title for "New Super Mario Bros. U". However all of the levels have been changed, and Mario is gone, making Luigi the main character. Nabbit can be played, taking the place of Mario. The boxed form was for sale until the end of the Year of Luigi (2013).

New Super Mario Bros. U + New Super Luigi U

A collection of both "New Super Mario Bros. U" and "New Super Luigi U" on the same disc, released with the Mario & Luigi Deluxe Wii U set (known as the Premium Pack in Europe) only. This game has changes to the originals, including a new title screen and over 200 videos included as a present.

New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe

A collection of both "New Super Mario Bros. U" and "New Super Luigi U" on the same game card, released with some new additions to "New Super Mario Bros. U +" "New Super Luigi U." It was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2019.

Super Mario Land

It plays much the same to the games on the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was the first game to have Princess Daisy instead of Princess Peach. The goal of the player is to beat Tatanga and save Princess Daisy. Mario can beat enemies by jumping on their head, but some cannot be beaten this way. It released on Virtual Console in 2011 on 3DS.

This is the second in the "Super Mario Land" series, released in 1992, three years after "Super Mario Land". This is the first game to have Wario, the main rival of Mario. In this game, it is made known that what happened in "Super Mario Land" was made by Wario so that he could take over the castle Mario owned. He uses the power of six magic coins to lock the castle, leaving them to the care of eight of his assistants (including Tatanga) so that Mario cannot get inside. Now, Mario needs to travel through six different worlds to get those coins and his castle back from the money-grabbing anti-hero. This game has better graphics, as well as a save feature, which is not present in "Super Mario Land" because of its short length. However, it keeps the same Mario-style gameplay and even brings back the Fire Flower power-up. There is also a new power-up, which is a carrot that lets Mario slide across certain areas. Like "Super Mario World", Mario now has the spin jump ability, which can be used to kill certain enemies quickly.

Taking place after his loss in "Super Mario Land 2", Wario makes a decision to go on a hunt to get himself enough money to get a castle of his own. During his hunt, he discovers many treasures as he fights Captain Syrup and her army, the Black Sugar Pirates. The gameplay in Wario Land differs slightly from the previous Super Mario Land installments. For example, if the player holds down the B button, then Wario does not run. His momentum does increase, however, if Wario is using the Jet Wario power-up, which lets him fly through the air for a short amount of time at super speed. His other power-ups are Bull Wario, which gives him super strength and the power to stick to ceilings and conveyor belts, and the Dragon Wario power-up, which lets him blow fire. Wario is also able to hold and cast enemies (as well as coins, which are normally needed to go out of a stage).

VB Mario Land

This was a "Super Mario Land" game planned for the Virtual Boy which ended up called off because of the short time the system was out. The game was going to use all of the powers of the system and would have dungeons much the same to "The Legend of Zelda" games. Not much is known about this game, but it is known Wario was set to show up, as would a three-dimensional (also called 3-D) Mario Bros.. It is thought that some ideas were taken from this game and put into "Mario Clash".

Langston University

Langston University is an university in Langston, Oklahoma, USA. It is the only historically black college in the state. It is the westernmost historically black college in the United States. Though in a rural setting just 10 miles east of Guthrie, Langston also serves an urban mission with University Centers in both Tulsa and Oklahoma City.

The school was started in 1897. The school was first known as the Oklahoma Colored Agricultural and Normal University. Langston University was created because of the second Morrill Act in 1890. The law made states with land grant colleges (such as Oklahoma State University, then Oklahoma A&M) to either allow African-Americans in as students, or provide an alternative school for them to attend. This was required in order to receive federal money. Langston University is named for John Mercer Langston (1829-1897). He was a civil rights pioneer. He was the first African American member of Congress from Virginia. Langston started the Howard University Law School. He also served as American consul-general to Haiti.

Poet Melvin B. Tolson taught at Langston from 1947 until 1964. Tolson was portrayed by Denzel Washington in the film "The Great Debaters".

The University offers associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in a variety of disciplines. It is known as a leader in the field of agricultural research. It hosts the internationally known E (Kika) de la Garza Institute for Goat Research. The School currently has an open doors admissions policy.

The university was accredited with a Doctorate of Physical Therapy program in 2005.

The student life at Langston University got the attention of BET and the second season of the reality television show College Hill was filmed there. The Langston University Quiz Bowl team won games against Spelman and an all-star team from the City Colleges of Chicago on the 2009 nationally televised "Black College Quiz" show airing nationally throughout Black History Month in 2009 to make the championship game.


Marques Haynes

Marques Haynes (March 10, 1926 – May 22, 2015) was an American professional basketball player. He was a member of the Harlem Globetrotters. He is known for his ability to dribble the ball and keep it away from defenders. According to the movie "Harlem Globetrotters: Six Decades of Magic", Haynes could dribble the ball as many as six times a second.

Haynes learned to dribble the basketball from his sisters. His skills may have been helped by handling the ball on the dirt courts of his hometown. A native of Sand Springs, Oklahoma, he played basketball for Langston University from 1942-1946. While at Langston, he once dribbled out the clock in a conference tournament game to taunt an opponent, Southern University. Southern had just run up the score against a weaker team (Sam Huston College, later Huston-Tillotson University). The Sam Huston team was coached by a young Jackie Robinson. Haynes' own coach, the famous Zip Gayles, punished him for the taunting, but it helped draw the attention of the Globetrotters. They were always on the search for trick ballhandlers. Langston was invited to play an exhibition game against the Globetrotters in Oklahoma City. In that game, Haynes led Langston to a 4-point win. He was immediately invited to join the Globetrotters. He returned to Langston to complete his degree. Then he began his long professional career.

Haynes played with the Globetrotters from 1947-1953. Upon leaving in 1953, he turned down a $35,000 a year offer from the Philadelphia Warriors that would have made him the second-highest paid player in the NBA. Instead, he started his own barnstorming team, the Harlem Magicians. Boxing legend Sugar Ray Robinson sometimes played games with this team. Haynes later rejoined the Globetrotters as a player/coach. He also played for the Harlem Wizards.

He retired in 1992 after a 46-year professional career, and was inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame on October 2 1998. He lived in Dallas, Texas. Haynes died on May 22, 2015, in Plano, Texas, aged 89.

Many consider him the top ballhandler who ever lived. His game influenced players such as Bob Cousy, Pete Maravich, and Fred "Curly" Neal. It is possible that Haynes has played more professional basketball games than anyone in history, staying active well into his sixties.

Southwestern Athletic Conference

The Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) is a college athletic conference based in Birmingham, Alabama. It is made up of historically black universities in the Southern United States. It participates in the NCAA's Division I for most sports. In football, it participates in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). 

The SWAC is one of two conferences (the other being the Ivy League) which do not take part in postseason play in the FCS football tournament. It is the only one of the two whose members offer a full range of scholarships for football. The SWAC instead splits its schools into two divisions, and plays a conference championship game. Furthermore, one SWAC game, the Bayou Classic between Southern and Grambling State, is positioned on the schedule after the NCAA tournament has begun. In addition, Alabama State plays Division II rival Tuskegee annually on Thanksgiving Day (The Turkey Day Classic). 

In 1920, athletic officials from six Texas HBCUs – C.H. Fuller of Bishop College, Red Randolph and C.H. Patterson of Paul Quinn College, E.G. Evans, H.J. Evans and H.J. Starns of Prairie View A&M, D.C. Fuller of Texas College and G. Whitte Jordan of Wiley College – met in Houston, Texas, to discuss common interests. At this meeting, they agreed to form a new league, the SWAC.

Paul Quinn became the first of the original members to leave the league when it did so in 1929. When Langston University of Oklahoma was allowed into the conference two years later, it began the migration of state-supported institutions into the SWAC. Southern University entered the league in 1934. Arkansas AM&N entered in 1936 and Texas Southern University in 1954. 

As the state-supported schools became bigger, it became difficult for the church-supported schools to pay for their sports teams. Soon the church-supported schools started to leave the conference. Bishop withdrew from the conference in 1956, Langston in 1957 and Huston-Tillotson (formerly Samuel Huston) in 1959. That happened one year after two more state-supported schools entered the league (Grambling College and Jackson State College). The enter-exit cycle continued in 1961 when Texas College withdrew, followed by the entrance of Alcorn A&M in 1962. Wiley left in 1968, the same year Mississippi Valley State College entered. Arkansas AM&N exited in 1970 and Alabama State University entered in 1982. Arkansas-Pine Bluff (formerly Arkansas AM&N) rejoined the SWAC on July 1, 1997, regaining full-member status one year later. Alabama A&M University became the conference’s tenth member when it became a full member in September, 1999 after a one year period as an affiliate SWAC member.

Current championship competition offered by the SWAC includes competition for men in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, indoor track, outdoor track & field and tennis. Women’s competition is offered in the sports of basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, indoor track, outdoor track & field, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.

There are currently 10 members in the SWAC.


All games at were played at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.


Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award

The Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) is a Major League Baseball (MLB) award given each year to one outstanding player in the American and National Leagues. Since 1931, it has been awarded by the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA). The winner receives the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award. The award is named in honor of the first MLB commissioner. Landis served from 1920 to 1944. MVP voting takes place before the postseason. The results are not announced until after the World Series. The BBWAA began asking three writers in each league city in 1938. They made that number two per league city in 1961.

First basemen, with 34 winners, have won the most MVPs among infielders. This is followed by second basemen (16), third basemen (15), and shortstops (15). Of the twenty-four pitchers who have won the award, fifteen are right-handed while nine are left-handed. Walter Johnson, Carl Hubbell, and Hal Newhouser are the only pitchers to win more than once. Newhouser won his in back-to-back seasons, 1944 and 1945. Stan Musial, Alex Rodriguez, and Robin Yount have won at different positions. Rodriguez is the only player to win the award with two different teams at two different positions. Barry Bonds has won the most often (seven times). He has also won it the most times in a row (2001–2004). Jimmie Foxx was the first player to win more than once. Nine players have won three times and 19 have won twice.

The award's only tie occurred in the National League in 1979 when Keith Hernandez and Willie Stargell received the same amount of points. There have been 17 unanimous winners, meaning they received all the first-place votes. The New York Yankees have the most winning players with 22. The St. Louis Cardinals have the second most with 17 winners. Five teams have not had a winner. The most recent winners are Aaron Judge in the American League and Paul Goldschmidt in the National League.

Before the 1910 season, Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Automobile announced he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average in Major League Baseball at the end of the season. The 1910 race for best average in the American League was between the Detroit Tigers' widely disliked Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians. On the last day of the season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits against the St. Louis Browns. American League President Ban Johnson said a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway. Chalmers ended up giving cars to both players.

The following season, Chalmers created the Chalmers Award. A committee of baseball writers were to come together after the season to determine the "most important and useful player to the club and to the league". Since the award was not as useful at advertising as Chalmers had hoped, it was discontinued after 1914.

In 1922 the American League created a new award to honor "the baseball player who is of the greatest all-around service to his club". Winners, voted on by a committee of eight baseball writers chaired by James Crusinberry, received a bronze medal and a cash prize. Voters were required to select one player from each team. Player-managers and prior award winners were could not win. These problems resulted in the award's being dropped after 1928. The National League award, without these restrictions, lasted from 1924 to 1929.

The BBWAA first awarded the modern MVP after the 1931 season, took the format the National League used to distribute its league award. One writer in each city with a team filled out a ten-place ballot. Ten points were given for the recipient of a first-place vote, nine for a second-place vote, and so on. In 1938, the BBWAA raised the amount of voters to three per city and gave 14 points for a first-place vote. The only significant change since then happened in 1961, when the number of voters was lowered to two per league city.


Silver medal

A silver medal is a medal given to the second place finisher of contests (usually sports competitions) such as the Olympic Games or Commonwealth Games. First and third place finishers usually receive a gold medal and bronze medal, respectively.

In 1896, winners' medals were made from silver. The custom of gold-silver-bronze for the first three places dates from the 1904 games. It has been copied for many other sports events. Creating the medals is the responsibility of the host city. From 1928-1968 the design was always the same. One side showed a design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli with text giving the host city. The other side showed another design of an Olympic champion. From 1972-2000, Cassioli's design (or a slight reworking) remained on the one with a custom design by the host city on the other. Because Cassioli's design showed a Roman amphitheatre for what was originally a Greek games, a new design was create for the Athens 2004 Games. Winter Olympics medals have been of more varied design.

In The Open Championship golf tournament, the Silver Medal is an award given to the lowest scoring amateur player at the tournament.


Cáhuil

Cáhuil is a Chilean village. It is 15 kilometers south of Pichilemu, in the outfall of the Nilahue lake, in the Region of O'Higgins. "" means in Mapudungun language "seagulls place". The main characteristic of the place is the crafty production of "coastal salt", oysters and choros. The Cáhuil Lagoon is a place suitable for fishing, swimming and boat travels.

The salines in this area are very old. It is known that the indigenous people extracted it in a very rudimentary way. However, the extracting method has been improved and the production has increased. As of 1978, more than a 60% of the people of Cáhuil lived around the salt production, production not related to industrial enterprises.

In a way to promote the tourism in Cáhuil, the Municipality of Pichilemu created the "Salt Route", that takes the tourists into places where the salt generation process is dpne. This travel starts in Pichilemu and includes Cáhuil, Barrancas, La Villa, El Bronce, La Palmilla and La Plaza. On this route are two rural ranches, "Oro Blanco" and "El Bronce".

In the Cáhuil zone are at least 46 birds species. Many of the species are in danger of extinction. Some of them are the coscoroba swan, larus maculipennis, garza cuca, among others. It hosts at least seven silvester ducks species.


Liceo Agustín Ross Edwards

Agustín Ross High School, Liceo Agustín Ross Edwards or just L.A.R.E. is a Chilean public high school located in the coastal town of Pichilemu. It is named after Agustín Ross Edwards, a Chilean politician and known by his works in the city.

Derivative (mathematics)

In mathematics (particularly in differential calculus), the derivative is a way to show instantaneous rate of change: that is, the amount by which a function is changing at one given point. For functions that act on the real numbers, it is the slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph. The derivative is often written as formula_1 ("dy over dx" or "dy upon dx", meaning the difference in y divided by the difference in x). The "d" is not a variable, and therefore cannot be cancelled out. Another common notation is formula_2—the derivative of function formula_3 at point formula_4, usually read as "formula_3 prime of formula_4".

The derivative of y with respect to x is defined as the change in y over the change in x, as the distance between formula_7 and formula_8 becomes infinitely small (infinitesimal). In mathematical terms,
That is, as the distance between the two x points (h) becomes closer to zero, the slope of the line between them comes closer to resembling a tangent line.

Derivatives of linear functions (functions of the form formula_10 with no quadratic or higher terms) are constant. That is, the derivative in one spot on the graph will remain the same on another.

When the dependent variable formula_11 directly takes formula_4's value (formula_13), the slope of the line is 1 in all places, so formula_14 regardless of where the position is.

When formula_11 modifies formula_4's number by adding or subtracting a constant value, the slope is still 1, because the change in formula_4 and formula_11 do not change if the graph is shifted up or down. That is, the slope is still 1 throughout the entire graph and its derivative is also 1.

Power functions (in the form of formula_19) behave differently from linear functions, because their exponent and slope vary.

Power functions, in general, follow the rule that formula_20. That is, if we give "a" the number 6, then formula_21

Another example, which is less obvious, is the function formula_22. This is essentially the same, because 1/x can be simplified to use exponents:

In addition, roots can be changed to use fractional exponents, where their derivative can be found:

An exponential function is of the form formula_28, where formula_29 and formula_30 are constants and formula_31 is a function of formula_4. The difference between an exponential and a polynomial is that in a polynomial formula_4 is raised to some power, whereas in an exponential formula_34 is in the power.

Find formula_36.

formula_39

formula_40

Therefore,

formula_41

The derivative of logarithms is the reciprocal:
Take, for example, formula_43. This can be reduced to (by the properties of logarithms):
The logarithm of 5 is a constant, so its derivative is 0. The derivative of formula_45 is formula_46. So,
For derivatives of logarithms not in base "e", such as formula_48, this can be reduced to:

The cosine function is the derivative of the sine function, while the derivative of cosine is negative sine (provided that x is measured in radians):
formula_53.

Derivatives can be broken up into smaller parts where they are manageable (as they have only one of the above function characteristics). For example, formula_56 can be broken up as:

A function's derivative can be used to search for the maxima and minima of the function, by searching for places where its slope is zero.

Derivatives are used in Newton's method, which helps one find the zeros (roots) of a function..One can also use derivatives to determine the concavity of a function, and whether the function is increasing or decreasing.



Ruminant

A ruminant is an ungulate that eats and digests plant-based food such as grass. 

Ruminating mammals include cattle, goats, sheep, giraffes, bison, yaks, water buffalo, deer, camels, alpacas, llamas, wildebeest, antelope, pronghorn, and nilgai. All of them are Artiodactyla, cloven-hoofed animals. 

The word "ruminant" comes from the Latin word "ruminare" which means "to chew over again". They have a more complex digestive system than other vegetarians. Digestion of food is always done mainly by microorganisms, and in ruminants it is digested twice.

An example of a grass-eater which is "not" a ruminant is the horse. Horse excrement leaves the work of digestion half-done. This is very obvious to see in comparison to that of a ruminant.

Rumination works by chewing and swallowing in the normal way to begin with, and then regurgitating the semi-digested cud to re-chew it and to get the most food value out of it.

Rumination makes the half-digested food particles smaller, before they can go through the process of digestion.

The primary difference between a ruminant and non-ruminants (such as people, horses, and pigs) is that ruminants have a four-compartment stomach. 

The four parts of the stomach are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material. Solids clump together to form the cud or bolus. 

The cud is then regurgitated (brought up to the mouth) and chewed slowly. Fiber, especially cellulose, is broken down by microbial gut flora (bacteria, archaea, protozoa, and fungi).

Even though the rumen and reticulum have different names, they are the same functional space, as the digesta (food material) can move back and forth between them. 

The digesta then passes into the next chamber, the omasum, where water and many of the mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream. 

After this the digesta is moved to the true stomach, the abomasum. Digestion takes place here. 

The digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed. Water is absorbed in the large intestine, leaving the waste.

Almost all the glucose produced by breaking down cellulose is used by microbes in the rumen, and so ruminants get little glucose from the small intestine. Instead, glucose for a ruminants' brain function and lactation, if needed, is made by the liver.

There are 3.5 billion domestic ruminants, with about 95% being cattle, goats and sheep.

There are also about 75 million wild ruminants. They can be found anywhere except for the continents Australia and Antarctica. Most of them are in Europe, Africa and Asia.

Bible version debate

The Bible is a collection of texts. The original of these texts were written in different languages. Today, the collection of texts that is called "The Bible" is written in one language only. For this reason, at least some texts need to be translated. Versions of the Bible are also different in the texts they include, some texts are not part of some Bible versions. One of the first such translations is the Septuagint, which is Ancient Greek. Another well-known translation is the Vulgate, which is Latin. From about the 14th century, the Bible was also translated into other languages.

Translating a text is also always linked to looking at its meaning, and to interpreting it. A word in one language cannot be translated into a word in a different language, with exactly the same meaning. 
One such method of translation is called "literal translation" or "formal equivalence". Literal translation tries to be as close as possible to what is written in the original language. Often this means translating each word separately. There are a number of problems with literal translations: First, words must be added, to get a valid grammar in the target language. These words are not in the source text. The second problem is that the reader must be familiar with the subject, to understand some of the translation.

Another way is to look at the thoughts and ideas of the source text and to get these into the target language. This is called "dynamic equivalence". A translation that uses dynamic equivalence may use other words and phrases, but tries to keep the meaning intact.

A third way is called "paraphrasing". It tries to explain the concepts that are found in the text, and does not even use dynamic equivalence. That way, paraphrasing may leave out sections of text, or add other sections that explain these concepts. A paraphrased text may be very easy to understand, but is not suited for in-depth study.

Another problem that can occur with translation is that the meaning of some words may not be known. This is often the case with words that only occur once in a text. Such words are known as Hapax legomena. Their meaning must be guessed from the context.

Before the invention of the printing press, texts had to be copied by hand. This introduced errors. After a certain time there were different versions of the same text. Comparing such versions is known as textual criticism. The translation of two different versions of the same text may result in two different texts.

Some translators also translate the names, others simply write the name as it occurs in the original.


1955 World Series

The 1955 World Series was played between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees. The Dodgers won the Series in seven games. This was their first championship in team history. It would be the only Series the Dodgers won in Brooklyn. The team moved to Los Angeles after the 1957 season. The last time the Brooklyn team won a World Championship was in 1900. The team was called the Brooklyn Superbas. The series was called the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup. Their opponent then was fellow National League competitor Pittsburgh Pirates.

This series would also end a long period of success for the Yankees in the World Series. It was the Yankees' first loss in a World Series since 1942. It was only their second loss since 1926. The Yankees were 15-2 in the series during that time. They would lose again in 1957, 1960, 1963, and 1964. The Yankees would have a record of 4-5 in World Series over the next decade.

The two teams were meeting in a World Series for the fifth time in nine years. The Yankees had won in 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1953.

Second baseman

Second base, or "2B", is the second of four places on a baseball field which must be touched in order by a base runner before he can score a run for that player's team. A second baseman is the baseball player who guards second base. Also called "second bagger", the second baseman often has quick hands and feet. He needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly. He must be able to make the turn on a double play. Also, shortstops and second basemen are usually right-handed. This makes it easier to turn a double play. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4.

Current second basemen include Chase Utley, Robinson Cano, Dustin Pedroia, Orlando Hudson, Aaron Hill and Ben Zobrist.

The following second basemen have been elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum:
<nowiki>*</nowiki> Later played at first base<br>

Naoki Matsuda

Matsuda was born in Kiryu on March 14, 1977. After graduating from Maebashi Ikuei High School, he joined Yokohama Marinos (later "Yokohama F. Marinos") in 1995. From first season, he became a regular player and played as right back of three defense with Japan national team players Masami Ihara and Norio Omura. The club won the champions in 1995 J1 League. In 2000s, he mainly played as center back with Yuji Nakazawa or Yuzo Kurihara, also played defensive midfielder. The club won the champions in 2001 J.League Cup, 2003 and 2004 J1 League. Although he played as central player of Marinos in 16 seasons, he was sacked end of 2010 season.

In August 1993, Matsuda was selected the Japan U-17 national team for 1993 U-17 World Championship. He played full-time in all 4 matches and scored 1 goal. In April 1995, he was also selected the Japan U-20 national team for 1995 World Youth Championship and he played full-time in all 4 matches.

In July 1996, Matsuda was selected the Japan U-23 national team for 1996 Summer Olympics and he played full-time in all 3 matches. Although Japan won 2 matches, Japan lost at First round. At this time, Japan won Brazil in first game. It was known as "Miracle of Miami" () in Japan.

On 5 February 2000, Matsuda debuted for the Japan national team against Mexico. After the debut, he played many matches as one of three backs defense. In September, he was selected U-23 Japan for 2000 Summer Olympics 2nd time. However he played only 2 matches instead Koji Nakata got injured in the third game.

In October 2000, Matsuda was selected Japan for 2000 Asian Cup. He played 3 matches and Japan won the champions. In 2001, he was also selected Japan for 2001 Confederations Cup. He played 4 matches and Japan won the 2nd place. At 2002 World Cup, he played full-time in all 4 matches. After 2002 World Cup, he did not play in many matches. He was selected Japan for 2004 Asian Cup. Although Japan won the champions, he played only 5 minutes. On 29 January 2005, he played and scored a goal against Kazakhstan. Although this goal is his first goal for Japan, this game became his last game for Japan. He played 40 games and scored 1 goal for Japan until 2005.

In 2011, Matsuda moved to Japan Football League club Matsumoto Yamaga FC. Although he played for qualify for promote to J2 League, in August 2, he collapsed for myocardial infarction during training. On August 4, he died at the age of 34. His last match against Honda on July 23 was his400th game in the league. At the end of the season, the club won promotion to the J2 League.

During practice on August 2, 2011, he collapsed from a heatstroke and a heart attack. He was rushed to hospital. He was put on life support, but died from "sudden cardiac failure" on August 4.

Nick Griffin

Nicholas John "Nick" Griffin (born 1 March 1959 in Barnet, Hertfordshire, England) is a British politician who served as the chairman of the British National Party (BNP), from 1999 to 2014, and Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the region of North West England, between 2009 and 2014.

Nick Griffin was educated in Suffolk, and joined the National Front when he was 14. He became a political worker for the party after his graduation from Cambridge University. In 1980 he became a member of its governing body, and later wrote articles for several right-wing magazines. In 1995, he joined the British National Party and in 1999 he became its leader. He made several attempts to make the party electable including the removal of certain extremist policies. At the 2009 European Parliament election, Griffin was elected an MEP for the North West England region. In October 2009, he was on the BBC television show "Question Time" which caused controversy.

In March 2017, Nick stated that he would want to emigrate to Hungary. He said,

“And I hope that Hungary, the Hungarian government, the Hungarian people, will welcome people who are genuine refugees from western Europe but keep out the liberals who have brought western Europe to this state in the first place.”

In May 2017, he was issued with a entry and residence ban from the Hungarian government, declaring him as the persona non grata.


Geoffrey Burbidge

Geoffrey Burbidge (born Chipping Norton, 24 September 1925; died La Jolla, California, 26 January 2010) was an English astrophysicist. For many years he was professor at the University of California, San Diego. In 1957 he published a famous paper, together with three other physicists, about the origin of elements. Many scientists disagreed with ideas that he had later in his life, because he did not believe in the Big Bang theory.

He started to study history at the University of Bristol, but soon changed to physics because he could then get financial help from the government (World War II was on, so science was very important to the government). He went to London and got a doctorate from University College London in 1951. He met the astronomer Margaret Peachey. He became very interested in astronomy and he married her in 1948. From then on they always worked together in several places. They worked at Harvard, the University of Chicago and Cambridge University. Then Margaret got work at the California Institute of Technology, while Geoffrey worked at the Mount Wilson Observatory and Palomar Observatory. They both got jobs at the University of California, San Diego, in 1962.

In 1957 he and his wife, together with William Fowler, the American physicist, and Fred Hoyle, the British astronomer, wrote a 104-page paper about stellar nucleosynthesis. The paper became known as the B2FH (because of their initials). It talked about nuclear reactions inside stars, showing how these reactions tear apart blocks of matter and put it together again differently. It was a similar idea to what Charles Darwin had written about 100 years earlier in the “Origin of Species”, where he had described how creatures had evolved. Scientists saw this paper as the most important paper ever written about astrophysics.

Later in his career Burbidge refused to accept the Big Bang theory which describes the start of the universe. Quasars are very bright objects with a very high redshift. The Big Bang theorists say that they come from places extremely far away in the universe. But Burbidge thought that quasars come from nearby galaxies, travelling near the speed of light, which explains their redshift. He thought they produced new matter as old matter was destroyed by reactions.

Although many scientists disagree with Burbidge’s later ideas, he is still thought of as an extremely important scientist. He was given many honours. In 2005 he and his wife were awarded the British Royal Astronomical Society Gold Medal.

Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is the use of radiation to treat diseases. It is typically used to treat of cancer. It may use a radioactive material or particle accelerator or other source of ionizing radiation that can kill or damage cancerous cells.

Radiation therapy may help cure several different types of cancer if they are limited to one area of the body. Doctors also use it to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy works together with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in cancers known to be affected by radiation.

Radiation therapy is used on tumors because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of exposed tissue thus killing it. To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through in order to treat the tumor), doctors aim weaker radiation beams from several angles of exposure. The beams intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. 

Besides the tumor itself, the target for the radiation may also include the lymph nodes that drain the area. Doctors include the lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of that individual cancer cells will spread. It is impossible to aim the radiation beam exactly because the tumor moves as the patient breathes. So, doctors also expect to include some healthy tissue around the tumor to make sure that the entire tumor is hit by radiation.

Radiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation. This is different than radiology, the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis). Radiation may be prescribed by a radiation oncologist with intent to cure ("curative"). It may also be used as palliative treatment (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and it can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, Immunotherapy or some mixture of the four. 

Most common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way. The precise treatment intent will depend on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radiation source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure of healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs.

Radiation therapy can also be used in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. Doctors limit the use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions because they worry about the radiation could start new cancers. 


Dacarbazine

Dacarbizine is a type of drug used to fight cancer. It works by changing DNA, which makes cancer cells grow more slowly or completely stop growing. It is used against metastatic melanoma. Only about 15.3% of people who use the drug respond to it. People who use this drug do not live any longer as a result.

It has side effects, including less blood cells, damage to the liver. I can also sometimes make other types of cancer start growing.

Ross Hotel

The Ross Park is an old hotel in the Chilean city of Pichilemu. It was created by Agustín Ross Edwards in 1885, and remodeled in December 1987.

The park is located on Agustín Ross Avenue, in front of the old Ross Casino. The hotel was originally named "Great Hotel Pichilemu" (). The once grand Ross Hotel was constructed at the same time. Although the hotel, one of the oldest in Chile, is still partially open to guests, it is in a high state of disrepair.

The hotel was named National Monuments on February 25, 1988.

Liceo Santa Cruz

Santa Cruz High School (Liceo Santa Cruz) is a public high school in Santa Cruz, Chile.

On August 2, 1963 the Men's High School of Santa Cruz was created. Adriano Díaz donated land where the high school was going to be constructed. However, a sport complex was constructed there instead.

The high school opened on March 1, 1964 in an old house. It had at least 170 students. Many of these students already had finished their first or second grade in "Humanities" in the Pedro Aguirre Cerda High School, but it was not recognized officially.

The first principal was Osvaldo Castillo, who hired teachers. Almost all of the teachers had worked in the Pedro Aguirre High School. 

A logo and a standard were designed. Both included palm trees, which were common in the city. The anthem of the high school was composed by Raúl Benavides.

Chronic myeloid leukemia

Chronic myeloid leukemia is a chronic (slowly progressive) form of leukemia. It can be treated with Gleevec (Imatinib). Other treatments that are sometimes used include Interferon. Hydroxyurea has also been used, as has Busulfan. 

Zoom (1972 TV series)

Zoom (stylized as ZOOM) is a January 1972-February 1978 and January 1999-May 2005 television series on PBS Kids.


Haboob

A haboob is a storm that forms in the downdrafts of a thunderstorm. The downdrafts are caused by air being pushed down onto the ground, similiar to a leaf blower. They can be seen in deserts like the Saharan and in places like Arizona.

A thunderstorm can make strong downdrafts, which is just wind that blows down towards the surface of the Earth. When the wind hits the Earth, it starts to move sideways and picks up dirt and dust. It makes a cloud of dust that is bad for people, animals and plants.


Food waste

Food waste is food that is thrown away, either because it is not needed or wanted, or because it must be thrown away by law.

Large amounts of food waste can occur at any stage in the process of producing food. In subsistence agriculture, the amounts of food waste are unknown. Very likely, very little food is wasted, because food is produced because of a need for food. In the developed world, the food industry produces food for a global marketplace demand.

Research has been done to see where food waste occurred. The researchers looked at the food industry of the United States and found that food was wasted at the beginning of the food production. From planting, crops can be subjected to pest infestations and bad weather, which cause losses before harvest. Natural forces such as temperature and rainfall are the main influences on the growth of crops. For this reason, all forms of outdoor agriculture is subject to losses because of these influences. The use of machinery in harvesting can cause waste, because harvesters may not see the difference between ripe and immature crops, or collect only part of a crop. Food is also wasted because it does not meet certain standards or regulations for quality and appearance As a result, certain crops that do not meet these standards are not harvested; left in the field, they can provide fertilizer, or food for animals.

It is unknown how much food waste occurs during food processing. When food is stored, considerable amounts are wasted because of pests and microorganisms. This problem occurs in countries where it is both relatively hot, and humid. These conditions boost the growth of pests and microorganisms. Extreme temperature, humidity, or microoganisms also influence the nutritional value, caloric value and edibility of crops and account for food waste. The "qualitative losses" are more difficult to assess than quantitative ones. More losses occur because the food is not handled correctly, or because it loses weight or volume.

It is difficult to reduce some of the food waste produced by processing without affecting the quality of the product. Certain regulations concerning the safety of foods cause food to be wasted, before it even reaches the market. Safety regulations are in place to protect the health of the consumer. They are very important, especially where foodstuffs of animal origin are processed. Contaminated products from these sources can lead to and are associated with microbiological and chemical hazards.

Preventing health issues is more important than preventing food waste, or the reuse of foods that do not meet the standards.,

Computer Misuse Act 1990

The Computer Misuse Act 1990 (c. 18) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It was made after Robert Schifreen and Stephen Gold hacked into British Telecom's Prestel viewdata service in 1984-1985. They were even able to see personal messages of Prince Philip, but they could not be prosecuted as there were no laws against hacking. This was a problem, as people could hack into systems and see personal data without breaking the law, which was why the Computer Misuse Act was made.

Some people did not like the act, saying it was made too quickly and not given much thought. The act did not make a difference between people who hacked for fun from people who hacked to steal data or money. Other countries have made their acts for hacking using parts of the Computer Misuse Act, such as Canada and the Republic of Ireland. It has been amended many times since 1990 to keep it up to date.

Pine Gap

Pine Gap is a United States Intelligence gathering facility in Australia. It is southwest of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory.

In the late 1960s, a treaty was signed between the United States and Australia to establish a joint intelligence facility to monitor and track Soviet missile capabilities. Whilst most activities are highly classified, it is widely known that, more recently, Pine Gap controls which are used to monitor world affairs for the US, as well as controlling systems, , air-warfare, battlefield intelligence, , and drone warfare. There is a question regarding the need for US involvement in this facility as Australia has a fully capable computer and intelligence infrastructure and other allied states run similar facilities without US interference.

Conspiracies exist which link the site to covert programs for monitoring and testing of laser weaponry for satellite and space based attack/defence and secret control of UFOs. This possibly indicates the testing of secret projects for the US who have their own deserts for such.

Pine Gap employs about 800 American intelligence, security military personnel. from The station is partly run by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), US National Security Agency (NSA), and US National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and is a key contributor to the NSA's global interception/surveillance effort, which included the ECHELON program. It is responsible for about 2,000 people in the Alice Springs region who are US citizens. The US influence in the area is evident by American sports such as baseball and American football. Similarly, the celebration of American festivals which are normally not active in Australia, such as Halloween, Independence Day and Thanksgiving also showcase the US lack of integration into Australian Outback society. 

This area is subject to a native title claim from the Central Aboriginal Land Council.

Placozoa

The Placozoa are an animal phylum, a primitive form of invertebrate. They are the simplest in structure of all metazoa.

The Placozoa is usually considered to have only one species, Trichoplax adhaerens, but there is enough genetic diversity that it is possible that there are multiple, morphologically similar species.

Although they were first discovered in 1883, a common name does not exist for the taxon. The scientific name literally means "flat animals".

"Trichoplax" is a small, flattened, animal around a millimetre across. Like an Amoeba, it has no regular outline, although the upper surface is always flattened. The body consists of an outer layer of simple epithelium enclosing a loose sheet of cells. The epithelial cells bear flagella, which the animal uses to help it creep along the seafloor. Between these layers is the fiber syncytium, a liquid-filled cavity strutted open by star-like fibers.

"Trichoplax" feed by absorbing food particles—mainly microbes—with their underside. They generally reproduce asexually, by dividing or budding, but can also reproduce sexually. Though "Trichoplax" has a small genome in comparison to other animals, nearly 87% of its 11,514 protein-coding genes are similar to known genes in other animals.

In the 1960s and 1970s renewed interest among researchers led to the discovery that the animals people had been studying are adults, not larvae. This newfound interest also included study of the organism in nature (as opposed to aquariums).

Combining greek ""Plakoeis"" and ""Zoea"" makes the ethymological origin of "Placozoa".

Sipuncula

The Sipuncula, also known as the Sipunculida, or peanut worms, are a small phylum of marine worms, or they may be a class in the Annelida. The phylum has 144–320 species (estimates vary) of these bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented worms.

Sipunculans are worm-like animals ranging from in length, with most species being under . The body consists of a narrow front section, called the "introvert" and a larger trunk section. The introvert is retractable into the trunk.

Sipunculans have a coelom (body cavity), and a body wall somewhat similar to that of annelids. The body wall is strong and muscular. When threatened, Sipunculids can retract their body into a shape resembling a peanut kernel – a practice that has given rise to the name "peanut worm".

The most recognizable part of Sipunculan worms is their mouth, which is surrounded by a mass of 18–24 ciliated tentacles, all of which may be inverted into the body. The tentacles are used to gather organic detritus from the water or substrate, and probably also function as gills. The mouth and tentacles lie at the tip of the introvert, which is otherwise decorated with numerous spines or nodules. In contrast, the trunk tends to be relatively smooth.

Table (information)

A table of information is a set of facts arranged in rows and columns. It is a way of displaying information. It requires a medium, such as writing or print on paper, or a computer monitor. It is both a mode of visual communication and also a way to set out data. 

A table consists of an orderly arrangement of rows and columns. The columns and rows usually have names or labels. Tables may include notes, headers, footers or other features. Like other graphic forms such as diagrams and illustrations, tables are often used together with prose. In books and articles, tables are often given numbers and captions. 

Tables were the first way to print social and scientific data, before any other kind of graphics like graphs and charts. All the information about a modern society was recorded and published first as tables. Marriage certificates were written tables. Census results were recorded as tables, and later analysed in printed tables. All weather observations were published as printed numerical tables. Many kinds of reports to Parliament contained tables of data. Many of these methods were invented in Britain, because the government collected statistics about the population, and then published the results.

The use of tables is widespread in all types of communication, research and data analysis. Tables appear in print media, handwritten notes, computer software, architectural ornamentation, traffic signs and many other places. The details vary according to circumstances. Tables are extremely flexible, and can easily be constructed on computer and in print.
Tables are not always easy to understand, and there is a whole industry which takes table information and turns it into other forms, such as graphs and charts, for the benefit of the reader.


Siphon (mollusc)

A siphon is a long tube-like structure that is present in certain aquatic molluscs: Gastropods, bivalves, and cephalopods. The tube is used for the exchange of liquids, or air. This flow can have different purposes, the most common are breathing, locomotion, feeding and reproduction.

The siphon is part of the mantle of the mollusc, and the water flow is directed to (or from) the mantle cavity.

A single siphon occurs in some gastropods. In those bivalves which have siphons, they are paired. In cephalopods, there is a single siphon or funnel which is known as a hyponome.

Catherine Spence

Catherine Helen Spence (31 October 1825 – 3 April 1910) was a Scottish-Australian journalist and author in Australia. She fought for the rights of poor people, orphans, criminals, women, and children. She devoted most of her life to making change in South Australia. She strongly believed that women should be allowed to vote. Spence believed that everyone should get a good education. She was the first Australian woman to try to join the government.

She was lovingly called "the Grand Old Woman of Australia". In Scotland a plaque was made at her birthplace in 1999 (89 years after she died). She died in Adelaide, South Australia.

Catherine Helen Spence was born in 1825 in Melrose, Scotland. She moved to South Australia with her family in 1839. She went to a small private school and got a good education. Spence started working as a private teacher when she was 17 years old. She became good at giving public speeches and preaching.

Catherine Helen Spence was an activist for many humans' rights. She made many public speeches on the subjects she thought were important. She wrote several books. She did not sign with her own name on the first few books she wrote. Her first book was about Australia. It was the first book about Australia created by a woman. She created a program that helped the poor and children without families. Spence was important to an organization that supported women’s right to vote. South Australia (the place she lived) became the first place to let women vote.

Spence wrote about wanting equality in the government and fairness towards women. She wanted women to be paid as much as men. She also wanted the environments that women worked in to be safe and healthy. Most people were not ready to accept her ideas in South Australia.

2002 Commonwealth Games

The 2002 Commonwealth Games were held in Manchester, England from 25 July to 4 August 2002. The XVII Commonwealth Games was the second-largest multi-sport event ever to be held in England after the 2012 Summer Olympics. It was larger than London's 1948 Summer Olympics in numbers of teams and events (but not athletes) in the event.

After the 1996 Manchester bombing, the Games were part of the development of Manchester. It helped Manchester's reputation as a European Global City, and also, internationally. Rapid Economy of Manchester economic growth and continued urban rebuilding of the city continued after the Games. This helped make it one of the main cities in the United Kingdom.

Events were held across Greater Manchester. The opening and closing ceremonies, the athletic and the rugby sevens events were held at the City of Manchester Stadium. It was built for the Games. The shooting events were held in the National Shooting Centre in Bisley, Surrey. This was some from the main focus of the Games in Manchester. This is unusual for a large multi-sport event.

Seventy-two nations competed in 14 individual sports and 3 team sports events.

Desso GrassMaster

Desso GrassMaster is a sports playing field surface made of natural grass that has artificial fibres added to it. The unique part of this system is the artificial grass fibres, stuck 20 cm deep, which cover 3% of the surface. During the growing process, the roots of the natural grass mix with the man-made grass fibres to anchor the turf to product a stable, solid, and even field with better drainage and better playing comfort.

Reinforced natural grass is used for stadium pitches and training pitches used for soccer, rugby, American football and baseball. Reinforced natural grass can also be used for events and concerts. The artificial turf injection shortens the recovery time for the grass. Reinforced Natural Grass (also known as Hybrid Grass), as the name suggest, is formed by the mixture of natural and artificial fibres. It was in the year 1990, when the first generation of Reinforced Natural Grass developed. Using turf, made up of synthetic fibres, combined with Natural Grass has become extremely popular in recent times. In this case, the artificial fibres are intertwined with natural grass roots as they grow. The synthetic fibers help to stabilize and protect the natural grass, improving growth of natural grass fields.

In 2010, for the first time in history, a FIFA World Cup was played on grass pitches that were partly made up of artificial grass in the Mbombela Stadium and the Peter Mokaba Stadium.


Table (furniture)

A table is a piece of furniture with a flat top supported by one or more legs. People put things on a table, often for a short time, for example food and knives and forks, etc. at a meal, cups for drinks, a book, a map, writing paper when writing, and things for hobbies.

We also put things on tables for a longer time, for example a TV, computer or decorations (pretty things). Often we put a cloth on the table, flat on the top. There are traditional ways of putting the cloth, knives and forks and food on the table for meals.

We can make some tables bigger, for example by pulling the top out. We can also fold some tables to transport them better, for example for camping. There are also small tables in trains and planes which we can fold or open. Some round tables come with a Lazy Susan. This is a rotating piece of wood in the center of the table. A table for use outdoors is called a picnic table.

Traditionally, tables in Japan, "chabudai", are low, sometimes round tables, for tea and food.

The name of the international organization Mensa is from the Latin word for table.

Manatee Palms Youth Services

Manatee Palms Youth Services is a hospital. It has 60 patients at its location in Bradenton, Florida. Manatee Palms Youth Services has been shut down by the State of Florida twice because of hurtful behavior from staff workers and nurses at its hospital. Florida will not let Manatee Palms admit any more patients because of this hurtful behavior. The State of Florida has found Manatee Palms a hospital that doesn't take care of its patients.

The first time abuse at Manatee Palms that is on public record happened in November 1991 when a staff worker sexually hurt a teenage patient. Another situation occurred in February 1994 when Mark Duane Brewer, a hospital counselor, had sex with a 16-year-old patient in the hospital. Another family filed suit against the same man in May of 1994, alleging their children were also raped. Another situation happened in 1996, when a staff member attacked a patient by putting him in a choke hold and throwing him to the ground. In 1997, an 18 year old man raped a patient at Manatee Palms.

In October 2004, a sexual assault happened at the facility and the staff member admitted it.

In November 2004, four patients ran away from the hospital, stole a car, caused crashes, and almost hit a sheriff's deputy. In February 2009, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of a former patient who was physically assaulted by staff on a daily basis.

Manatee Palms was in the news after people found out that a sex offender was employed in 2003. The 41-year-old asked a 15-year-old girl to engage in sexual acts with him and record it with a video camera.

In April 2007, Manatee Palms was closed by the State of Florida for hiring staff members with criminal records, staff abusing patients, buildings falling apart, and threatening some people in Florida.

Japanese food

Japanese food includes the many different styles of cooking in Japan. Every region in Japan has its own tradition about cooking. Foods eaten in Japan also reflect the history of the cultural exchange between Japan and other culture. Since the modern times, the influence of the West inspired Japanese culinary tradition to invent new dishes, some of which have become popular not only inside Japan but also outside. However, most of the culinary traditions of Japan commonly think that seasonality is important. 

Soya beans are a very important ingredient in Japanese cooking; it is used in soya sauce, natto, miso and tofu. Soya milk is also used as a drink. One example of a dish with soya beans in it, is tofu. Tofu is made from pressing soybeans into cubes and then boiling them. Tofu is often in soups and stews. Deep fried tofu is also used in many popular Japanese dishes, for example as kitsune udon and inari sushi.

Noodles (like in most Asian foods) are used often in Japanese foods. The dishes usually come originally from China; nevertheless they have reached a unique development in Japan.

Japan is surrounded by the ocean so there is a rich variety of seafood which is an important part of Japanese cooking.
Japanese people did not eat meat until the Europeans first came. Fish was the most common food. 

Wasabi is Japanese horseradish. It is often a green paste used with sashimi and sushi. Wasabi is also used with many other Japanese foods. 
Wasabi is sold as a paste or in powder form. Wasabi powder has to be mixed with water to be turned into a paste. Wasabi has a strong, very spicy (hot) taste.
Sashimi is very thinly cut raw seafood. Many different kinds of fresh fish and other seafood are served raw in Japanese dishes. Sashimi is one of them. It is almost the same as sushi, but it has no vinegar rice. When the slices of fish are put on small pieces of rice they are called "Nigiri Sushi".
Sashimi is artistically arranged and put on the plate on top of shredded daikon and shiso leaves. The fish pieces are dipped into soya sauce before being eaten.
Seaweed has been a very important part of Japanese dishes for a long time. Today, many different types of seaweed are used in soups, seasonings and other forms of Japanese cooking. These are the three seaweeds used the most:

Tofu is a popular traditional dish in Japanese and has become popular in Asia and the rest of the world.


Pointe du Hoc

Pointe du Hoc is a place in the Normandy in northern France. It has steep cliffs about 100 m high that drop down toward the sea and a very thin beach at the bottom that is underwater at high tide and dry at low tide. It was important during World War II.

In 1944, Pointe du Hoc was part of Operation Overlord, which was the biggest sea invasion in history. During World War II, the Allied military commanders planned how to attack France, which had been captured by the German Wehrmacht. The Germans had put very large guns at Pointe du Hoc. There were six 155mm cannons in concrete forts that could shoot at Allied ships and troops that wanted to come on land at Utah Beach and Omaha Beach. 

Allied planes, flying from England, dropped bombs on Pointe du Hoc. But they did not break the heavy artillery guns, and the Germans moved them away. 

For about five months, the U.S. Rangers trained with British commandos to prepare for their attack on France. They practiced climbing British cliffs. 

Once the Allied commanders decided to attack France, they used flat-bottomed landing craft made to carry troops onto beaches. These special landing boats were called LCA and LCVP's or Higgins boats. British navy sailors sailed them. The boats were lowered into the sea a few kilometers away from the cliffs. The British had added some extra armour to the sides of the boats to protect them. This made it harder for the boats to move fast and turn.
The American 2nd and 5th Army Ranger Divisions attacked the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc. Colonel James Earl Rudder led the attack. The attack started at 6:30 a.m of D-Day, when the battleship USS Texas stopped shooting at Pointe du Hoc. Because the weather was bad, the Rangers' boats drifted in the water and they took an extra half hour to get to the beach. By then, the Germans had come out of their forts and were ready at the top of the cliff.

The American landing boats reached the beach, and the Army Rangers ran up the beach to the cliffs. The soldiers used ropes attached to rocket-powered grappling hooks to climb the cliffs. Two soldiers carried the ropes and grappling hooks in a wooden box. The soldiers also used ladders that were attached to landing boats and grappling hooks that were shot up from the boats.

When the Rangers reached the top of the cliffs, small groups of soldiers attacked the Germans. After reaching the forts, where they thought the Germans kept their guns, the Rangers found that the guns were no longer there. The Rangers went inland and searched for the guns and found them. They used thermite fire grenades to melt important parts of the guns. 

Out of 225 soldiers only 90 were still able to fight when reinforcements came.

French toast

French toast is a breakfast food made by soaking bread in eggs. 

Milk, sugar or cinnamon are commonly added. The dish is often topped with powdered sugar, butter, fruit, syrup, or other items. According to what is popular in local cuisine, many of the spices that are added to bread or egg dishes are in cooking. 

In the United Kingdom, it is sometimes known as "Eggy Bread". It is a Christmas time dessert in Portugal and Brazil called rabanada. And is an Easter dessert in Spain called torrijas.

John Smith (explorer)

John Smith (c. January 1580 – 21 June 1631) was a English soldier, explorer, and author. Smith was a leader of the first settlements at the Virginia Colony in 1608-1609. He explored the rivers of Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay and drew a map of the Chesapeake Bay area and New England.

Smith's books and maps were very important in supporting Englishmen living in the New World. He wrote, "Here every man may be master and owner of his own labour and land and if he has nothing but his hands, he may still grow rich."

At Jamestown Smith trained the people to farm and work so they would have food to eat. He told them "he who shall not work, shall not eat." Smith's strength of character and his determination overcame many problems including the harsh weather, lack of water, living in a wilderness, with people who did not want to work, and attacks from the Powhatan people.

Smith was born in January 1580 at Willoughby, Lincolnshire where his parents rented a farm. He claimed descent from the ancient Smith family of Cuerdley.

Smith left home at the age of 16 and went to sea. He served as a soldier in the army of Henry IV of France against the Spaniards, fought for Dutch revolt from the Spanish King Philip II of Spain. He went to the Mediterranean Sea where he worked in both trade and piracy. He then fought against the Ottoman Empire in the Ottoman wars and for the Austrian Habsburgs in Kingdom of Hungary in 1600 and 1601.

Smith is reputed to have defeated, killed and beheaded Turkish commanders in 3 duels. He was knighted by the Transylvanian Prince and was given a horse and coat of arms showing 3 Turks' heads. In 1602 he was wounded in a skirmish, captured and sold as a slave. Smith wrote that his Turkish master sent him as a gift to his Greek mistress in Constantinople, who fell in love with Smith. He then escaped from the Ottoman lands and returned to England in 1604.

In 1606 the Smith was hired by the Virginia Company to settle in Virginia Colony for profit. They set sail in three ships, in December 1606. Smith had a servant named Samuel Collier. Samuel Collier would stay by him most of the way through. 

There were problems on the voyage and Smith was charged with mutiny. Captain Newport planned to execute him. The Captain opened a letter of orders from the Virginia Company which stated that Smith was to be one of the leaders of the new colony, so Smith was not killed.

The English arrived in April 1607 and Captain Wingfield chose Jamestown to be the location for the colony. In summer the settlers were still living in temporary housing. After the four-month ocean trip, food supplies were only enough for each person to have a cup or two of grain-meal per day. Due to the weather and lack of food disease spread through the people and by September, more than half died.

In December 1607, Smith was looking for food and was captured by Native Americans. He was taken to meet the Chief of the Powhatan tribe. The village was about 15 miles from Jamestown. Smith was released without harm and gave credit in part to the chief's daughter, Pocahontas, who threw herself across his body. Seeing this, her father took mercy on Smith and he was safely taken back to Jamestown. This encounter began a friendly relationship between the natives, Smith and the colonists at Jamestown.
In early January 1608, nearly 100 new settlers arrived with Captain Newport, and through carelessness the village was set on fire. That winter the James River froze over, and the settlers were forced to live in the ruins. During this time, Newport and his crew wasted much time loading their ships with iron pyrite (fool's gold). Food supplies ran low and although the Native Americans brought some food, Smith wrote that “more than half of us died.” 
In April 1608 a ship brought supplies and 50 new settlers, whom Smith set to build housing and to plant crops.

In the summer of 1608, Smith left Jamestown to explore the Chesapeake Bay region and search for badly needed food. He made a map that would be of great value to Virginia explorers for over a century. In his absence, Smith left his friend Matthew Scrivener, as governor in his place. Scrivener would later drown in a storm in an ill-fated voyage to Hog Island. Smith was elected president of the local council in September 1608 and instituted strict rules.
In October 1608, a ship arrived with 70 new settlers, including the first women. Some German and Polish craftsmen also arrived, but they brought no food supplies. After that, Smith tried to get food from the Native Americans and it took threats of military force for them to obey. Powhatan was frightened by the great number of white men coming into the area and was trying to starve them.

Smith found that there were those among both the settlers and Native Americans who did not like his rules and were planning to kill him. Smith wrote that he was warned by Pocahontas. He called a meeting and told the men who did not work that “he that will not work shall not eat…” After that the situation improved.
For three months in early 1609, February, March and April all was well at Jamestown with many dwellings built, acres of land cleared and much other work done. Then in April, rats and dampness destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent a large group of settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Indians and ordered everyone to work or they would have to leave the safety of the fort. Some left and went to the Native American villages, but Powhatan’s people also went by Smith’s law that he who works not, eats not. This was in effect until they were near starved and they returned home.

At some point an unexpected ship arrived, captained by Samuel Argall. He had food and wine which Smith bought with a promise to pay back. Argall also brought news that the Virginia Company was sending more supplies and settlers to Jamestown along with a new governor, Lord De la Warr.

In a May 1609 voyage to Virginia, Sir Thomas Smith, Virginia Company treasurer, arranged for about 500 colonists, including women and children to come along. A fleet of nine ships set sail. One sank in a storm soon after leaving the harbor. The "Sea Venture" was shipwrecked on the Bermuda islands with the admiral and Stephen Hopkins on board. One year later, in May 1610, they had arrived at Jamestown in small boats they had made. Gates soon found that there was not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area, they met a ship carrying the new governor, Lord De la Warr, who ordered them back to Jamestown.

In August 1609 John Smith was quite surprised to see more than 300 new settlers arrive. London was sending new settlers with no planning as to how or where they would live.

Capt. John Smith was severely injured by an accidental gunpowder explosion in his canoe. Smith sailed to England for treatment in October 1609. He had spent two and a half years trying to do his best for Jamestown. He never returned to Virginia. History has confirmed his great contribution at Jamestown in its earliest years.

Colonists would continue to die from various illnesses and disease, with an estimated 150 of the 500 surviving that winter. In spite of this, the Virginia Company continued to finance and transport settlers to sustain Jamestown. For the next five years, Governors Gates and Sir Thomas Dale continued to keep strict discipline, with Sir Thomas Smith in London attempting to find skilled craftsmen and other settlers to send to Jamestown.

In 1614, Smith returned to the northeast coast of America and named the region "New England". In that same year a storm destroyed his ship. In 1615, Smith was captured by French pirates off the coast of the Azore Islands. He escaped after weeks of captivity and made his way back to England, where he wrote an account of his two voyages as "A Description of New England". He never left England again. He died in the year 1631 in London at the age of 51. He is buried in the church of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate in the City of London.

The Captain John Smith Monument currently lies off the coast of New Hampshire on Star Island, part of the Isles of Shoals. Built in 1864 to honor the 250th anniversary of John Smith's visit to what he named Smith's Isles.

In 1914, the New Hampshire Society of Colonial Wars partially restored and rededicated the monument for the 300th anniversary celebration of his historic visit. The monument had weathered so badly in the harsh coastal winters that the words carved in the granite had worn away.



Entoprocta

Entoprocta, or Kamptozoa, is a phylum of tiny sessile aquatic animals ranging from 0.1 to 7 millimetres (0.004 to 0.28 in) long. Mature individuals are goblet-shaped, on relatively long stalks. They are filter-feeders, with a crown of tentacles whose cilia generate water currents towards the mouth. Both the mouth and anus lie inside the crown. The superficially similar Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) have the anus outside a 'crown' of hollow tentacles. Most families of entoprocts are colonial, and all but 2 of the 150 species are marine. A few solitary species can move slowly.

Some species eject unfertilized ova into the water while others keep their ova in brood chambers until they hatch, and some of these species use placenta-like organs to nourish the developing eggs. After hatching, the larvae swim for a short time and then settle on a surface. There they metamorphose, and the larval gut generally rotates by up to 180°, so that the mouth and anus face upwards. Both colonial and solitary species also reproduce by cloning.

Some species of nudibranchs (sea slugs) and flatworms prey on entoprocts. A few entoproct species have been found living in close association with other animals. 

Fossils of entoprocts are very rare and the earliest specimens that have been identified with confidence date from the Upper Jurassic. Most studies from 1996 onwards have regarded entoprocts as members of the Trochozoa, which also includes molluscs and annelids. However, a study in 2008 concluded that entoprocts are closely related to bryozoans.

'Entoprocta' means 'anus inside'. The alternative name 'Kamptozoa', means 'bent' or 'curved' animals. Some authors use "Entoprocta", while others prefer "Kamptozoa".

5000 metres

The 5000 metres (about 3.1 mi or 16,404 ft) is a popular running distance. It is also known as a 5K or 5 km. Colloquially it is called a "five-K". It is one of the track events in the Olympic Games and the World Championships in Athletics. "5000 metres" refers to racing on a track. "5K" usually refers to a roadrace or cross country event. While mainly run as an outdoor event, the 5000 m is sometimes run on an indoor track. Official records are kept for both outdoor and indoor 5000 m track events, but not for 5 km road races.

Much of the distance's popularity is due to the challenge it gives to both amateurs and professionals. It is a distance race that demands a great deal of endurance as well as speed. Strategies also play a key role, and the combination makes it attractive to many.


Sportcity (sports ground)

Sportcity Manchester is a sports area in eastern Manchester. It became famous as the host of the 2002 Commonwealth Games. It hosts the regional base for the English Institute of Sport. It has athletics tracks, The National Squash Centre, The Regional Tennis Centre, the Manchester Velodrome and the City of Manchester Stadium. It was also the proposed location for the "SuperCasino" but the plan was rejected by the House of Lords.

Oakwell

Oakwell is a sports development in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England. It is used mostly by Barnsley Football Club for playing their home games. It is also used by their reserve team.

While the name "Oakwell" is usually used for the main stadium, it also includes several neighbouring venues which form the facilities of the Barnsley F.C. academy. This includes an indoor training pitch, a smaller stadium with seating on the south and west sides for around 2,200 spectators, and several training pitches used by the different Barnsley FC teams.

Until 2003 the stadium and the large amount of land that is around it was owned by Barnsley Football Club. However, after falling into administration in 2002 the council purchased the main Oakwell Stadium. This allowed the club to pay its creditors and remain participants in The Football League.

The West Stand is the only original part of Oakwell Stadium left standing, however it was made 'all-seater' in 1995.

The stand is made up of two tiers, only the upper tier is covered but at the expense of several supporting columns for the roof structure, the seats are the originals from the early 1900s, from here you get a decent view with moderate legroom. In spite of the restricted views and modest facilities, the West Stand remains a popular vantage point for many fans. The lower tier of the West Stand is uncovered and offers a great view of the action.

The roof of the West Stand is corrugated iron this also houses the main television gantry which is accessed from the upper level seating area by a temporary ladder.

At the end of the 1990s, the then-stadium owners Barnsley Football Club were considering re-developing the West Stand after several seasons of high attendances. However, with the rapid decline in fortunes of the football club, and sale of the stadium and new club ownership these plans are unlikely to happen in the near future.

The stand also has a traditional players tunnel in the centre. This is used for access to some of the facilities underneath the stand. The main players tunnel now comes out from the north-west corner following the moving of the changing rooms to the North Stand.

The West Stand has a total seating capacity of 4,752.

The East Stand is a two level development completed in 1993. Funded in part by the football trust, the stand has a capacity of 7,492 and replaced a large covered terrace known as the Brewery Stand. The East Stand was designed by NYP Architects,as was the North Stand and the Corner Stand. With the completion of the East Stand, Barnsley FC became the first football club in Yorkshire to add 'executive boxes' into their stadium. The East stand is very modern, and has plenty of legroom.

Due to the sloped land on which Oakwell Stadium is built, the rear of the East Stand is much taller than it is from the pitchside. This means a climb to the upper level seating area requires many more steps than a spectator may anticipate. However several lifts are available.

Built in 1995, CK Beckett is the current name for what is traditionally known as the 'Pontefract Road End' or 'Ponty End'. Some fans continue to call it the 'ORA Stand' - in reference to the original sponsors of it. Also, known as the Van Damme Stand.

With a capacity of 4,508, The CK Beckett Stand is a large covered single tier seating area behind the goal on the south side of the stadium.

This part of the stadium also houses the players gym, the club superstore, box office, and general administration offices.

It is understood that this stand had been designed specifically with future development in mind, therefore should the club ever have the need to increase the grounds capacity then it would be fundamentally possible to add a second tier without making any major alterations to the existing structure.

The North Stand is the most recent addition to Oakwell Stadium and is a large covered singled tiered seating area with a capacity for 6,000 spectators.

As this stand is generally reserved for away supporters its capacity is rarely utilized, although during the 2006/07 season, Sheffield Wednesday, Derby, Birmingham and Sunderland fans all filled the end, Sunderland also took up half of the West Stand. In the 2009/10 season, Newcastle United filled the stand.

At a cost of £4.5 million (including several academy facilities that it accommodates), it has been a cause for debate ever since its construction. However at the time it was built, Barnsley FC had only just been demoted from the FA Premier League and were planning for a possible return.

The Corner Stand was built in the summer of 1998. It was originally known as 'The Welcome Windows Stand'. It is an unusual three level structure. It provides further executive areas and disabled facilities for viewing an event.

Access to this area was also added into the neighbouring East Stand on several levels. The spectator capacity of the structure is 202.

In recent years Oakwell Stadium has rarely been used by anyone other than Barnsley FC. The occasional celebrity charity football match has been played there.

Wakefield Trinity Wildcats Rugby League Club used the stadium for their first game in the Super League (Europe) in 1998.

Non-league football club Wakefield and Emley used the stadium for an FA Cup tie against Rotherham in 1998, choosing a larger neutral venue as opposed to the traditional option of 'switching' the tie to the home of the team which was drawn away.

Premier League side Manchester City used the stadium for their first qualifying round UEFA Cup game in July 2008. This was because the pitch at the City of Manchester Stadium was not ready for football games after the summer's boxing and music concerts.

In March 2008, club secretary Don Rowing revealed that the West Stand would be demolished and rebuilt. Given that the average gate at Barnsley accounts for less than 50% of capacity this appeared to be a strange announcement, however there are a number of structural concerns with the roof and the wooden floor of the upper tier and it would seem that a new structure is more financially viable than maintaining the existing one.

No firm timescales or details of the structure have yet been released. Plans for a replacement stand were submitted to the local council several years ago, in this particular case the stand was to have around 9,000 seats - it remains to be seen whether such a large stand would be built. Given the current attendance figures then a new stand with around the same capacity as the existing West Stand would be more than viable.

On 27 December 1920, Horace Fairhurst, a young full-back for the visiting Blackpool, received a blow to the head during a league game. He died at home eleven days later as a result of the injury.

Ryszard Kaczorowski

Ryszard Kaczorowski (born 26 November 1919 in Białystok - died 10 April 2010 in Smolensk, near Katyn Forest) was a Polish politician and statesman. He was the last President of Poland within Government in Exile. It originated from early days of the World War II and was internationally recognized until 1945. 

Kaczorowski was active in Polish scouting movement, organized anti-Soviet resistance in 1939-1940. He was arrested, sentenced to death, which was commuted to 10 years of hard labour. He was then released in 1941. He joined Anders Army and fought in a battle of Monte Cassino. Kaczorowski decided to remain in exile in the United Kingdom after the establishment of the communist government. He worked for many years as economist, but never became a British citizen. He was active in emigree circles. He was the head of exiled Polish scouting for example.

After retirement, he became Minister of Home Affairs. In exile, he was named designated successor for President Kazimierz Sabbat. He succeeded the office on 19 July 1989 following Sabbat sudden death.

After the popular election of Lech Wałęsa for President of Poland in 1990, Kaczorowski handed presidential insignia of pre-War Poland to him. The Government in Exile ended its historical activity and recognized the new Third Republic of Poland.

Although he largely was not involved in partisan politics, Kaczorowski remained an active figure after his Presidency. He visited Poland frequently (as he lived permanently in London) and participated in many events.

In 1952 he married academic Karolina Kaczorowska. They were married until his death in 2010.

He died in a presidential plane crash with President Lech Kaczyński on 10 April 2010 in Russia. His body was buried in state in Warsaw's Belvedere Palace. His crypt was buried in the National Temple of Divine Providence in Warsaw.

Manchester City Council

Manchester City Council is the local government for Manchester. Manchester is a city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England. It is made up of 96 councillors. There are three for each of the 32 wards. Currently the council is controlled by the Labour Party. It is led by Sir Richard Leese. Much of the council and local civil service is located at Manchester Town Hall and the Town Hall Extension, in the city's commercial centre.

Manchester was incorporated in 1838 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 as the Corporation of Manchester or Manchester Corporation. It gained city status in 1853. It was only the second such grant since the Reformation. Under the Local Government Act 1972 the council was reconstituted as a metropolitan borough council in 1974. The area included in the city has been increased many times. In 1885 (Bradford, Harpurhey and Rusholme), 1890 (Blackley, Crumpsall, part of Droylsden, Kirkmanshulme, Moston, Newton Heath, Openshaw, and West Gorton), 1903 (Heaton), 1904 (Burnage, Chorlton cum Hardy, Didsbury, and Moss Side), 1909 (Gorton, and Levenshulme), 1931 (Wythenshawe: Baguley, Northenden, and Northern Etchells), and Ringway. A new Town Hall was opened in 1877 (by Alderman Abel Heywood) and the Mayor of Manchester was granted the title of Lord Mayor in 1893.

Elections are usually by thirds. A third of the seats elected, three years in every four. In the 2004 elections, due to a lot of boundary changes (which involved the total number of councillors reduced) all seats were contested.

The council has been controlled by the Labour Party since its reconstitution in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972.

"Gules, three bendlets enhanced Or; a chief argent, thereon on waves of the sea a ship under sail proper. On a wreath of colours, a terrestrial globe semée of bees volant, all proper. On the dexter side a heraldic antelope argent, attired, and chain reflexed over the back Or, and on the sinister side a lion guardant Or, murally crowned Gules; each charged on the shoulder with a rose of the last. Motto : Concilio et Labore" ".

The Shield : red (Gules) with three gold (Or) bands drawn diagonally across to the right hand side. The white (Argent) top segment (the Chief), shows a ship at sea in full sail. This is a reference to the city's trading base. Crest : On a multicoloured wreath stands a terrestrial globe, signifying Manchester's world trade, and covered by a swarm of flying bees. The bee was adopted in the 19th century as a symbol of industry—Manchester being the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution. Supporters : On the left a heraldic antelope with a chain attached to a gold (Or) collar, representing engineering industries, and hanging at the shoulder, the red rose of Lancashire, in which county Manchester once was. On the right a golden lion stands guardant (facing us), crowned with a red (Gules) castle (a reference to the Roman fort at Castlefield from which the city originated). The lion also wears the Lancashire Rose. Motto : "Concilio et Labore"--loosely translated "By wisdom and effort" (or 'By counsel and hard work').






Lord Don't Slow Me Down

Lord Don't Slow Me Down is a rockumentary movie. It looks back on British band Oasis' "Don't Believe the Truth" world tour. The tour took place from May 2005 to March 2006. The movie is directed by Baillie Walsh. It went platinum in the UK.

A handful of fans-only private screenings took place around the world. The world premiere of the movie at the Directors Guild Theater in New York City on 4 November 2006 as part of the CMJ Film Festival. The UK television premiere was on Channel 4 on 19 November, at 11:50PM. It was a heavily edited version with about 40 minutes cut from the original 95 minute version. The movie was first shown to go along with Oasis' compilation album "Stop the Clocks", released on 20 November 2006. A preview of the movie was included on the Let There Be Love DVD single, released in November 2005.

The movie features a new Oasis song also called "Lord Don't Slow Me Down", written by Noel Gallagher and recorded during the Don't Believe the Truth sessions. Gallagher described it as being ""one of the best things, like The Who, The Yardbirds and the Jeff Beck Group combined, and it's got two drum solos on it!"". He has also said that his girlfriend thought it was the only Oasis song you could dance to. The song was left off "Don't Believe the Truth" because Gallagher felt that including it would have meant he'd have been singing too many songs on the record. Italian footballer Alessandro Del Piero also appears in the video signing a shirt for Noel.

"Lord Don't Slow Me Down" was released on DVD on 29 October 2007. The DVD set contents:

The kea ("Nestor notabilis") is a large parrot. It lives in forests and high rocky hills on the South Island of New Zealand. It is mostly olive-green in color. It has a large, narrow, curved, grey-brown upper beak. The kea is the only parrot in the world that lives in alpine habitats.

Kea are intelligent and curious. People think this may help them survive in the mountains.

Kea likes playing with human objects. They like to tear the rubber off car windows and move around traffic cones.

New Zealand band Fatcat & Fishface wrote a song about Kea in their album "Birdbrain".

Velvet

Velvet is a type of woven tufted fabric in which the cut threads are very evenly distributed, with a short dense pile, giving it a distinctly smooth feel.

Velvet can be made from many different fibres. It is woven on a special loom that weaves two pieces of velvet at the same time. The two pieces are then cut apart and the two lengths of fabric are wound on separate take-up rolls. Velvet is difficult to clean due to its pile, but modern dry cleaning methods perform well.

Velvet is made, ideally, from silk. More recently, synthetic velvets have been developed, mostly polyester, nylon, viscose, acetate, and mixtures of different synthetics, or synthetics and natural fibers (e.g. viscose and silk). A small percentage of lycra is used sometimes to give stretch.

The art of velvet-weaving probably originated in medieval Kashmir around the beginning of the fourteenth century. King Richard II of England directed in his will that his body should be clothed "in velveto" in 1399.

The earliest sources of European artistic velvets were weavers in Lucca, Genoa, Florence and Venice.

Nemertea

Nemertea is a phylum of invertebrate animals also known as "ribbon worms" or "proboscis worms". Most of the 1,400 or so species are marine, with a few living in fresh water and a small number of terrestrial forms. They live in all marine habitats, and throughout the world's oceans. Alternative spellings for the phylum have included "Nemertini" and "Nemertinea". "Rhynchocoela" is a name used primarily in North America but gradually abandoned since the 1980s.

Nemertean worms are long, thin, animals without segments. They have no true head, although the anterior end is often slightly wider than the body. They are distinguished by the presence of an eversible proboscis. This is kept inside the body, but pushed out to catch prey.

Nemerteans collect food with their proboscis, which is closely associated with the digestive system. At rest, the proboscis is inside a long tube that may take up a considerable portion of the worm's length, lying just above the gut. It is attached to the posterior end of this tube by a muscle that pulls it back inside after feeding. At the anterior end, the tube opens into a small cavity close to the brain, and then to the outside through a pore at the anterior tip of the animal.

Nemerteans range in size from 5mm (0.2 in) to over 30 m (100 ft) long in the case of the European "Lineus longissimus", with most species being 20 cm (8 in) or less. There are reports of specimens up to 50 or 60m long, which would make it the longest animal in the world. The longest animal on record is a female blue whale, 29.9m long.

Speed reading

Speed reading is the name for a number of ways to increase the speed at which a text can be read, so that the important facts of the text can still be understood. There are different ways to improve reading speed, but they are all similar. A trained reader is able to read and understand between 200 and 300 words per minute, for a text that is not very difficult to understand. Better training can improve this speed to over 1000 words per minute. Using a lot of exercise, it is possible to increase reading speed further. The best readers can read between 3000 and 4000 words per minute, and understand about 80% of them.

In general, only a small part of the letters read are seen clearly. The brain guesses what the rest of the word is, based on a small part of the word. This also applies to groups of words, which are treated the same way. Known groups are handled faster, because the reader knows them, and also has an "image" for them. 

What is very important when reading text is the ability to recognize words and word groups. The reader will then add the known image to the context. A known font can help this. 

What is bad for speed reading is having a bad short-term memory. Another factor is a small vocabulary. People who only know few words, need more time to "scan" unknown words, simply because fewer words in the text are known.

Abu Dhabi United Group

The Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and Investment (ADUG) is a United Arab Emirates (UAE) private equity company owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. He is a member of the Abu Dhabi Royal Family. He is also the Minister of Presidential Affairs for the UAE. It was first thought that Abu Dhabi United Group is a part of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund owned by Abu Dhabi. But Abu Dhabi United Group had denied connection to the government of Abu Dhabi.

The Group bought Manchester City Football Club. The deal was announced on 1 September 2008. It was made between the club’s former owner Thaksin Shinawatra, former Prime Minister of Thailand, and ADUG.

The American educated Sulaiman Al-Fahim was the public face of ADUG during the beginning of the takeover. He is often called the "Donald Trump of Abu Dhabi". The takeover was completed on 23 September 2008.

Maine Road

Maine Road was a large football stadium in Moss Side, Manchester, England. It was home to Manchester City F.C. from when it was built in 1923 until 2003. It takes its name from the street it was built on which also had a remarkable history. The street was first known as Dog Kennel Lane. It formed part of an ancient route south of Manchester.

When first opened, the stadium was the largest club ground in England and the second largest in the country after Wembley Stadium. Maine Road's record attendance was set in 1934, when 84,569 people attended an FA Cup tie between Manchester City and Stoke City. It is the record for an English club ground (the 1923 FA Cup Final holds the world record). The following February the stadium recorded the highest Football League attendance. This stood at 79,491 for a game against Arsenal. The record has since been beaten for the League, but it is still Manchester City's largest League crowd. The design of the ground changed several times over its 80-year history. Before it closed, Maine Road was an all-seater stadium, with a capacity of 35,150.

The 2002-03 season was Manchester City's last at Maine Road. The last match was played on 11 May 2003. The following season Manchester City moved to City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester. Maine Road was torn down in 2004.

Plans to build Maine Road were first announced in May 1922. It came after a decision by Manchester City F.C. to leave their Hyde Road ground. Hyde Road did not have room for expansion and had been damaged by fire in 1920. Two sites in Belle Vue, East Manchester were suggested, but neither was considered good enough. To many City fans east Manchester was thought of as City's home. Many were disappointed when a site in south Manchester was chosen. A City director, John Ayrton, resigned from the Board later in the decade and helped to form an alternative MCFC, Manchester Central F.C., playing at Belle Vue.

A sixteen and a quarter acre former brickworking on Maine Road was purchased for £5,500. Maine Road had first been known as Dog Kennel Lane. It was renamed Maine Road during the 1870s because of pressure from the Temperance Movement.

Stadium construction began late in 1922. Plans by architect Charles Swain proposed a 120,000 capacity ground based on the design of Hampden Park. These plans were reduced to give a capacity of 80,000. However, this figure was still the second largest in the country, behind Wembley Stadium, leading to a label of "The Wembley of the North". Wembley had opened in London only a few months earlier. This made a source of rivalry between the northern and southern divisions of builders Sir Robert McAlpine, who built both stadia. During construction, the stadium was supposedly cursed by a gypsy when Manchester City officials evicted a gypsy camp from the area. This curse was allegedly removed on 28 December 1998. However, the gypsy curse is likely to be an urban myth, as such stories are endemic to a number of football league grounds. Construction took 300 days. The total cost £100,000. The first layout of the ground was one covered stand with a seating capacity of 10,000. It had uncovered terracing on the other three sides, with gentle curves connecting the corners.

The first match at Maine Road took place on 25 August 1923, and saw 58,159 fans watch the home side beat Sheffield United 2-1.

The first changes to the ground took place in 1931, when the corner between the Main Stand and the Platt Lane end at the south of the ground was rebuilt to incorporate a roof. The highest attendance at an English football game of any type at a club ground was at Maine Road on the March 3, 1934, when Manchester City played Stoke City in front of 84,569 fans in the 6th round of the FA Cup. Changes at the Platt Lane end took place in 1935, extending the terracing and providing a roof for the full stand. This marked the peak capacity of the ground, estimated at around 88,000. Further changes were planned, but were suspended when Manchester City were relegated from Division One in 1938, and abandoned when World War II broke out. 

The stadium was shared by Manchester United for a period after the Second World War, since Manchester United's Old Trafford ground had been partially destroyed during the Manchester Blitz. United paid City £5,000 per season, plus a share of gate receipts. The highest attendance for a League game at Maine Road occurred during this period, when 83,260 people watched Manchester United play Arsenal on January 17, 1948. This figure is a national record for a League game.

Floodlights were installed in 1953, and in 1957, prompted by the hosting of two FA Cup semi-finals in successive years, the side facing the Main Stand (which until that time was generally known as the "Popular Side") was redeveloped and named "The Kippax Stand" after a nearby street. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, the Kippax became the part of the ground where the club's most vociferous fans congregated. In 1963, benches were installed at the Platt Lane end, meaning that Maine Road had more seats than any other English club ground of the time. The next major redevelopment came in the 1970s, with the construction of the North Stand, a cantilevered stand which remained in place until the closure of Maine Road. The 1980s saw ambitious plans for improvements: however, these plans were shelved due to financial pressures after the Main Stand roof had been replaced at a cost of £1 million.
By 1990, some areas of the ground looked antiquated, and the Platt Lane stand was demolished in 1992. Its place was taken by the all-seater "Umbro Stand" that also incorporated executive boxes, and was opened in March 1993. The stand was renamed back to the "Platt Lane Stand" in the late 1990s.

The era of standing accommodation at Maine Road came to an end in May 1994 as the stadium became all-seater to comply with the requirements of the Taylor Report with the demolition of the "Kippax Street Terrace". The final match where standing was permitted took place on 30 April 1994, Chelsea the visitors for a 2–2 draw. Immediately prior to demolition the capacity of the Kippax terrace was 18,300. A three-tier stand was built in its place, holding nearly 14,000 spectators, and on its completion in October 1995 it was the tallest stand in the country.

The new stand was an impressive modern facility, but it also emphasised the haphazard nature in which the ground had been redeveloped, as all four sides were of differing heights and construction styles. There were further plans for expansion which would have taken the stadium's capacity to 45,000, but these were put on hold following City's relegation from the Premier League in 1996.

There were plans for further expansion at Maine Road to take the capacity to 45,000 all-seated, but these were abandoned in favour of a move to the City of Manchester Stadium that was being constructed for the Commonwealth Games in 2002.

The final competitive match before the closure of the stadium took place on 11 May 2003. Manchester City ended the Maine Road era with a 1-0 defeat to Southampton, with Michael Svensson scoring the stadium's last goal. The final match was followed by short performances by musical acts Badly Drawn Boy and Doves.

City's final goal at the stadium was scored on 26 April 2003 by Marc-Vivien Foe, who died on 26 June that year from an undetected heart condition while representing the Cameroon national football team.

Toward the end of Maine Road's lifespan there were proposals for other sports teams to make use of the stadium following City's relocation; Stockport County once expressed interest in moving there from Edgeley Park, and in December 2000 Sale Sharks rugby union club was offered a lease for the stadium. However, none of the proposals came to fruition.

An auction of the ground's fixtures and fittings took place in July 2003, raising £100,000, which was donated to community projects in the Moss Side area, which was undergoing a lengthy regeneration process. Demolition began in late 2003, taking seven months. Two years later the go-ahead was given for a new housing development to take part on the site, consisting of 474 homes.

For long periods of its history Maine Road had the widest pitch in England. However, the width was changed several times by managers wishing to alter the pitch size to suit their style of play. In the final season before the ground was closed, the pitch size was 107 x 71 metres (116.5 x 78 yards).

Maine Road hosted two England internationals, the first was a 3-0 defeat of Wales on November 13, 1946 and the second a 9-2 win over Northern Ireland on November 16, 1949, England's first ever World Cup qualifier. In addition, A number of wartime internationals were held at the ground. Maine Road was also the venue for a number of rugby league matches, hosting the rugby league championship final eleven times between 1938 and 1956.

The stadium was used for several scenes in the 1948 motion picture "Cup-tie Honeymoon". More recently, it was featured in the 2000 film "There's Only One Jimmy Grimble" and the 2003 ITV drama "The Second Coming", which starred Christopher Eccleston.

Maine Road has also played host to a number of rock concerts, including The Rolling Stones, Simple Minds, Queen, Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd, Bryan Adams, Jean Michel Jarre, Dire Straits, David Bowie & Guns N' Roses.

In 1974, teen idol David Cassidy played the stadium.

The most high profile concert held at Maine Road was that of Mancunian band Oasis (themselves avowed Manchester City fans) in April 1996, a performance which was later released as a video, "Oasis:...There and Then".

Prince also played the stadium twice in the early 1990s.

Maine Road also gives its name to a non-league football club, Maine Road F.C.. The club, who currently play in the North West Counties Football League Division One, was founded by a group of Manchester City supporters in 1955. The club previously based its headquarters at the social club adjoining Maine Road.

Notes

John D. Rockefeller

John Davison Rockefeller (July 8, 1839 – May 23, 1937) was an American businessman. He controlled an oil company called Standard Oil, which sold most of the oil in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was the first billionaire in world history. He is considered to be the richest man in American history, and one of the richest men in the history of the world.

Today, the money he made would be worth more than half a trillion dollars. He used the large amounts of money he had to do various things, including starting the University of Chicago, funding important medical research, and giving the land for the General Assembly Building of the United Nations.

Rockefeller was born in Richford, New York. He died in Ormond Beach, Florida from arteriosclerosis, aged 97.

2008 UEFA Cup Final

The 2008 UEFA Cup Final was the 37th final of the UEFA Cup. It is UEFA's second-tier club football tournament. The match was played at the City of Manchester Stadium. It is the home stadium of Manchester City F.C., in Manchester, England, at 20:45 CEST (19:45 local time) on 14 May 2008.

The match was played by Zenit St. Petersburg of Russia and Rangers of Scotland. It was called a battle of Rangers coaching staff, with ex-boss Dick Advocaat, currently the manager of Zenit against current boss Walter Smith. Smith has had two times as manager of Rangers. Both coaches led the Rangers to the Scottish domestic treble; Smith in 1993 and Advocaat in 1999.

Zenit won the match 2–0. They had goals from Igor Denisov and Konstantin Zyryanov. It was their first UEFA Cup title. It made them only the second Russian side to win the competition, after CSKA Moscow in 2004–05.

The logo of the final shows a picture of the City of Manchester Stadium, created by English artist Liam Spencer. It was first shown at a ceremony in the stadium on December 6.

Zenit and Michel Platini asked the British government to ease visa procedures for Russian fans, despite Russia having cancelled visas for British fans travelling to 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow. However, the Director for British Visa Services for the CIS, Mandy Ivemy, said that "for the U.K. government, visas and biometric checks are a vital part of immigration policy, and we are not prepared to waive them".

Meanwhile, there was a mass flow of Rangers fans into Manchester. Over a hundred thousand supporters 'invaded' the city despite the club's official ticket allocation being just 13,000 and police requests for fans to stay at home. The influx of people resulted in there being no vacant hotel rooms in a twenty-mile radius of the city and the total amount of money that was ploughed into the local economy was estimated to be around £25 million.

Rangers' home ground, Ibrox, was opened to show a live beamback of the match to approximately 30,000 spectators. Fans queued overnight for a seat in the stadium. The capacity was reached more than two hours before kick-off.

Zenit St. Petersburg were without the competition's top scorer, Pavel Pogrebnyak, who had picked up two bookings in the knockout stages of the tournament and was therefore suspended. However, they were able to call upon their other star names such as attacking midfielders Andrei Arshavin and Konstantin Zyryanov, as well as holding midfielder Anatoliy Tymoschuk.

Rangers manager Walter Smith started with Jean-Claude Darcheville on his own up-front, with a five-man midfield supporting him comprising Steven Davis, Kevin Thomson, Steven Whittaker, Barry Ferguson and Brahim Hemdani. Neil Alexander was making only his tenth start in goal for Rangers, first choice keeper Allan McGregor was injured.


The event was marred by fans rioting in Manchester city centre; these riots started after a big screen that was due to show the match had failed. BBC News 24 interrupted normal programming to broadcast the riots live on television. ITN's flagship News at Ten programme gave a lot of coverage to the riots.

A Zenit fan was also attacked and stabbed. Six Rangers fans were arrested on suspicion of grevious bodily harm.

UEFA stadium categories

UEFA stadium categories are categories for football stadiums laid out in the UEFA Stadium Infrastructure Regulations. Using these regulations, stadiums are rated as category one, two, three, or elite (in order going up). These categories replaced the old method of ranking stadiums as four or five star in 2006. A stadium must be categorised as elite to host the final of the UEFA Champions League or the UEFA Europa League. These are UEFA's two top club competitions.

The Futureheads

The Futureheads are a four-piece English, punk band from Sunderland. Their name comes from the title of The Flaming Lips album, "Hit to Death in the Future Head".

The band met at City of Sunderland College as a quartet consisting of Barry Hyde (vocals and guitar), David "Jaff" Craig (bass), Peter Brewis (drums), and Ross Millard (vocals and guitar). Millard and Craig had been in another local band together before. They used the Sunderland City Detached Youth Project building (where Brewis and Hyde worked) as a free practice space. The project was meant to get young people off the streets by using music. They first performed in 2000. The reputation in the area grew through word-of-mouth. Hyde's younger brother Dave replaced Brewis (who went on to form Field Music).

In an interview with Channel 4's "4Music", Barry Hyde said that Dave Hyde was given a golden guitar by his parents when he was young. But Barry had taken it off him to learn to strum his first chords. Dave was left with nothing, forcing him to take up the drums.

The Futureheads played their first gig at Ashbrooke Cricket and Rugby Club in December, 2000. They debuted with their "Nul Book Standard" EP and then their "123 Nul EP" on March 10, 2003. Later that year they released their first single, "First Day," on August 4.

The Futureheads released their self-titled debut album in September, 2004 on 679 recordings. Five tracks of the tracks were produced by Andy Gill of Gang of Four. The rest of the album was produced by Paul Epworth. The song "Decent Days And Nights" from the album was featured in the video game soundtrack to "" on PlayStation 2 and Xbox as well as EA's "Rugby 2005".

On February 21, 2005, "Hounds of Love", a cover of a Kate Bush song, was released as a single. It reached number eight in the UK Singles Chart in its first week. It was named Best Single of 2005 by "NME". The band toured the United States. They later supported the Pixies, Foo Fighters and Snow Patrol.

They performed at BBC Radio One's One Big Weekend, held in their home town of Sunderland over the weekend of May 7-8, 2005. On May 8, 2005 Sunderland A.F.C. picked up the Coca-Cola Championship trophy. In tribute, the Futureheads performed a set live at the Stadium of Light as pre-match entertainment.

The stand-alone EP, "Area" was released in November, 2005 while the band was working on their second album "News and Tributes". According to "NME" in February, 2006, it took only five weeks to make. The first single from the album was "Skip to the End" released on May 15. The album "News and Tributes" was first released on May 29, 2006.

The band became bothered by major label music business and being under contract were very lucky to be set free by 679 Recordings. Hyde said "we were desperate to get out of the record deal, they could easily have kept us and made us try and make more records but we didn't want that'

Throughout the rest of 2006, The Futureheads started their own independent record label, Nul Records, and started working on songs for their next album.

In June, 2007, they reportedly completed work on their third album, "This Is Not the World," which was released in May, 2008. Millard said that he expected the new album to be punkier than the last album. He also said that the band was close to splitting during the time after the second album was released. 

The band made a free download called "Broke Up The Time" available from their website on November 9, 2007. They also announced three gigs in the UK followed by a full UK tour. They now have their own label, Nul Records, set up exclusively to distribute Futureheads material. In December, 2007 the band released a video of them walking around Carnaby Street, London to the single "The Beginning of the Twist." It was also accompanied by a free download of a song called "Crash."

The second single from their album "Radio Heart" was released on May 19, 2008 from their album "This Is Not The World" followed by the release of the music video for the single on April 16. A third single from the album, "Walking Backwards," was released on August 4, 2008.

Dicynodont

The Dicynodontia are extinct animals called therapsids. 
They were herbivorous (plant-eating) animals with two tusks; 'dicynodont' means 'two dog tooth'. 
They were the most successful and diverse of the non-mammalian therapsids, with over 70 genera (types) known.

All of them had the same basic body plan. They were built like small tanks, with sturdy legs at each corner. They were not fast movers, but were obviously strong and lived in groups as many plant-eaters do today. Their body shape was similar to certain types of modern mammals such as pigs and rhinoceros. 

Fossils discovered in Poland show that dicynodonts survived at least until about 200 million years ago (the Upper Triassic period. Six fragments of fossil skull bone discovered in Australia (Queensland) may indicate that dicynodonts survived much longer, until about 150 million years ago (the Cretaceous period) in the region called the southern Gondwana.

The dicynodonts were a group of therapsids, but were not ancestors to the mammals. The group which evolved into mammals was the cynodonts.

2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations

The second Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament (known as the Gillette Tri-Nations due to sponsorship) was played between 16 October and 27 November of 2004. The format of the competition was different from the previous event. In that event the teams played each other twice instead of once before the final.

The tournament final of the tournament was predicted by some to be a close affair. The British team was considered a small favourite after finishing at the top of the league table. Instead, it was a one-sided match as Australia produced their best performance of the tournament. The game was basically over by half-time when Australia led by 38-0.

During the series, Australia and New Zealand played additional Tests against France.
A one off match was also played between an ANZAC side made up of touring Australian and New Zealand players and a Cumbira side.

Gneiss

Gneiss is a type of metamorphic rock. The minerals in gneiss may come from rocks which were originally either igneous or sedimentary. They were heated and squeezed, and the minerals recrystallized.

Orthogneiss is gneiss got from igneous rock (such as granite). Paragneiss is gneiss got from sedimentary rock (such as sandstone).

In gneisses, minerals tend to be foliated: layered and segregated into bands. Thus there are seams of quartz and of mica in a mica schist, very thin, but consisting essentially of one mineral.

The Lewisian complex or Lewisian Gneiss is a suite of Precambrian metamorphic rocks that outcrop in the northwestern part of Scotland, forming part of the Hebridean Terrane. These rocks are of Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic age, ranging from 3.0–1.7 Ga.

Román Fresnedo Siri

Román Fresnedo Siri (February 4, 1903 – June 26, 1975) was a Uruguayan architect. He was born in Salto and died in Montevideo.

An international competition to choose the most original design had been won in 1961 by a Uruguayan architect, Mr. Roman Fresnedo Siri. Siri had won acclaim for designing major civic buildings hroughout South America, including offices and hospitals. He also had a passion for the ocean, and even used his talents to design racing yachts. 

Siri’s spirit and originality did not disappoint. From its earliest days, architects and passersby alike were intrigued by surprises in the buildings' construction. Rising dramatically from the shore of the historic Potomac River, two distinct structures dominated the triangular block of land: a circular council chamber and an 11-story crescent-shaped secretariat. By December 1964, texture and pattern had begun to emerge, giving each building a distinct character. Geometric diamond shapes decorated the outside of the council chamber, visually played off against the elegant vertical lines of the larger secretariat building. Gradually, other elements were added: reflecting pools, white columns, and slim concrete fins that gave the buildings a soaring quality. 

Just over two years after work began, the completed secretariat was ready to house hundreds of staff members in approximately 170,000 square feet of space, furnished with marble, paintings, sculptures, and other gifts from PAHO member nations. 
The council chamber alone could accommodate 400 delegates within its circular walls. The new PAHO headquarters was officially opened on September 27, 1965.

Photomask

In electronics manufacturing, a photomask is a special stencil which is used in photolithography to create a printed circuit board or integrated circuit. When light is shone through the photomask, certain parts where the light hits the unused circuit board are strengthened, much like what toothpaste does to the hard surfaces your teeth. When a circuit board is put through an acid bath, the parts where the light shone through the photomask stay in place, while the parts that were covered by the shadow of the photomask are eaten away by the acid. There are two prominent types of masks. "Contact" masks, which touch the surface of the silicon wafer directly. These masks are cheaper, at the price of being less precise. "Proximity" masks are placed near to, but not touching the wafer. These masks are much more expensive, but also a lot more precise. Another type is "Projection" masks, also known as "reticles", which only contain the pattern of one chip, instead of the pattern of the whole wafer.

Gastrotrich

The Gastrotricha, often called "hairy backs", are a phylum of microscopic (0.06-3.0 mm) animals abundant in fresh water and marine environments. Marine species are found mostly in between sediment particles, while terrestrial species live in the water films around grains of soil. Adults have a fixed cell number. About 700 species have been described.

Gastrotrichs are bilaterally symmetric, with a transparent body and a flat underside. Many species have a pair of short projections at the rear end. The body is covered with cilia, especially about the mouth and on the lower surface. Its two end projections have cement glands. This is a double-gland system where one gland secretes the glue and another secretes a de-adhesive. Like many microscopic animals, their movement is mainly powered by hydrostatics.

Gastrotrichs develop to a particular number of cells; further growth comes only from an increase in cell size. As is typical for such small animals, there are no respiratory or circulatory organs. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one on either side of the pharynx. Each ganglion gives rise to a single nerve cord, which runs the length of the body and includes further, smaller ganglia. The main sense organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface. Some gastrotrichs also possess light sensitive cells in the brain that work as primitive ocelli (eye spots).

Gastrotrichs are simultaneous hermaphrodites: they have both male and female sex organs. Once the sperm are produced, they are picked up by an organ on the tail that functions as a penis, and transferred to the partner. Fertilisation is internal, and the eggs are released by rupture of the body wall.

Many species reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis. In these species the male portions of the reproductive system are non-functional or entirely absent.

Some species can lay eggs that can remain dormant during times of desiccation (drought) or cold. These species produce regular eggs during good environmental conditions, which hatch in one to four days. The eggs hatch into miniature versions of the adult. The young typically reach sexual maturity in about three days, and gastrotrichs can live up to ten days under laboratory conditions.

Gastrotrichs are eutelic: each species has a genetically fixed number of cells as adults. Cell division stops at the end of embryonic development and further growth is only by cell enlargement.

Hand axe

A hand axe is a stone tool of the Lower (early) and Middle Paleolithic Stone Age. It was a bifacial, similar on both sides, and held in the hand, not with a handle like a modern axe. It was held directly in the hand, perhaps wrapped in a piece of leather.

This kind of axe is typical of the Acheulean and the Mousterian cultures, and is the longest-used tool of human history. Hand axes were certainly used for at least a million and a half years. They were made by earlier species of man, such as "Homo erectus" and "Homo neanderthalensis" (Neanderthal Man); it was one of their most important tools. The hand axe cultures were preceded by an even older Oldowan culture of primitive stone tools (2.6 to 1.7 million years ago) in Africa. Now it is known that the first stone tools were probably made by Australopithecines. They are found in the Great Rift Valley of Africa from about 3.3 million years ago.

New archaeological evidence from Baise, Guangxi, China shows that there were occasional hand axes in eastern Asia. However, as the reference shows, the artifacts were overwhelmingly choppers and flakes. The authors say "The stone tool assemblage shows close associations with the pebble tool industry... in South China".

A line known as the Movius Line divides the Old World into two parts: to the west are the hand axe areas, and to the east are the chopper or flak-and-chip areas. It is supposed that there were at least two different cultural traditions.

Older hand axes were produced by direct percussion with a stone hammer and can be distinguished by their thickness and a sinuous border. Later Mousterian handaxes were produced with a soft billet of antler or wood and are much thinner, more symmetrical and have a straight border.

An experienced flintknapper needs less than 15 minutes to produce a good quality hand axe. A simple hand axe can be made from a beach pebble in less than 3 minutes.

Hand axes are mainly made of flint, but rhyolites, phonolites, quartzites and other rather coarse rocks were used as well. It depends what rocks were available in the vicinity. Obsidian was rarely used, because it is not widely found. It produces a brilliant blade, but shatters more easily than flint.

Several basic shapes, like cordate, oval, or triangular have been distinguished, but their significance is not agreed upon.

Hand axes were no doubt a multi-purpose tool. Research on their cutting edges has shown that, in many cases, they were used for butchering meat. This would include extracting bone marrow (which would explain the pointed end) and general hacking through bone, muscle and tendons. Experiments at Boxgrove quarry would appear to back this up. We know for sure that Neanderthals, at least, were hunters of large mammals such as mammoths, and that may be true of other hand axe cultures. The need for such a heavy tool is thus easily understood. Wielding a hand axe requires considerable strength, but Neanderthals were stronger than us in their upper bodies.

Studies in the 1990s at Boxgrove, in which a butcher attempted to cut up a carcass with a hand axe, showed that the hand axe was perfect for getting at the bone marrow, which is high in protein and vitamins and thus was highly prized as a food source.

Joey Scarbury

Joey Scarbury (born June 7, 1955) is an adult contemporary singer best known for his hit song, "Theme from "The Greatest American Hero" (Believe It or Not)", in 1981.

Growing up in Thousand Oaks, California, Scarbury was continually encouraged in his ambition to sing by his mother. At the age of 14, after being spotted by songwriter Jimmy Webb's father, he was signed to a recording contract, and seemed to be destined for stardom. Scarbury's first single, "She Never Smiles Anymore," flopped, and he was soon without a record label. 

Scarbury, undaunted by what happened, stayed in music up through the 1970s singing backup for artists like Loretta Lynn, and occasionally recording his own material. Although he had a minor chart single with "Mixed Up Guy" in 1971, real chart success eluded him for the rest of the decade. This was to change when he started working for record producer and composer Mike Post. Post was hired along with Stephen Geyer to write the theme tune for a new TV series dubbed "The Greatest American Hero", about a high school teacher who comes into possession of a superhero outfit, and Scarbury was chosen to record it. An extended version of the song (3:15 compared to the television theme's minute-long length), released by Elektra Records, shot up to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. 

Scarbury could not follow it up however, and after charting at #49 with the single "When She Dances", Scarbury disappeared again from the charts. Scarbury went on to work with Post again in the mid 1980s to record the song "Back to Back", for the television series "Hardcastle and McCormick" and teamed up with Desiree Goyette to record "Flashbeagle" for the Peanuts special "It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown". He also performed the opening theme for the television series "Jennifer Slept Here".

In 1990, Scarbury found success again as a songwriter. This time, his co-written song "No Matter How High" was recorded by The Oak Ridge Boys and was a number one country music hit. His co-writer on this song was Even Stevens who previously had found success with co-writing songs for country star Eddie Rabbitt, as well as the Kenny Rogers hit "Love Will Turn You Around" from the motion picture "Six Pack".

His hit song from "The Greatest American Hero" appeared in Michael Moore's film "Fahrenheit 9/11" on the scene when President George W. Bush declares the Iraq Mission Accomplished.

In 2008, Joey was back on the radio after a long absence. His single "How Do You Sleep At Night" broke the top 40.

Scarbury has released several singles starting in 1969 on Dunhill, followed by releases on Reena, Playboy, Bell, Columbia, RCA, Big Tree, Lionel, and Elektra labels.<br>

Kenny Rankin

Kenny Rankin (February 10, 1940 – June 7, 2009) was an American pop and jazz singer and songwriter. He was originally from the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City, New York.

Rankin was raised in New York and was introduced to music by his mother, who sang at home and for friends. The area of Washington Heights, Manhattan was becoming heavily Latino during his youth, and exposure to street music may have played a part. He began recording at age 17 in 1957, eventually working as a songwriter for Columbia Records. Rankin's earliest composition, "My Carousel" was written for Carmen McRae, followed by "A Happy Guy" for teen idol Rick Nelson. He had already developed a serious amphetamine problem by that time.

He taught himself classical guitar, at age 24, inspired by the playing of Don Costa, who had started on that instrument before becoming one of the most important arrangers in popular music. He played rhythm guitar on some tracks on Bob Dylan's album "Bringing It All Back Home" (1965). Rankin developed a considerable following during the 1970s with a steady flow of albums, three of which broke into the Top 100 of the Billboard Album Chart. He liked jazz, but to make money he had to take a more pop-oriented course, and he cited singer-songwriter Laura Nyro consistently as a major influence. 

Rankin appeared on "The Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson more than twenty times. Carson was so impressed by him that he wrote the liner notes to Rankin's 1967 debut album "Mind Dusters," which featured the single "Peaceful." Rankin's friend Helen Reddy would reach #2 Adult Contemporary and #12 Pop in 1973 with a cover of it, released as her follow-up single to "I Am Woman". Georgie Fame also had a hit with this song in 1969, his only songwriting credit to hit the British charts reaching number sixteen and spending 9 weeks on the chart. 

Rankin's original song "In the Name of Love" frequently featured wordless improvisational singing and showed his range and command of articulating lyrics at a blistering waltz tempo, but performed more slowly it had a distinctly Brazilian flavor. Similar to later singer Mandy Patinkin, Rankin's speaking voice was a rich baritone, but his tessitura was an octave higher, with an occasional start at near his speaking timbre, as in "What Matters Most." His singing voice most frequently resembled a clarinet. His remarkably quick mastery of the guitar allowed him to appear, along with Randy Newman and Joni Mitchell, as one of the few self-sufficient solo acts conveying original material with harmonic richness beyond that of folk and early rock music.

He was extremely private in his early televised interviews, once stating that personal information distracted from musical performance. Later, he became more open and stated in interviews that in the 1960s and 1970s he had suffered from serious addictions which affected his career, and he credited his family, and a period of spiritual study while undergoing rehabilitation sessions, for helping him to overcome his drug and alcohol problems by the early 1980s. Some recorded songs on the Little David record label (a subsidiary of Atlantic Records) featured his wife Yvonne and his daughters singing background, as the Rankin Family Band. His album "Family" featured cover art of Rankin holding his two young daughters. The Rankins also had a son. 

Occasionally criticised for poor choice of material, considering his talents, by the 1990s, he was able to angle his repertoire to accommodate his own musical preferences and to please a new audience. Rankin's warm singing style and his soft, nylon-stringed guitar sound might suggest an artist more attuned to the supper-club circuit than the jazz arena, but his work contains many touches that appeal to the jazz audience, especially as he introduced more "standards" from the 1930s and 1940s into his performances. Reviews in the periodical "Down Beat" and later print media increasingly reinforced his jazz credentials.

Rankin's song "Haven't We Met" was performed by Mel Tormé and Carmen McRae, while Stan Getz said of him that he was "a horn with a heartbeat". Rankin's accompanists have from time to time included pianists Alan Broadbent, Mike Wofford and trombonist Bill Watrous, and on such occasions the mood slips easily into a jazz groove. But Don Costa's full orchestral arrangements were used to back his voice to critical acclaim, following a trend in the wake of Harry Nilsson with Gordon Jenkins and Linda Ronstadt with Nelson Riddle, to emulate the lush soundscape that some say was best with Frank Sinatra's Capitol recordings. Rankin was also deeply interested in Brazilian music and his "Here In My Heart," on which he used jazz guests including Michael Brecker and Ernie Watts, was recorded mostly in Rio de Janeiro. More contemporary songs were given an airing following his move to Verve Records, including the Beatles' "I've Just Seen A Face" and Leon Russell's "A Song For You."

Rankin's own unique gift for reworking classic songs such as The Beatles' "Blackbird," which he recorded for his "Silver Morning" album, so impressed Paul McCartney that he asked Rankin to perform his interpretation of the song when McCartney and John Lennon were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Rankin was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in May 2009. He died in Los Angeles, California - where he had resided for many years - from the disease on June 7, 2009. He was 69 years old.

Sarah Geronimo

Sarah Asher Tua Geronimo (born July 25, 1988) is a Filipina actress and singer. She started her career at a young age, and became famous after she won the "Star for a Night" singing contest. Her first album was "Popstar: A Dream Come True".

Sarah was already a popular singer when she met Matteo, who was just starting out in showbiz. Matteo had always expressed his admiration for Sarah as a performer.

The singer-actress revealed the news during a short interview aired on television

The couple's 3rd child Juana Luisa or Luna turns one year old

'It's all rumors, you know. Everything is fine, everything is safe and everything is good,' Matteo says

Sarah and Matteo started to work on a few projects together. Mateo joined Sarah in the movie Catch Me… I'm In Love with Gerald Anderson. He also was one of her guests in the US concert tours.

In June 2014, Sarah confirmed that they had been dating for a year. Matteo admitted in an interview that his endearment for Sarah was “mahal” after the late director Wenn Deramas posted about it on Facebook.

“Bilang mag-26 na ako, parang na-realize ko lang sa sarili ko, it's time to decide na maging normal. Maging normal na tao. Maging normal na babae. Maging normal sa emosyon ko,” she said.

Prior to confirming their relationship, the two had been spotted several times together, including during a night out with Judy Ann Santos and Ryan Agoncillo.

Jonathan Edwards (athlete)

Jonathan David Edwards, CBE, (born 10 May 1966 in London) is a former British triple jumper. He is a former Olympic, Commonwealth, European and World champion. He has held the world record in the event since 1995.

After his retirement as an athlete, Edwards has worked as an athletics commentator and presenter for BBC television. He was a devout Christian. He presented episodes of the BBC Christian worship programme "Songs of Praise". He lost faith in 2007. He was a member of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games in 2012. He is President of the Wenlock Olympian Society.

Edwards attended West Buckland School where his ability in the triple jump was seen at an early age. He was a strong all-rounder and on leaving received the school's top award for sporting and academic excellence, the Fortescue Medal. Other students with Edwards at West Buckland School included Victor Ubogu and Steve Ojomoh. Both are former Bath and England Rugby international players. Edwards now has a Sports Hall at West Buckland named after him; "The Jonathan Edwards Sports Centre". Edwards then read Physics at Durham University, attending Van Mildert College.

Because of his strong Christian beliefs, he refused to compete on Sundays at first. Eventually he decided to do so in 1993. This decision proved important, since the qualifying round at that year's World Championships took place on a Sunday. He went on to win the bronze medal.

In his breakthrough year of 1995, he produced a jump of 18.43 m (60 feet 5½ inches) at the European Cup. The leap was wind assisted and did not count for record purposes. But it was a sign of things to come as he capped an unbeaten year. He had a historic gold medal performance at the World Championships. There he broke the world record twice in the same meet. On his first jump, he became the first man to legally pass the 18-metre barrier (18.16 m/59 feet 7 inches). That record lasted for about 20 minutes. His second jump of 18.29 m made him the first to jump 60 feet. During his commentary for the 2008 Summer Olympics, Edwards said that during the 1995 World Championships, he felt as if "he could jump as far as he needed to". Later the same year Edwards became the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

During 1996 Edwards went into the Olympic games as favourite and world record holder. But it was American Kenny Harrison who took the gold with a jump of 18.09 m. Edwards walked away with the silver after a leap of 17.88 m (the longest ever jump not to win gold). Edwards won the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games. He was awarded the CBE shortly afterwards. He also won golds at the 2001 World Championships and 2002 Commonwealth Games. At one point in 2002, Edwards held all the gold medals for the "four majors" (Olympic Games, World Championships, Commonwealth Games & European Championships). He retired after the 2003 World Championships as Great Britain's most successful medal winning athlete.

Following his retirement, Edwards pursued a media career as a television presenter. He worked mainly for the BBC as a sports commentator and on programmes such as "Songs of Praise". He gave up this programme, due to his loss of faith, in February 2007.

In 2004 Edwards joined with Paula Radcliffe on an "Olympic Special Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?". The pair raised £64,000 for charity with half of that sum going to the British Olympic Association and a quarter of the sum going to Asthma UK.

He was a member of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. He represented athletes in the organisation of the 2012 Summer Olympics. He is President of the Wenlock Olympian Soceity.


An honorary doctorate was conferred upon him at a ceremony at the University of Exeter on 21 January 2006.

Later in the same year, an honorary doctorate of the university (DUniv) was conferred upon him at the winter graduation ceremony of the University of Ulster (19 December 2006).

Edwards lives with his wife Alison in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne. He has two sons, Nathan and Sam.

He initially refused to compete on Sundays due to his devout Christian beliefs. This decision cost him a chance to compete in the 1991 World Championships. However, in 1993, after much thinking and discussion with his father (a vicar), he changed his mind. He decided that God gave him his talent in order for him to compete in athletics.

On 2 February 2007 it was widely reported that Edwards had lost his faith in God despite him once saying "My relationship with Jesus and God is fundamental to everything I do. I have made a commitment and dedication in that relationship to serve God in every area of my life."

The "Daily Mail" described Edwards as a "man deeply troubled by the collapse of his Christian faith". It also revealed that a friend said "[Edwards] has a deep, theological comprehension of the Bible, making his spiritual meltdown even more unlikely ... They still go to church as a family" The "Daily Mail" article also quoted Edwards as saying that he is going through a difficult period in his life. A period that is deeply personal to him and his family such that he does not wish to comment on.

Edwards presented episodes of the Christian praise show Songs of Praise until 2007.

In an interview in "The Times" on 27 June 2007, Edwards said: "If there is no God, does that mean that life has no purpose? Does it mean that personal existence ends at death? They are thoughts that do my head in. One thing that I can say, however, is that even if I am unable to discover some fundamental purpose to life, this will not give me a reason to return to Christianity. Just because something is unpalatable does not mean that it is not true." Furthermore, in the interview with "The Times" he also stated "When you think about it rationally, it does seem incredibly improbable that there is a God." In the same interview he also said "I feel internally happier than at any time of my life." Edwards confirmed his rejection of Christianity in an interview on BBC Five Live Sportsweek on 29 July 2007.

Explosion protection

Explosion protection is meant to protect buildings and other civil engineering objects against internal and external explosions. It was widely believed until recently that a building subject to an explosive attack had a chance to remain standing only if it possessed some extraordinary resistive capacity. This belief rested on the assumption that the blast load was fully beyond our control.

The draw was held on Tuesday, 9 October 2007 at 12:00 CET in Nyon, Switzerland. It was conducted by UEFA's director of professional football Giorgio Marchetti and Michele Centenaro, UEFA's head of club competitions.

Based on paragraph 6.06 in the UEFA regulations for the current season, if two or more teams were equal on points on completion of all the group matches, the following criteria were used to determine the rankings:

Key:

All of the rounds in the final phase are two-legged, except for the final. In the event of aggregate scores being equal after normal time in the second leg, the winning team will be that which scored more goals on their away leg: if the scores in the two matches were identical, extra time is played. The away goals rule also applies if scores are equal at the end of extra time. If there are no goals scored in extra time, the tie is decided on a penalty shoot out. The team first out of the hat in each tie plays the first leg of their tie at home, and the second leg away.

The draw for the round of 32, which was conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor and Michele Centenaro, UEFA's head of club competitions, was held on Friday, 21 December 2007 at 13:00 CET in Nyon, Switzerland. The eight group winners were drawn against the eight third-placed teams, while the eight second-placed teams were drawn against the eight teams who finished third in the Champions League groups. Teams from the same group or the same country cannot be drawn together.

The first legs were played on 13 February and 14 February 2008. The second legs were played on 21 February 2008.

The draw for the Round of 16, which was conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor, was also held on Friday, 21 December 2007 at 13:00 CET in Nyon, Switzerland. The first legs were played on 6 March 2008. The second legs were played on 12 and 13 March 2008. Unlike the previous rounds, teams from the same group or country may be drawn together from the round of 16 onwards.

The draw for the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final, which was conducted by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor and Denis Law, the ambassador for the final in Manchester, was held on Friday, 14 March 2008 at 14:00 CET in Nyon, Switzerland. The first legs of the quarter-finals were played on 3 April and the second legs were played on 10 April 2008.

The semi-final matches were played on 24 April and 1 May 2008.

The final was contested by Russian side Zenit St. Petersburg and Scottish side Rangers on 14 May 2008 at the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, England. Zenit won the match 2–0, with goals from Igor Denisov and Konstantin Zyryanov coming in the last 20 minutes of the game to give Zenit their first UEFA Cup title.

It was released in the UK on November 6 2006 and internationally on December 7 2006. A limited edition version of the video was also released on October 23, 2006. It contained a bonus CD with 7 of their previous hit singles.

The DVD release does not include "Sure" (which was mixed the Gorillaz version of "Dirty Harry" for the tour), usually performed between "Apache 2006" and "Relight My Fire" for an unknown reason. However a few seconds of the footage can be seen in the various DVD menus.

The DVD was re-released on November 5, 2007 on HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc.



B of the Bang

B of the Bang was a sculpture in Manchester, England. It was next to the City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity. The work was designed by Thomas Heatherwick. It was taken apart in 2009 due to structural problems.

Commissioned to mark the 2002 Commonwealth Games, it was one of the tallest structures in the City of Manchester. It was the tallest sculpture in the UK until the completion of "Aspire" in 2008. It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The sculpture took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie. In the quotation he said that he started his races not at the "bang" of the starting pistol, but at 'The B of the Bang'.

The sculpture was commissioned in 2003. Construction went longer than planned and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005. Six days before the launch, the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems. The tip of one of the spikes came off and fell to the ground. Legal action started a year later, resulting in an out-of-court settlement totalling £1.7m.

In February 2009 Manchester City Council announced that the sculpture would be taken apart and placed in storage, as the "only practical alternative". The council said it was committed to working closely with the design team in order to "determine whether there is a robust and affordable strategy for the re-construction of the structure on the site". Despite the promise of storage and potential reassembly, the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal.

"B of the Bang" originally stood tall. It had 180 hollow tapered steel columns or spikes coming out of a central core. It was angled at 30 degrees and supported by five long, tapered steel legs. These connected to the spikes above the ground. The sculpture weighed 165 tonnes. The concrete in the foundations weighed over 1,000 tonnes, including a reinforced concrete slab. The foundations are deep.

The sculpture was made from the same weathering steel (also known as Cor-Ten) as the Angel of the North sculpture. This slowly develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements. This layer prevents further corrosion by reducing its permeability to water. As part of the design, the spikes moved slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts over . At the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture. It contained children's poems and paintings, due to be opened around 2300. The location of the time capsule after being taken apart is currently unknown.

"B of the Bang" was next to the City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity, in Beswick, at the corner of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road; coordinates . It took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the 'bang' of the starting pistol, but at 'The B of the Bang'. The artwork had been nicknamed "KerPlunk" by the locals after the popular children's game from the 1970s.

Prior to the construction of Aspire at the University of Nottingham, "B of the Bang" was Britain's tallest sculpture. It stood at twice the height of the Angel of the North. Angel of the North is tall. It was designed to look like an exploding firework. It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It was commissioned by New East Manchester Limited to commemorate the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in 2002. The sculpture was designed by Thomas Heatherwick.

The sculpture was constructed in Sheffield by Thomas Heatherwick Studio, Packman Lucas, Flint and Neill and Westbury Structures. It was approved at the start of 2003, with the central core arriving in Manchester on the 13 June 2004. This was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory, and required a police escort. This central core was lifted into place in August 2004, after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached. Early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of July 2003, which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname "G of the Bang".

The official unveiling by Linford Christie took place on 12 January 2005.

In total the sculpture cost £1.42 million to design and construct — twice the original estimate, as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs. Funding was sourced from a European Regional Development Fund contribution of £700,000, the North West Development Agency, contributing £500,000, and Manchester City Council providing £120,000.

The tip of one of the spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on the 6 January 2005, only six days before the official unveiling. After inspection, the event went ahead as planned.

Four months later, in May 2005, a second spike had to be cut off by firefighters after it was discovered hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 170 of the spikes.

Despite these modifications, "B of the Bang" remained fenced off, prompting a local newspaper campaign to 'Get It Sorted'. In May 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for metallurgical analysis, to discover the stresses being placed on the steel.

It was announced in October 2007 that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture, with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture. In November 2008 this culminated in an out-of-court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council, the project's designers Thomas Heatherwick Studio Ltd, and the engineering and construction subcontractors Packman Lucas Ltd, Flint and Neill Partnership and Westbury Structures Ltd. The agreement was to pay the council £1.7m in damages for breach of contract and negligence.

Acting on a report in January 2009, the city council recommended that "B of the Bang" should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement. The report recognised the sculpture's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long-term solution. One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre, although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing.

In January 2009, Antony Gormley, creator of the Angel of the North — to which "B of the Bang" is often compared — spoke out in support of the sculpture, stating that, ""It is a great tribute to Manchester that this ground-breaking work was commissioned. To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council's nerve."" 

Despite Gormley's plea, removal of "B of the Bang" began in April 2009. More substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm Connell Bros Ltd. began removing the spikes with oxyacetylene cutting equipment.

Although the council had earlier promised to store the complex central core and legs, these too were cut apart during removal, casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture's return.

Ron Brand

Ron Brand (born January 13, 1940) is a former baseball player. He mostly played as a catcher. He started his career for the Clinton Pirates. After six years he joined the Pittsburgh Pirates. He hit his first home run off Denny Lemaster. He was then selected in the Rule 5 Draft by the Houston Astros. With the Astros he competed to be starting catcher with John Bateman. After four years in Houston, he was picked in the expansion draft, which is when new teams pick players that other teams do not want, by the Montreal Expos. He played for the Expos as a catcher in 1969, but then made some appearances at shortstop over the next two years. He played his last game on September 25, 1971. He then went back to the minor leagues. He managed for a few years as well.

Ewing's sarcoma

Ewing's sarcoma is a type of bone cancer. It is a rare type of bone cancer which is found mainly in children. It found in boys more often than girls. It is not usually found in people over 30 years old. It is named after James Ewing, the doctor who first described it in 1921. 

People with Ewing's sarcoma usually feel pain, and may have a lump. They can get fevers and lose weight. In some cases the tumor can eat into the bone and cause it to fracture easily.

Bone tumor

A bone tumor is any tumor in bones. Examples of bone tumors include osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma.

Sticky keys

Sticky keys are activated when a computer user presses the "Shift" key five times. This lets the user capitalize a letter without having to press down the "Shift" key.

Sticky Keys is a Microsoft Windows accessibility feature that causes modifier keys to remain active, even after they have been pressed and released, making it easier to do keyboard shortcuts.

Unincorporated area

An unincorporated area is land that is not part of a town, city, or anything like a town. Often, there are not many people there.

Often, unincorporated areas are governed by a bigger administration, such as a county. It is usually a place that some people live, but they are not any official city. Sometimes, they are called an unincorporated community.

Some states have different rules for a place to become an official city. 

Chapters and verses of the Bible

The books of the Bible that are considered canonical number 24 for Jews, 66 for Protestants, 73 for Catholics, and 78 for most Orthodox Christians. In addition to these, many versions of the Bible contain books which have not been considered canonical by their publishers, called apocrypha. All these books have different lengths from a single page of modern type to dozens of pages. All but the shortest are divided into chapters, generally a page or two in length.

Glioma

A glioma is a type of brain tumor that starts in the glial cells.
Thalidomide and carmustine have been used. Surgical removal of the tumor and radiotherapy are also used.


Subset sum problem

The subset sum problem is an important problem of computer science. It can be stated as follows: Given a set of integers, does any subset of them sum to zero? For example, given the set { -7, -3, -2, 5, 8}, the answer is "yes" because the subset { -3, -2, 5} sums to zero. The problem is NP-Complete. It can be reformulated to the 3SAT. 
An alternative statement of this problem is, given a set of numbers and an integer x determine whether or not there exist a subset that sums up to x.
Eg. given a set {1, 4, 6, 7} and x = 10 the answer is "yes" because {4, 6} sums to 10. 
Remember that the subsequence need not to be contiguous. For instance if x = 8 in above example the answer is still yes because {1, 7} sums to 8.

Yun Chi-ho

Yun Chi-Ho (1865–1945) was a Choson politician and a Korean Christian activist. He was part of the independence movement against Japanese Imperialism. Yun Chi-Ho is the uncle of Yun Bo-sun (), South Korea's 4th president and well known by his pen-name Jwaong ().

Yun was a human and civil right activist and part of the national liberation movement, member of an independent club, member of the 10,000 people club and managing editor of an independent news paper.
He was against the Japanese invasion of Korea. However, he turned away from Korean independence activism in 1915 to become a pro-Japanese activist.

Yun Chi-ho was born in Asan to a notable family. His father Yun Ung-ryeol was an illegitimate son of his grandfather Yun Chwe-dong.
From 1881 until 1883 he studied abroad in Japan and after 1884 he returned to Korea. At that time he was a staff of Def. foreign of Korea. In October 1884 he participated in the Gapsin coup. He escaped to China and Qing dynasty.

In 1884, he was wandering to Shanghai where he met a missionary. The missionary's propagation was to one religion and he went to the Protestant church. To stay in china he had to learn at Dungwu college. Later Yun graduated at Dungwu college and went to America. He was a self-supporting student, because his homes where not propertys. 

He was admitted to Vanderbilt University and Emory University. Vanderbilt stay Yun was study for Humanities, Social Sciences, Emory University was theology and philosopher. In 1895, he returned to his nation. He was popular right and Participation in government affairs movements.

Squat

Squat is a renowned element of many folk dances. 
In powerlifting and bodybuilding, as well as in other sports, squat is an exercise that strengthens the muscles of the thighs, hips and buttocks, as well as the bones, ligaments and insertion of the tendons throughout the lower body.

Although the squat is a basic element of weight training, it has been the subject of considerable controversy in recent years. Some trainers allege that squats are associated with injuries to the lumbar spine and knees. As a result, many trainers suggest that the standard barbell squat be modified in various ways. Others, however, reject all suggestions that the exercise be abandoned, continuing to advocate the squat.

John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury

John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury PC, FRS (30 April 1834 – 28 May 1913), known as Sir John Lubbock, 4th Bt from 1865 until 1900, was an English banker, biologist, archaeologist and Liberal politician.

Lubbock was the son of Sir John Lubbock, 3rd Baronet, and was brought up in the family home of High Elms, near Downe in Kent. In 1842 his father brought home a "great piece of news". Young John Lubbock thought it might be a new pony, and was disappointed that the news was that Charles Darwin was moving to Down House in the village. He was soon a frequent visitor to Down House, and became the closest of Darwin's younger friends.

Lubbock was educated at Eton College from 1845 and afterwards was taken into his father's bank, where he became a partner at the age of twenty-two. In 1865 he succeeded to the baronetcy.

In 1870, 1874, and 1880 he was elected to Parliament, where he promoted a number of laws. Lubbock was elected the first president of the Institute of Bankers in 1879; in 1881 he was president of the British Association, and from 1881 to 1886 president of the Linnean Society of London. In March 1883 he founded the Bank Clerks Orphanage, which in 1986 became the Bankers Benevolent Fund – a charity for bank employees, past and present and their dependants. In January 1884 he founded the Proportional Representation Society, later to become the Electoral Reform Society.

Lubbock received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Dublin and Würzburg; and in 1878 was appointed a trustee of the British Museum. From 1888 to 1892 he was president of the London Chamber of Commerce; from 1889 to 1890 vice-chairman and from 1890 to 1892 chairman of the London County Council.

In February 1890 he was appointed a Privy Councillor, and was chairman of the committee of design on the new coinage in 1891. In January 1900 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Avebury, his title commemorating the largest Neolithic site in Europe.

In 1865 Lubbock published what was possibly the most influential archaeological text book of the 19th Century, "Pre-historic times, as illustrated by ancient remains, and the manners and customs of modern savages". He invented the terms Palaeolithic and Neolithic to denote the Old and New Stone Ages respectively, but more notable was his introduction of a Darwinian view of human nature. 

Lubbock was also an amateur biologist of some distinction, writing books on hymenoptera, on insect sense organs and development, on the intelligence of animals, and on other natural history topics. As a politician, one of his successes was in the passing of the Importation of Plumage Prohibition Act 1908. He was a member of the famous X Club founded by T.H. Huxley to promote the growth of science in Britain. He discovered that ants were sensitive to the ultraviolet range of the spectrum. The Punch verse of 1882 captured him perfectly:

He carried out extensive correspondence with Charles Darwin, who lived nearby in Downe. In addition to their shared interest in natural history, both men were active advocates of spelling reform, and members of the Spelling Reform Association. When Darwin died in 1882, Lubbock suggested the honour of burial in Westminster Abbey, and was one of the pallbearers.


Georges Seurat

Seurat painted for a time with the Impressionist painters, Claude Monet, Renoir, Sisley and Pissarro. His scientific ideas about color then led him to develop a different painting technique. He painted in tiny dots of color, with the theory that the viewer's eye would mix them. This technique is called "pointillism".

Seurat and his followers are often referred to as the Neo-Impressionists ("New Impressionists"). His most famous paintings are "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte" (18841886) in the Chicago Art Institute and "Bathers at Asnières" (1884) in the National Gallery, London. 


Eugène Boudin

Eugène Boudin (12 July 1824 – 8 August 1898) was a French painter of landscapes and seascapes. He was one of the first landscape painters to paint outdoors, rather than in a studio. He was a great influence on the French Impressionists.

Boudin was born in Honfleur, France, and was the son of a sailor. In 1835 his father opened a small shop in Le Havre where Boudin worked with him, selling stationery and making picture frames. Boudin met many artists who put their paintings for sale in the shop. In his early twenties, Boudin went to Paris to study painting. He returned often to paint the seashores around his home. 

In 1856 Boudin met Claude Monet who spent several months working with Boudin in his studio. The two remained lifelong friends. Monet later said that Boudin had been a major influence on him, teaching him to paint outdoors. Camille Corot who was one of the greatest influences on Monet and the other Impressionists, gazed at Boudin's work and said "You are the master of the sky." 

The Eugene Boudin Prize is an award given by the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts of France.


Boolean satisfiability problem

The Boolean satisfiability problem is a kind of problem in math-based logic. In propositional logic, a formula is "satisfiable" if the variables it uses can be given values so that it becomes true. If however for a given formula, no values exist so that the formula becomes true and the formula will always be false no matter what values its variables have it is called "unsatisfiable".

This problem is also known as "Boolean or propositional satisfiability". Computer scientists usually call it SAT. Complexity theory believes that the formula should be in a special form, known as conjunctive normal form. A formula that is in this form has clauses. Clauses are joined by a "logical and". Each clause has several literals. They are joined by a "logical or". A literal and its complement cannot appear in the same clause. The problem may also have other names. The names depend on what the logical formula looks like. The names also depend on how many variables are used per clause.

A formula that satisfies 3SAT looks like the following:

In this case "("A" OR "B" OR "C")" is an example for a clause, and "B" is one of the literals of this clause.

At the beginning of the 1970s, Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin showed that the problem is NP-complete. This is known as the Cook–Levin theorem. 

The problem 3SAT uses three variables per clause. It is one of the 21 NP-complete problems. They were defined by Richard Karp in 1972.

Denny Lemaster

Denver Clayton Lemaster (born February 25, 1939 in Corona, California) was a Major League Baseball pitcher. He began his career when he was signed by the Milwaukee Braves. He spent 1958-early 1962 in the minors. He joined the Braves in 1962, and pitched his first game on June 15th. He played with the Braves until 1967. They had moved to Atlanta by that time. After the 1967 season he was traded to the Astros with Denis Menke. The Braves were given Sonny Jackson and Chuck Harrison. Lemaster played with the Astros for four years. He was then sold to the Montreal Expos, but was released halfway through the season.

NP-complete

An NP problem is an algorithmic problem such that if you have a case of the problem of size formula_1, the number of steps needed to check the answer is smaller than the value of some polynomial in formula_1. It doesn't mean one can find an answer in the polynomial number of steps, only check it. 

An NP-complete problem is an NP problem such that if one could find answers to that problem in polynomial number of steps, one could also find answers to all NP problems in polynomial number of steps. This makes NP-complete decision problems the hardest problems in NP (they are NP-hard). People spent lots of time looking for algorithms that finds answers to some NP-complete problem in polynomial number of steps, but have not found any. Because of this, if someone shows a problem to be NP-complete, it is not likely that there is an algorithm solving it in polynomial number of steps.

The unsolved problem P = NP asks whether polynomial time algorithms actually exist for NP-complete, and by corollary, all NP problems. It is widely believed that this is not the case.

The Travelling salesman problem is an NP-Complete problem.

Cook–Levin theorem

The Cook–Levin theorem is a theorem from theoretical computer science, which says that the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete. A deterministic Turing machine can change a problem in NP in polynomial time to the problem of determining whether a Boolean formula is satisfiable. An important consequence of the theorem is that if there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving Boolean satisfiability, then there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving "all" problems in NP. The same follows for any NP-complete problem. 

The question of whether such an algorithm exists is called the P versus NP problem and it is widely considered the most important unsolved problem in theoretical computer science. The theorem is named after Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin, who first described it in the 1970s.

Bill France, Sr.

William Henry Getty France Sr. (September 26, 1909 – June 7, 1992) was an American racecar driver, best known for being the co-founder of NASCAR. France was born in Washington, D.C.. He is also known as the creator of the Daytona International Speedway and the Talladega Superspeedway. France was put into the NASCAR Hall of Fame on May 23 2010.

France was the father of Bill France, Jr. (1933-2007) and grandfather of Brian France.

Denis Menke

Denis John Menke (July 21, 1940 – December 1, 2020) was a professional baseball infielder.

He was born on July 23, 1940, in Bancroft, Iowa. He was signed by the Milwaukee Braves in 1958. He came to the major leagues in 1962. 

He became a regular player in 1963. He was traded with Denny Lemaster to the Astros in 1967. He played for Houston for four years, and was elected to the All-Star team as a backup player twice. He was then part of an eight-player trade the Astros made with the Reds. The trade was Menke, Ed Armbrister, Jack Billingham, Cesar Geronimo, and future Hall-of-Famer Joe Morgan for All-star Lee May, All-star Tommy Helms, and Jimmy Stewart. 

He played in the 1972 World Series. He batted .083 in 24 at-bats.

Menke died at his home in Tarpon Springs, Florida on December 1, 2020 at the age of 80.

Huaso

A huaso (feminine huasa, but most commonly china) is a Chilean countryman and skilled horseman, very similar to the gauchos, cowboys, vaqueros and charros. Huasos are found in central and southern Chile. 

Huasos are an important part of the culture of Chile, and are a vital part of parades, parties, and holidays. The Region of O'Higgins is the place where are found the most of the Chilean huasos.


Purchase

Purchasing is the buying of goods or services. An item that has been bought is called a purchase. The opposite of a purchase is a sale. In common usage, the shorter word "buy" is typically used when shopping, rather than the word "purchase".

However, the word has been used in many major historical terms, including:

The word "purchase" is often used in contracts with "acquisition", as in the term "Acquisitions and Mergers" (A&M) in legal agreements made between large companies. Those contracts typically state than a company was "purchased" by another company.

Stargate (movie)

Stargate is a 1994 science fiction movie, starring Kurt Russell as Colonel Jonathan Jack O'Neil, James Spader as Dr. Daniel Jackson and Jaye Davidson as Ra.

Although the movie got mixed reviews from movie critics, it did very well at the box office with a revenue of $196.6 million, which was nearly four times higher than its budget of $55 million. The financial success of this movie also started the Hollywood career of Roland Emmerich and it became a cult movie.

In a dig at Giza in 1928, scientists find a big metalic ring inscribed with hieroglyphics. Archeologist Doctor Daniel Jackson is called by the U.S. Air Force to translate hieroglyphics on the ring. They find out that the ring is actually a piece of alien technology that creates wormholes to transport people across the universe. A military team under the command of the U.S. Air Force Colonel Jonathan Jack O'Neil goes through the stargate with Jackson, and after the journey find out that they cannot get back to Earth. They find a city of ancient Egyptian-like people under the tyrannical rule of Ra, who is an alien posing as their god. They eventually kill Ra with a nuclear blast and figure out how to get back to Earth, but Jackson gets married and stays on the planet.

Gnathostomulida

Gnathostomulids, or jaw worms, are a small phylum of marine invertebrates which were discovered in 1956. They are tiny worm-like marine animals. They live in sand and mud beneath shallow coastal waters and can survive in relatively anoxic environments. 

Most gnathostomulids measure 0.5 to 1 millimetre (0.02 to 0.04 in) in length. They are slender to thread-like worms, with a transparent body. The neck region is slightly narrower than the rest of the body, giving them a distinct head. 

Like flatworms they have a ciliated epidermis, but are unique in having but one cilium per cell. The cilia allow the worms to glide along in the water between sand grains, although they also have muscles that allow the body to twist or contract. 

They have no circulatory or respiratory system. The nervous system is very simple, and restricted to the outer layers of the body wall. The only sense organs are modified cilia, which are especially common in the head region.

The mouth is just behind the head, on the underside of the body. It has a pair of muscular jaws supplied with minute teeth, and a plate on the lower surface that bears a comb-like structure which they use to scrape smaller organisms off of the grains of sand that make up their anoxic seabed mud habitat. The mouth opens into a blind-ending tube in which digestion takes places; there is no anus. 

There are approximately 100 described species and certainly many more as yet undescribed. Gnathostomulids have no fossil record.

Gnathostomulids are simultaneous hermaphrodites. Each individual possesses a single ovary and one or two testes. After fertilisation, the single egg ruptures through the body wall and adheres to nearby sand particles; the parent is able to rapidly heal the resulting wound. The egg hatches into a miniature version of the adult, without a larval stage.

Epidermis

The epidermis is the skin or surface layer of an animal or plant. At its most basic, it is a sheet of cells. The cells are continually replaced by cell division (mitosis), and the layer (in animals) is sensitive to stimuli such as touch.

2010 Pacific hurricane season

The 2010 Pacific hurricane season was the least active season since 1977, it officially started on May 15, 2010 and on June 1st for the Central Pacific and officially ended on November 30, 2010. These dates are when a storm is likely to start in 2010. The first storm of this season formed about two weeks before the first storm of 2009 did. So far, there have been five tropical depression, four of those five became a tropical storm, while only one because a hurricane. In addition, one storm, Hurricane Celia, was the second earliest category 5 hurricane on record

The first storm, Tropical Storm Agatha killed at least 196 people in Central America. No other storms in the 2010 Pacific hurricane season have affected land yet.

The first storm of the season started from a tropical disturbance, which is similar to a tropical wave. This tropical disturbance grew into Tropical Depression One-E on May 29. Tropical Depression One quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and it was given the name "Agatha". Moving toward land, Tropical Storm Agatha peak as a weak tropical storm with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Tropical Storm Agatha had made landfall near the Mexico and Guatemala border. Agatha had quickly died over land on May 30 after moving northward.

Tropical Storm Agatha killed about 146 people in Central America.

Tropical Depression Two-E started on June 16 from a tropical wave. Moving just south of the Mexican coast, winds top at 30 mph (45 km/h), which was too low for a storm to be a tropical storm. Remaining off the coast, Tropical Depression Two-E dissipated on June 17 without becoming a tropical storm.

Rains from Tropical Depression Two-E caused flooding, which damage about 82 houses and affected 40 other houses near the coast. In addition, some people lost there roofs because of high winds. No people were killed by Tropical Depression Two-E.

On June 17, Tropical Depression Four-E started from an area of low pressure. Tropical Depression Four-E strengthened fast, and had become Tropical Storm Blas just one hour later. Blas became a strong tropical storm and had its highest winds at 65 mph (100 km/h) on June 19. It began to weakened slowly as it headed into colder waters. The next day, Blas weakened to a tropical depression and died the following day, June 21. Tropical Storm Blas remained far enough from land to cause no affects. 

Celia formed from an area of low pressure on June 19, and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane. On June 21 Celia became a Category 2 hurricane and on June 23 strengthened further to become a Category 3 for a little while before weakening again due to bad conditions. After these bad conditions disappeared, Celia strengthened again and became a Category 5 hurricane on June 24, and the strongest storm of the season so far. However Celia moved into a part of the ocean with dry air above it and Celia weakened to a tropical storm quickly, before dying out completely. Celia was far enough away from land to not cause any damage.

The remnants of Tropical Depression Eleven-E crossed over to the Gulf Of Mexico and re-strengthened as Tropical Storm Hermine

The following names will be used for named storms that form in East Pacific in 2010. Names that were not used are marked in , and names in bold are storms currently active. This list is the same as it was in the 2004 season.

For the central Pacific Ocean, four names are used. A central Pacific name is given if a named storm starts near Hawaii. The next four names are shown here:

Regeneration

Regeneration means that an organism regrows a lost part, so that the original function is restored. It is a term in developmental biology.

The ability to regenerate differs in different groups. Whereas newts, for example, can regenerate severed limbs, mammals cannot. Limb regeneration in newts occurs in two major steps, first de-differentiation of adult cells into a stem cell state similar to embryonic cells and second, development of these cells into new tissue more or less the same way it developed the first time. 

Simpler animals like flatworms can regenerate because the adults retain clusters of stem cells in their bodies. These can migrate to damaged parts of the body, then divide and differentiate to provide the missing tissue.

Context (computing)

Context in computer science refers to a specific set of data, which is related to a task. It must be saved to allow a task interruption to happen at a given date, a continuation of this task at the point it has been interrupted, and at an arbitrary future date. Context is important when tasks can be interrupted. Upon being interrupted, the processor saves the context. It then continues with the Interrupt Service Routine. The latency will be smaller if the context is smaller. The context data will sometimes be located in Processor registers, the computer memory, or control registers on some operating systems.

The storage memory is not concerned by the task context in the case of a context switch, even if this can be stored for some uses (checkpointing).

Ecchi

Ecchi (from Japanese エッチ "etchi") is from the Japanese word meaning "lewd", "sexy", "pervert", or "naughty" when used as an adjective, or it can mean to have sex when it is used as a verb or noun. The English use of this word is usually used in manga and anime, used when it has sexual content, such as not much clothing or nudity, but does not show sex. 

Ecchi anime is also sometimes filled with innuendo and sexual humor. Ecchi anime doesn’t show sex, at least not in a clear way. 

Ecchi is similar to hentai, though it doesn’t go as far. The term itself may be from the word hentai, but the origins are unclear. Ecchi means “h”. 

A character in anime is often called ecchi, or even hentai, when he is perceived as being a pervert. In an anime like Love Hina it’s usually because of a comedic mistake or blunder.

Oxalidaceae

The Oxalidaceae is a family of flowering plants. This family has about 900 species, mainly of annual or perennial herbs. These are found mainly in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, although some occur in temperate locations.

Ganglion

In anatomy, a ganglion (plural ganglia) is a mass of tissue in the nervous system. It is a group of nerve cells which do a job in the nervous system. Ganglia are basically clusters of nerve cell bodies. They may have thousands of nerve cell bodies working on some particular function. We perceive the brain's action as a whole. We cannot perceive ("see") the activity unless it goes wrong.

In the brain, the basal ganglia is a group of nuclei interconnected with the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem. They do various things: motor control, cognition, emotions, and learning.
In invertebrates, ganglia often do the work of a brain. In cases like the earthworm, there is a ganglion above the gut at the front. This is linked to another under the gut by nerve fibres running down each side of the gut. The rest of the central nervous system runs under the gut. This type of arrangement in found in a number of invertebrate phyla, and contrasts with the vertebrates, who have their spinal cord above (dorsal to) their gut.

In another usage, ganglion cells are found in the retina of the vertebrate eye.

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder

Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a personality disorder. People with OCPD are obsessed with rules and order, and can feel worried or angry when things do not seem right. This can lead to routines and rules for ways of doing things, for themselves and the people around them.

People with OCPD pay an unusual amount of attention to details, rules, lists, order, organization, and schedules. It is very hard to get them to change their minds. They are perfectionist and want themselves to always be working and doing it right. Because of this, they are afraid to let other people do things in case they do it wrong.

Some people with OCPD, but not all of them, have a strong need to be clean. Those that do not show this tendency are sometimes good at setting up systems to keep clean, but may not follow through with the need to clean because of other "more important" things. For example, the need to finish a project at work might cause the OCPD person to have a quite unorganized home. But if that same person was suddenly unemployed or finished with other things, they could very well start becoming more concerned about being clean as they have more free time.

OCPD people sometimes do not finish things on time because too much time is used in getting it to be just right. Friends and family are often under serious strain because the OCPD individual must be in charge and the only one who knows what is right. Not being clean or tidy enough is seen by some OCPD individuals as not being perfect enough. They may regularly spend a lot of time putting things in exactly the right place in exactly the right way. OCPD sufferers can be worried about things going wrong in their lives, and hoard money just in case.

For a person with fully developed OCPD, actions and beliefs are either completely right or completely wrong, and they are always right. Because of this, interpersonal relationships are difficult as the person demands too much of their friends, partners, and children. When people do not do what they want, sometimes people with OCPD turn to anger and even violence. They often suffer from depression. This can sometimes be so serious that they might commit suicide. One study suggests that disorders like OCPD can make people more depressed than actually having major depressive disorder.

People with OCPD, when anxious or excited, may have tics, pull faces, or make noises like people with Tourette syndrome, or do and surprising things.

Red Dead Redemption

Red Dead Redemption is an action-adventure western video game made by Rockstar San Diego. It was released in May 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is a spiritual successor to 2004's "Red Dead Revolver".

"Red Dead Redemption" gives the player a big and open world environment. This allows the player to move freely. Players on foot can walk, talk, shoot, kill, ride, run, interact with the environment. Players may also fight enemies with firearms. Different breeds of horses is how the player mainly gets around. Players cannot go swimming, because the main character John Marston cannot swim and will drown if the player goes too far into the water (though he is able to go where the water is shallow).

The open world environment allows players to choose how they want to play. Storyline missions are for progress. Players can also take part in many events they come across as they explore the world. Some examples are public hangings, ambushes, cries for help, and animal attacks. Players can also take part in optional side activities ranging from standoffs, five fingers fillet game, gambling, and hunting animals for pelts and meat.

"Red Dead Redemption" makes use of an honesty system. This is when players have the chance to get good or bad 'honor'. Some of the ways to get good honor are like taking an outlaw alive instead of killing him, or saving a kidnapped person. Bad honor can be gotten for doing crimes like killing and/or robbing people. This works along with another system, 'fame,' showing and governing how people react based on Marston's honor status.

A trailer of the game was sent to a select number of people at a Sony meeting in 2005. It helped the release of the PlayStation 3 system. The trailer was a tech demo of Rockstar Advanced Game Engine. It was set in a western setting thought to as "Old West Project" and a sequel to "Red Dead Revolver". The trailer flowed throughout the internet. In the April edition of "Game Informer", "Red Dead Redemption" was listed as being for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

On February 3, 2009, Rockstar Games showed the first official trailer. Resulting trailers had many characters, gameplay features, and multiplayer modes that will be shown in the final release. The game was shown on NASCAR driver Joey Logano's number 20 Toyota Camry in the Nationwide Series running of the O'Reilly 300. This took place at the Texas Motor Speedway on April 17, 2010. In North America, television network Fox plans to show a half-hour in-game special. It will be directed by John Hillcoat on May 29, 2010.

In North America, GameStop and Rockstar worked with each other on a pre-order bonus. This bonus would let customers vote for one of three outfits that Marston could unlock in the game. Each outfit came with a different bonus. For example, the "Deadly Assassin" outfit allows Marston to restart slow-mo "Dead-Eye" targeting twice as fast. The "Savvy Merchant" outfit would cut in half the purchasing price of ammunition and guns and double the selling price for ammunition and guns. And the "Expert Hunter" outfit would double the amount of money the player could get from selling hides of animals. Voting was open to all, but only those who pre-ordered the game through Gamestop will get the winning outfit, the "Deadly Assassin".

Along with the GameStop pre-order special, there are many other pre-order bonuses through other game stores. These game stores are throughout North America, Europe, and Australia. These are the "War Horse" and the "Golden Guns". The "War Horse" is a black horse with a white mane, tail and markings thought as "rare" as well as being "faster" and having "more health" than any other horse in the game. The "Golden Guns" reward increases fame with each kill. This allows users to progress much faster up the ladder of fame. The official online Rockstar Games store, the "Rockstar Warehouse," offers a "Red Dead Redemption" T-shirt as the pre-order bonus. With some countries getting the "Golden Guns" and the "War Horse," all will have the Deadly Assassin outfit along with the first soundtrack.
Limited additional showings such as a new gang hideout and a walton gang outfit, is available for the PlayStation 3 version of the game. Plus, some awards in the game unlock rewards for PlayStation Home, PlayStation 3's online social gaming network.

"Red Dead Redemption Original Soundtrack" is the soundtrack of video game music from the game "Red Dead Redemption". The music was mostly made by Friends of Dean Martinez member Bill Elm and ex-member Woody Jackson along with some other people from many musicians like Swedish folk musician José González.

The game got a lot of praise when it was released. It also got a lot of good reviews from the views of the open world, story, and soundtrack. The game has gotten a 95/100 on both Metacritic and GameRankings. On Metacritic, it is the 5th best rated Xbox 360 game of all time and the 3rd best rated PlayStation 3 game of all time. On GameRankings both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game are on the "All-Time Best" video game list.

"The New York Times" game review reporter said, ""In the more than 1,100 articles I have written for this newspaper since 1996, I have never before called anything a tour de force. Yet there is no more succinct and appropriate way to describe "Red Dead Redemption"."

IGN gave good reviews on the game giving it a 9.7/10. They said, ""What is most impressive about this sandbox is how fun it is to simply hop on a horse and take off across the prairie"." In the end they said ""Red Dead Redemption is a must-play game. Rockstar has taken the Western to new heights and created one of the deepest, most fun, and most gorgeous games around. You can expect the occasional bug or visual hiccup, but you can also expect a fantastic game that offers the Western experience we've all been waiting for"." GameSpot awarded the game 9.5/10 and said that it "raises the bar for open world action games".

http://www.change.org/petitions/rockstar-games-port-red-dead-redemption-on-pc

GameSpy gave it 5/5 stars saying ""With Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar succeeds in creating one of the most impressive open worlds I've ever seen in a game, and it's telling that — even after playing for over 30 hours — all I want to do is get back on my horse and gallop back into the wilderness"." VideoGamer gave it a 10/10 saying ""The game itself is absolutely spectacular... The sheer quality of Red Dead Redemption is evident right from the word go." They also said "it's a magnificent piece of work that everybody should play"."

Eurogamer gave Red Dead Redemption an 8/10, saying ""successfully re-clothes the Grand Theft Auto framework in an exciting, distinct and expertly realised scenario"".

Hypertrophy

In biology, hypertrophy is the increase in size of an organ, beyond normal growth. Hypertrophy happens because the cells grow bigger. The condition where an organ is bigger, because there are more cells is called hyperplasia. 

Some cells like adipocytes (fat cells) get larger by expanding outward while filling up with more lipid contents, while myocytes (muscle cells) can fuse with other myocytes to form huge myotube cells. Organs or tissues can grow larger due to the enlargement of their component cells. One of the most common and visible forms of normal, organ hypertrophy occurs in skeletal muscles in response to strength training or bodybuilding.

In contrast, tissues and organs can also get larger by another mechanism, hyperplasia, in which the cells remain approximately the same size but increase in number. Although hypertrophy and hyperplasia are two distinct processes, they frequently occur together. The hormonally-induced proliferation and enlargement of the cells of the uterus during pregnancy is an example of this combination under normal conditions. In some tumors, enlargement can occur by an increase in the number of cells together with the occurrence of some abnormally large cells.


Spiritual successor

A Spiritual successor, sometimes called a Spiritual sequel or a Companion piece, is a sequel to a work of fiction which does not have the same storyline made in the first. Spiritual successors still have the same elements, themes, and styles as the first.

The nature of the publisher/maker system are basic in almost all computer games. As well as the purchase and takeovers by many companies. These are reasons why creative teams often lose to keep the copyright and trademark rights of what they made. This often makes attempts to make sequels for a product not possible for many reasons. One of the reasons it the "core" of the studio being fired or taken over after finishing a project while the parent company keeps control of the copyrights and trademarks. A good example of this strategy is Electronic Arts. They have closed many studios while keeping their copyrights and trademarks, such as Bullfrog Productions, Origin Systems, and Westwood Studios.

To get around this, creative teams will make a product that is kind of like the first game in some way, without copying the first directly. For example, the video games "TimeSplitters" and, "Perfect Dark" are often thought to be the spiritual successors to the hit video game "GoldenEye 007".

Other times, a spiritual successor is made when the first products were either poor commercial sellers and/or forgotten by the people that would purchase the product. By leaving the first product's name and maybe its baggage as a forgotten product, the spiritual sequel can be loved by fresh eyes. An example of this would be "BioShock", which has been named to by its makers as the spiritual successor to "System Shock 2". "System Shock" and "System Shock 2" both got good reviews, but both failed to get the expected commercial success. Unlike "BioShock", which was both a reviewer and commercial success.



William Gibson

William Gibson (born March 17, 1948) is a writer. He writes science fiction books. He is one of the most important people in the part of science fiction called cyberpunk. His most famous book is "Neuromancer".

William Ford Gibson was born in Conway, South Carolina on the Atlantic coast. He spent most of his childhood in Wytheville, Virginia. Whytheville is a small town in the Appalachians. His parents had been born and raised there.

Gibson was shy and awkward as a teenager. He grew up in a place and time where most people thought and acted alike. This was a problem for him. He chose not to believe in religion. He read science fiction and writers such as William S. Burroughs and Henry Miller. Gibson was not doing well in school and his mother was frustrated. She threatened to send him to a boarding school. She was very surprised when he liked this idea very much.

Gibson's mother died when he was eighteen years old. He left school and did not graduate. He traveled a lot. He became very interested in the counterculture. He left the United States and moved to Canada during the Vietnam War draft.

Gibson finished a graduate degree about science fiction. He stopped writing for one year. He did not like the trends he saw in SF. He was more interested in punk rock. He met other writers such as Bruce Sterling, Lewis Shiner, and Rudy Rucker. These writers became the important members of the cyberpunk movement in SF.

Gibson's first published short story was "Fragments of a Hologram Rose" (1977). He wrote other short stories for magazines such as Omni. He was often compared to J. G. Ballard. Some of the characters and places in his short stories are also in his Sprawl novels.

Terry Carr asked Gibson to write "Neuromancer" for the second series of Ace Science Fiction Specials. The purpose of the series was to give attention to first-time novelists.

"Neuromancer" was a success and Gibson kept writing SF. "The Sprawl trilogy" continued the story of Neuromancer, even though Gibson did not plan to write any sequels. Then he explored other ideas. "The Difference Engine" was alternate history. In "The Bridge trilogy", Gibson wrote about new problems. He paid less attention to large corporations or artificial intelligence. He wrote more about mass media and celebrity.

Gibson's novels "Pattern Recognition" (2003), "Spook Country" (2007) and "Zero History" (2010) happen in the same contemporary universe — "more or less the same one we live in now" 

He has written short stories and novels with others, especially other cyberpunk authors John Shirley and Bruce Sterling.

There have been many attempts to make films based on Gibson's writing. Most of these have never been completed.
Gibson has written poems too. He has also worked with artists, architects, and musicians.

In 1990, Gibson was part of an exhibit at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art called "Visionary San Francisco". He wrote a short story, "Skinner's Room", that took place in San Francisco. In the story, the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge was closed and became a community for homeless people. Architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts were interested in the story and imagined a future San Francisco. Their idea of the future showed rich people living in high-tech towers above a city that was falling apart. Gibson was part of the architects' exhibit. Visitors could watch a video of him discussing the future and reading from the story "Skinner's Room". Another version of the short story appeared a year later in "Omni magazine".

In 1993, Gibson wrote some lyrics for the album "Technodon" by the Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra. He was the vocalist on the track ""Hi-Tech Hippies"". He wrote lyrics to the track ""Dog Star Girl"" on Deborah Harry's "Debravation".

Gibson sometimes writes nonfiction for newspapers or magazines. He has written essays, opinion-editorials, and commentary for publications such as: "Wired", "The New York Times", "The Observer", "Addicted to Noise", "New York Times Magazine", "Rolling Stone", and "Details Magazine".

In his fiction and non-fiction, Gibson often writes about cities. He thinks many cities are losing variety. One way of describing this is "Disneylanding".
Many writers believe that Gibson helped science fiction become cool.

Easter Island

Easter Island is a Polynesian island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean. The capital city is Hanga Roa.

It is famous for its 887 huge statues called Moai, made by the early Rapa Nui people. Easter Island also has a huge crater called Rano Kau at the edge of the island. In the crater there is a natural lake, one of only three bodies of fresh water on the island.

Easter Island a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Much of the island is protected in the Rapa Nui National Park.

The introduction of diseases carried by European colonizers and slave raiding devastated the population in the 1800s. Introduced animals, first rats and then sheep, were largely responsible for the island's loss of native flora.

The history of Easter Island is rich and controversial. Its inhabitants have suffered famines, civil war, slave raids, and near total loss of forests. The population has declined steeply more than once. The islanders have left a cultural legacy that is famous.

300–400 AD was thought to be the date of the first settlement of Easter Island, which is about the same time as the arrival of the first settlers on Hawaii. However, new results in radiocarbon dating show that Polynesia and Rapa Nui were settled between 700 to 1,100 AD.

The island was most probably settled by Polynesians who navigated in canoes or catamarans from the Marquesas Islands, 3,200 km (2,000 miles) away, or the Gambier Islands (Mangareva, 2,600 km (1,600 miles) away. When Captain Cook visited the island, one of his crew members, who was a Polynesian from Bora Bora, was able to communicate with the Rapa Nui.

According to oral traditions written down by missionaries in the 1860s, the island originally had a very clear class system, with an ariki, high chief, who had great power over nine other clans and their chiefs.
A French navigator, Jean-Francois de Galaup, comte de La Perouse, found 2,000 people on the island when he arrived in 1786. A major slave raid from Peru in 1862, followed by epidemics of smallpox, reduced the population to only 111 people by 1877. By that time, Catholic missionaries had settled on Easter Island and begun to convert the population to Christianity, a process that was completed by the late 19th century. In 1888, Chile annexed Easter Island, leasing much of the land for sheep raising. The Chilean government appointed a civilian governor for Easter Island in 1965, and the island’s residents became full Chilean citizens.

The high chief was the eldest descendent, through firstborn lines, of the island's legendary founder, Hotu Matu'a. The most visible part of the culture was the making of very large statues called moai that represented deified ancestors. It was believed that the living had a relationship with the dead where the dead provided everything the living needed. Most settlements were on the coast and moai were erected all along the coastline, watching over their descendants in the settlements before them, with their backs toward the spirit world in the sea.

The most important myths are:

The climate of Easter Island is subtropical maritime. The lowest temperatures are in July and August (18 °C) and the highest in February (maximum temperature 28 °C), the summer season in the southern hemisphere. Winters are quite mild. The rainiest month is April, though the island has year-round rainfall.

Appin, New South Wales

Appin is a town in New South Wales, Australia in Wollondilly Shire. It is situated about 16 kilometres south of Campbelltown and 35 kilometres north west of Wollongong. In 2006, there were 1,423 people living in Appin. The fifth village settled in Australia, it is now on the fringe of the Sydney urban area.

The town was named by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1811 after a small village on the coast of Scotland where his wife was born. One of the first settlers was John Hume, whose son Hamilton Hume became a famous Australian explorer. Hamilton Hume explored the local area and was given a grant of 300 acres of land at Appin as a reward. When he made his famous journey to Victoria with William Hovell in 1824, they started the journey from Appin.

Appin is the birthplace of John Fuller (1830-1865), the Australian bushranger also known as Dan Morgan.

Cataract Gorge is about 10 km south east of Appin. It is now has a dam built in 1906 which is the oldest dam in the Sydney water supply system. On 17 April 1816, the British army killed many Aboriginal men, women and children, of the Dharawal Nation at the gorge. They had been fighting the European settlers who were moving into the area.

The Roman Catholic church at Appin, St. Bede's, was built from 1837-1843. The design was by Father John Therry (1790-1864), who became Australia's first Catholic priest in 1820. St. Bede's is the oldest Catholic church still in continuous use. It was named after St. Bede, the founder of the Benedictines.

Constable

A constable is a person doing a certain job, most commonly in law enforcement. The work and role of a constable can vary a lot in different countries.

Historically, the word "constable" comes from the Latin, "comes stabuli", count of the stables. It came from the Eastern Roman Empire. Originally, the constable was the person who kept the horses of a lord or monarch. The title was later used in the monarchies of medieval Europe. In many countries, the constable became a high military rank and great officer of State such as, the Constable of France.

In modern times, constables are law enforcement officers. In the United Kingdom, Commonwealth of Nations and some European countries, a constable is the lowest rank of police officer. In the United States a constable is usually an elected peace officer, with less powers than a sheriff. However, in the Channel Islands a constable is an elected office-holder at the parish level.

Historically, a constable could also be someone in charge of the defence of a castle. Even today, there is a Constable of the Tower of London.

It is a similar position to Marshal, which comes from Old High German "marah" "horse" and "schalh" "servant", and originally meant "stable keeper", which has a similar etymology.

Monaro (New South Wales)

Monaro (pronounced "mon-air'-ro") is the name of a region in the south of New South Wales, Australia. It also includes a small area of Victoria near Snowy River National Park. The Australian Capital Territory is often considered part of the region. Most towns in the region have very close links with Canberra.

The Monaro region is a large plateau about above sea level. It lies between the valley of the Murrumbidgee River in the north, and the Errinundra Plateau in the south. It drops steeply to the coast on its eastern side. Much of the region is an ancient highland, but there is basaltic bedrock near Cooma and Nimmitabel. This produces the only true chernozems in Australia. These are some of the best soils in the whole country. Elsewhere on the Monaro the granitic soils are very infertile. They supported dry forest vegetation before clearing for farming.

Because it is located east of the Snowy Mountains, the rain-bearing westerly winds drop rain and snow on the mountains leaving the Monaro region in a rain shadow. Annual rainfall ranges from around Dalgety to at the eastern edge of the plateau. Occasional storms can produce very heavy rainfall. On one day in June 1975, Nimmitabel received of rain. Temperatures in summer are warm to very warm. The average maximum temperatures range from around Canberra and Queanbeyan to on the highest parts of the plateau. Nights in summer can be cool, but in winter the region is the coldest part of mainland Australia outside the Alps The with July minimum temperatures averaging in Canberra and in Bombala.

The Monaro region features rolling hills that rise to very rugged peaks in the Tinderry Mountains. There are shallow valleys in the upper Murrumbidgee. The basaltic Monaro Range separates the Snowy and Murrumbidgee drainages. Because the climate in the basaltic areas is too cold for crops, the main industry is raising sheep and beef cattle.

The Monaro Highway is the main State highway from Canberra to the Monaro region. The main towns in the region are Cooma and Bombala, others include Berridale, Adaminaby, Delegate, Dalgety, Nimmitabel and Jindabyne.

The Halifax continued to grow and in 1999 the Halifax bought out the Birmingham Midshires Building Society and Comparetheloan. In 1999 the Halifax set up Intelligent Finance', which was a telephone based bank.

In 2001 the Halifax merged with the Bank of Scotland and formed Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS). Both brands were kept although some Halifax branches in Scotland became 'Bank of Scotland' and Bank of Scotland branches in Ireland became 'Halifax' branches. This was done because the Bank of Scotland was much larger in Scotland than the Halifax, while Halifax was much larger in Ireland than the Bank of Scotland and had spent a lot of money advertising of Irish television.

In January 2009 HBOS was acquired by Lloyds TSB which subsequently became Lloyds Banking Group. The Halifax is now just a brand name used by this group.

The bank has its main offices in Halifax town centre. It also has other major offices in Copley (near Halifax) and Leeds The Leeds offices used to belong to the Leeds Permanent Building Society. There are also offices in Aylesbury, Nottingham and Buckinghamshire.

Now that the Halifax is part of Lloyds Banking Group there are also many former Lloyds, Bank of Scotland and TSB offices. Some services have been centralised, leading to job losses at some offices.

It was announced on June 30th 2010 that the Nottingham office is to close at the end of 2011. It has been confirmed by banking officials from Lloyds that a total of 198 jobs will be lost as a result.

The Halifax has branches all over the United Kingdom and also has 44 in Ireland (although these are to close). Many Halifax branches used to belong to the Leeds Permanent Building Society, which was taken-over by the Halifax in 1995.

Landlord

A landlord is a kind of businessperson or company who owns buildings or land, and earns money by charging rent to people (tenants) who want to use them. The word originated in the Middle Ages because a person who owned land then was also its lord who was in charge of the local government. Many natural persons who are landlords use borrowed money to buy their real estate and depend on enough tenants paying their rent on time, more for the purpose of reducing the amount of money they owe on the property than to provide them with an income.

Donald Trump is an example of a well known modern landlord.

It is best known for its engineering design work. Projects it has helped with include the Sydney Opera House, the Pompidou Centre, the Oresund Bridge, the Seattle Library, the new De Young Museum, the HSBC headquarters in Hong Kong, the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and the London Millennium Bridge. 


Brownfield land

Brownfield sites are abandoned or not very used industrial and business places available for re-use. Expansion or redevelopment of such a facility may be difficult by real or possible environmental contaminations. 

In the United States city planning language, a brownfield site (or simply a brownfield) is land previously used for industrial purposes or certain business uses. The land may be contaminated by low amounts of hazardous waste or pollution. It has the potential to be reused once it is cleaned up. Land that is more severely contaminated and has high levels of hazardous waste or pollution, such as a Superfund site, does not fall under the brownfield classification. "Mothballed brownfields" are properties which the owners are not willing to transfer or put to productive reuse.

In the United Kingdom and Australia, the term applies more generally to previously used land.

Manchester Velodrome

Manchester Velodrome is an indoor cycle-racing track (or velodrome) in Manchester, in the north west of England. It opened in September 1994 and is the United Kingdom's leading indoor Olympic-standard track. Today it is home to the National Cycling Centre, and the headquarters of British Cycling, the national governing body. It is open to the public.

It hosted the track cycling in the 2002 Commonwealth Games, and the UCI world championships in 1996, 2000 and 2008.

The track has a reputation for speed. By 30 March 2008, more than 15 world records had been set there. The records include Chris Boardman's 1996 and 2000 hour records and the 4000 metre team pursuit record set by the Great Britain men's team at the 2008 World Championships.

The track is 250 metres long. Its bankings reach 42 degrees in the middle. The track is as steep at the top as it is on the black (racing) line. On 21 May 2007 the velodrome closed to be re-surfaced. The old track was relaid with Siberian pine. It reopened on 16 July 2007, and is now considered smoother to ride.

The Revolution Series was introduced in 2003 to make track cycling more popular. Its goal was to try and build on the success of the well attended events like the World Championships and World Cup Classics Meetings. It was also to provide more regular events for fans to go to. The series started with 4 events over the winter season and quickly built up good regular crowds. The first close to sell out crowd came at the 7th meeting, in 2005, when all seats were sold with a further number of fans standing. The first official complete sell out came at Revolution 14 and is now a regular occurrence.

Alongside the senior racing, the Future Stars competition also runs at each Revolution event. This series involves young riders, usually 15-16 year olds, and puts them through a number of races each night to test both their sprint and endurance skills.

An incomplete list of events which Manchester Velodrome has hosted:

The velodrome is not just solely for the use of professional riders. Cycling fans can also have the opportunity of riding around the famous boards as well. Regular sessions are run every week at the velodrome, starting from taster sessions right up to serious training. A taster session involves some basic training and an hour riding the track.

On 2 July 2009 cycling fans Kraftwerk performed at the Manchester Velodrome as part of the 2009 Manchester International Festival. During the performance of the song Tour de France, four members of the British Olympic Cycling Team entered the velodrome and cycled circuits.


2012 United States presidential election

The 2012 United States presidential election happened on November 6, 2012. Barack Obama, the incumbent president and Democratic candidate, won the election. He defeated Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate, who was the former Governor of Massachusetts. There were also elections for the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. 

By November 6, 2012, 11:30 PM ET (5:30 AM UTC), many broadcast networks said that Obama and Biden won the election. Mitt Romney of the Republican Party conceded the election to Obama around 1 AM ET on November 7. Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party came in third.

Between the 2008 and 2012 elections the Electoral College changed because of the 2010 Census. As a result, several states have lost electoral votes, and several states have gained electoral votes. Here are the states that have gained or lost electoral votes:
Gained votes

Lost votes

The Republicans held their national convention from August 27 to August 30, 2012 at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, Florida. The Democrats held their convention from September 3 to September 6, 2012 at the Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Barack Obama declared that he was running for re-election in 2012 on April 4, 2011. He had challengers in 7 states, but still managed to win all 57 democratic primaries and therefore the democratic nomination.


In the middle of 2011, there were many Republicans running: Minnesota congresswoman Michelle Bachmann, Businessman Herman Cain, Speaker of the House of Representatives (in the 1990s) Newt Gingrich, Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Ambassador to China and Governor of Utah Jon Huntsman, Texas Governor Rick Perry, Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, Buddy Roemer, Thaddeus McCotter, and Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty.

Scott Brown, Sarah Palin, Chris Christie, Donald Trump, Mike Huckabee, and Rudy Giuliani were considered possible candidates. All of them said that they were not going to run for president.

In May, a series of debates began between the Republicans. 
In August 2011, the Ames Straw Poll was conducted. It was won by Bachmann, with Paul coming in second. During the poll, Perry entered the race. After not placing in the top 2 in the poll, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty dropped out. Thaddeus McCotter dropped out a short time later.

Rick Perry became the frontrunner (person with the highest amount of support who is expected to win, according to polls) of the party, ahead of Romney in the polls. Rick Perry then had several bad debates and in one of them, he said he wanted to remove 3 government departments, but forgot one of them. After these mistakes, Perry's poll numbers went down.
In the fall, Herman Cain became the new frontrunner for several months. He had an economic plan called 9-9-9 that would replace the entire tax system with a 9% income tax, a 9% national sales tax, and a 9% corporation tax. During foreign policy debates, he was not as successful. On December 3, 2011, Cain left the Presidential race. This was after several women said that he had sexually harassed them.

Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney were the two main competitors after that, but soon after Newt Gingrich lost much of his support. Gary Johnson withdrew on December 28, 2011, to run for the nomination of the Libertarian Party.

In January 2012, after not doing well in the primaries, Bachmann, Huntsman, and Perry dropped out of the Presidential race. Rick Santorum, however, picked up a surprise win in Iowa, as did Gingrich in South Carolina.

For February, March, and the beginning of April, Rick Santorum was Mitt Romney's main competitor. On April 10, However, with only 11 (primary) victories to Romney's 23, Rick Santorum announced that he was going to drop out of the race. Buddy Roemer dropped out on February 22nd to run for the nominations of americans elect and the reform party, before ending his campaign completely on May 31.

After Santorum dropped out, most people thought that Mitt Romney would win the most primaries, and therefore the most pledged delegates, and ultimately the nomination. His two remaining opponents, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul decided to stay in the race. Gingrich dropped out on May 2 after a disappointing showing in the Delaware primary that left his number of victories at 2 to Romney's 28. Paul, despite having only 1 victory to Romney's eventual 42 victories, did not end his campaign until after the 2012 republican national convention.

Santorum and Gingrich released their delegates ahead of the convention to vote for Romney.

At the republican national convention, with support from many pledged and unpledged delegates, Romney won the nomination in a landslide. The convention chose Paul Ryan as Romney's running mate.

Other candidates for nomination included Virgil Goode, Roseanne Barr, Rocky Anderson, and Tom Hoefling.

Four other parties nominated candidates that had ballot access or write-in access to at least 270 electoral votes, the minimum number of votes needed in the 2012 election to win the presidency through a majority of the electoral college.




Many polls have been taken about the presidential election. Most polls show Obama beating Romney, aside from polls taken between the first and second presidential debates. In polls taken state-by-state, Obama usually wins states he won in 2008, and Republicans usually win states that McCain won in 2008. Indiana, North Carolina, and Nebraska's second congressional district are the main exceptions to the rule.

Popular vote count is preliminary, and does not include all precincts.

When you read "Consensus", it means that many news programs have said they believe Obama/Romney will win a particular state. A projection is when someone expresses their belief in something, in this case about the outcome of the election. An EV is an Electoral vote, from the Electoral college.

Note: Florida was not called until November 10 due to an extremely close race.

The Kippax

The Kippax was one of the most well known stands at Manchester City's Maine Road Ground. Originally the Popular Stand, its name was changed in 1957. The Kippax was unusual in that unlike in most other grounds, this area of support occupied a full side rather than an end of the ground. In 1994, due to the Taylor Report, the new redeveloped, all seater stand was opened by City legend Bert Trautmann. It housed 10,000 fans and had three levels. At the time it was the highest stand in the country.

The club left the Maine Road ground in 2003 and moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium.. This of course bought the end for one of the City's most loved stands, The Kippax. Unofficially, the East stand in the new stadium is also named Kippax.


UEFA Women's Euro 2005

The 2005 UEFA Women's Championship, also called WOMEN'S EURO 2005 (trademark of UEFA), was a football tournament for women held from 5 June to 19 June 2005 in Lancashire, England. The UEFA Women's Championship is a regular tournament involving European national teams from countries that are part of UEFA, the European governing body, who have qualified for the competition. The competition tries to determine which national women's team is the best in Europe.

Germany won the competition for the fourth consecutive tournament. It was the sixth time overall (including one win in the predecessor tournament, the "European Competition for Representative Women's Teams") that they won. Their championship win was the last for coach Tina Theune-Meyer, who months earlier had announced that she would retire at the end of the tournament. In her nine years in charge of Germany, they won three European titles, two bronze medals in the Olympics, and the 2003 World Cup.

Eight national teams participated–seven which qualified from earlier stages, plus England, which received an automatic berth as the host nation. They were split into two groups of 4: Group A and Group B. Each team in a group played each other once, with the top two teams in each group moving into the semi-finals. The winner faced the runner-up of the other group in a play-off, with the winner of each semi-final advancing to the final to determine the champion.



A qualifying round ran from 22 March to 3 October 2004 . The teams which were entered played in a group stage, with the winners advancing to the final, and the runners-up being given the chance of qualification through a play-off. England, as the host nation, qualified automatically for the tournament.

The following teams were eliminated at this stage :


Three teams were also eliminated in play-offs for the tournament:

Public health

Public health is the science dealing with prevention there is a disease that is a threat to the overall health of a community, as well as with prolonging life and promoting health. The aims are achieved through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, public and private organizations, communities and individuals. 

It bases on health analysis of a handful of people or all the inhabitants of several continents rather than on an individual. Public health includes such parts as epidemiology, biostatistics, health services, environmental, social, behavioral, and occupational health. 

Public health intervention prevents rather than treats a disease through surveillance of cases and promotes healthy behaviors such as hand washing, vaccination programs and distribution of condoms. In outbreaks of an infectious disease, treating a disease may be vital to preventing it in others. 

Most countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. Many diseases are preventable through simple, non-medical methods. Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in the developing world and in developed countries, through local health systems and through international non-governmental organizations. In the developing world, there may not be enough trained health workers or monetary resources to provide a basic level of medical care and disease prevention. 

Public health has roots in antiquity. From the beginning, human civilization recognized that polluted water and lack of proper waste disposal spread communicable diseases. Early religions attempted to regulate behavior related to health, from types of food eaten, to behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or sexual relationships. Governments placed responsibility on leaders to develop public health policies and programs in order to gain some understanding of the causes of disease, ensure social stability prosperity, and maintain order. 

The Chinese developed the practice of variolation following a smallpox epidemic around 1000 BC. The practice of vaccination did not become prevalent until the 1820s. During the 14th century Black Death in Europe, burning parts of cities resulted in benefit, since it destroyed the rodent infestations. The development of quarantine in the medieval period restricted effects of other infectious diseases. 

Later they started build of sewers, the regular collection of garbage, incineration or disposal, providing clean water and draining standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitos. The industrial revolution initially caused the spread of disease through large conurbations around workhouses and factories.

The increase in average life span in the 20th century is credited to public health achievements, such as vaccination programs and control of infectious diseases, effective safety policies of motor vehicle and occupational safety, improved family planning, chlorination of drinking water, smoke-free measures, and programs on decreasing chronic disease such as cancer, heart disease and more physical exercise.

Sometimes, the developing world is plagued by largely preventable infectious diseases, due to malnutrition and poverty. The focus of public health has moved from individual behaviors and risk factors to population-level issues such as inequality, poverty, and education. There is recognition that our health is affected by where we live, genetics, our income, our educational status and our social relationships.

Public health in England is mostly run by local government since 2012. They pay for 


Schools of public health offer: 

Most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. In recent years, public health programs providing vaccinations have made strides in promoting health, including the eradication of smallpox. 

An important public health issues facing the world currently are HIV/AIDS, antibiotic resistance, leading to the re-emergence of diseases such as Tuberculosis, diabetes. As non-communicable diseases caused by smoking have been threatening public health, public health started controlling smoking. The global health system needs to find a way to even out communicable and non communicable diseases. Many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places.

Epidemiology

Epidemiology is the study of the health and illness of populations. The three levels of causation of health problems include individual behavioral level, individual biological level, and political-economic ecological level. 
Epidemiologists aim to understand the causes of health problems by looking at the relationship between agents, hosts, and environmental factors that affect health. Using these information, they also design public health interventions to solve various health problems in populations. They regularly evaluate the health of populations, try to identify which populations have greater risk from specific causes of diseases, and evaluate the intervention programs or methods that they create. Epidemiology is the foundation of public health and preventative medicine practices.
There are two types of epidemiology: descriptive and analytic. Descriptive epidemiology aims to describe the distribution of people who gets sick (compared with those who don't) with regards to time, place, and person (TPP). It can be thought of as answering the questions of when, who, and what respectively. It investigates when a health issue or disease first emerged in a population, who in the population are getting sick, and where the disease/health condition seems to have started and spread from. Analytic epidemiology then uses the data provided by TPP to make and test hypothesis which aim to determine the cause of an outbreak or disease cluster in a population. Epidemiologists evaluate morbidity (people who are sick or injured) and mortality to understand the burden of disease among populations.
Surveillance studies provide the numerical data and statistics that epidemiologists use. Surveillance studies are done to monitor the health of populations and help with identifying any new health problems or disease that may develop, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of existing health intervention measures in place. These studies also rely on TPP to collect data and present it in simple graphs and tables which are easy to summarize and understand. These studies are especially important in helping guide policy making decisions and helping epidemiologists understand which interventions work and which don't. It is also important for donors as they rely on surveillance data to analyze the usefulness of their investments and whether it is being used effectively or not.
Epidemiology means "the study of what is upon the people". The word derived from the Greek terms "epi" = upon, among; "demos" = people, district; "logos" = study, word, discourse. It applies only to human populations. But the term is used in studies of zoological populations 'epizoology', and plant populations.

Hippocrates was the first who looked at the relationships between disease and environmental influences. He drew the distinction between 'epidemic' and 'endemic': diseases that are 'visited upon' a population (epidemic) as contrasted with those that 'live within' a population (endemic).

The Persian physician Avicenna in the 1020s, discovered the contagious nature of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted disease. He noted the distribution of disease through water and soil. Avicenna said that bodily secretion is contaminated by foul foreign earthly bodies before being infected. He introduced the method of quarantine to limit the spread of contagious disease.
The Black Death (bubonic plague) reached Al Andalus in the 14th century. Ibn Khatima thought infectious diseases were caused by "minute bodies" which enter the human body and cause disease. Another Andalusian-Arabian physician, Ibn al-Khatib (1313–1374) in his treatise "On the Plague" stated how infectious disease can be transmitted through bodily contact and "through garments, vessels and earrings". Girolamo Fracastoro from Verona suggested these very small, unseeable, particles that cause disease were alive. They were able to spread by air, and multiply. They could be destroyed by fire. He refuted Galen's miasma theory (poison gas in sick people). In 1543, Fracastoro's book "De contagione et contagiosis morbis" suggested personal and environmental hygiene to prevent disease. The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by Anton van Leeuwenhoek in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a germ theory of disease.
In 1662 John Graunt analysed the mortality rolls in London before the Great Plague. This gave statistical evidence for and against various theories of disease.

Dr. John Snow investigated the causes of the 19th Century Cholera epidemics. He noticed the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Water Company. He showed the Broad Street pump was the origin of the Soho epidemic, a classic example of epidemiology He used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and had the pump handle removed. This stopped the outbreak. It was a major event in the history of public health, and the founding event of the science of epidemiology.
The term 'epidemiology' was first used in 1802 by the Spanish physician Villalba. 

In 1847 Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis brought down infant mortality at a Vienna hospital by disinfection. Unfortunately, disinfection did not become widely practiced until British surgeon Joseph Lister 'discovered' antiseptics in 1865 after Louis Pasteur's work. 

In the early 20th century, mathematical methods were introduced into epidemiology by Ronald Ross and others. In 1954 came the results of a study led by Richard Doll. This gave very strong statistical support to the suspicion that tobacco smoking was linked to lung cancer.

There are several very key terms that epidemiologists use when discussing population health and disease outbreaks. Some of the key concepts that are important to understand when discussing epidemiology:

It is important to note that an endemic disease or cluster can become an epidemic. An example of this would be malaria; although malaria is endemic to certain regions in South America, Africa, and South Asia, during certain years or times it can become an epidemic with higher number of cases then usual present in the population. In addition, it is also possible for an epidemic or outbreak to progress and become a full-fledged pandemic.

Rates refers to the number of cases occurring during a specific period of time and depends on the population size at that time. Calculating disease rates helps epidemiologists to compare health issues among different populations. The general calculation for determining disease rate is to divide the number of cases or health condition by the number of population at risk during a specific period of time, and multiplying that by 100. However, disease rates can also be differentiated into two different types: prevalence rate and incidence rate.

Prevalence rate refers to the number of both old and new cases in a population during a specific time period, which is divided by the total number of cases in the population. Prevalence rates are useful when dealing with investigations relating to chronic diseases, which last for more than 3 months. Incidence rate refers to the number of new health related conditions or cases which is divided by the population at risk. Incidence rates are important in studies involving acute diseases, where symptoms of a disease peak and subside within days or weeks and generally lasts less than 3 months.

Epidemiological studies makes use of both experimental and observational studies.
Experimental studies are ones where the epidemiologist can control and manipulate different variables throughout the experiment. It usually involves a placebo treatment/group. This type of study is used when epidemiologists are trying to determine the cause of a health issue/disease or evaluating the effectiveness of a cure or interventions. 
Observational studies include descriptive and analytical studies; descriptive studies investigate epidemiological cases with regards to TPP while analytical study investigates hypothesis regarding relationships between health issues and risk factors. While descriptive studies answer questions of when, who, and where, analytical studies try to answer the question of how a population is affected by a disease and why they are affected. Observational studies do not manipulate any variables and often uses comparison groups for analysis. This type of study is often done in an attempt to discover the links between exposure to certain risk factors and health outcomes. Some examples of observational studies include cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies.

Investigating an outbreak is a very involved multi-step process which ranges from first establishing the existence of an outbreak to communicating the findings of the investigation with the scientific community as well as the general population. The following is a rough sequence of the process of these investigations.


Epidemiology is a multidisciplinary subject. It includes public health care workers and scientists from fields such as chemists, biologists, geneticists, and anthropologists. They may work in hospital and research settings, as well as for government organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Epidemic Intelligence Service is a subgroup within the CDC specializing in epidemiology. Epidemic Intelligence Service officers are field workers who investigate outbreaks in the US and other countries. Their work aids in understanding causes of outbreaks and quickly stopping spread of diseases from one place to another; notably, they have contributed to helping during various pandemics in the past, such as with smallpox, polio, and Ebola.

Cultural anthropologists have been a very helpful resource in bridging the gap between different countries/cultures and the epidemiological investigators. They help with the development and implementation of preventative/control measures in countries in a manner that will not conflict with societal beliefs or values, which may get in the way of treatment or stopping the spread of an outbreak.

Medical anthropology looks at biological, social, cultural, and linguistic anthropology to understand how they influence health and well-being, experience and distribution of illness, as well as prevention of treatment. For example, they investigate how culture affects research studies, are able to pick up on seemingly "irrelevant" yet important small details that an epidemiologist might miss, and they are able to provide qualitative data whereas epidemiology only focuses on quantitative data. Epidemiology has largely ignored cultural factors when looking at the causes of diseases/health conditions. Medical anthropology has contributed to the field by showing how culture and social factors play a big role in people's willingness to follow public health guidelines/interventions or even accept treatment for their illnesses.

Epidemiological investigations may lead to a reductionist or limited point of view, medical anthropology provides a more holistic view of the problem and examines the issue from different angles to best understand and help the populations in need. Another critical contribution of medical anthropology has been with critical qualitative data. It provides rich sources of information on understanding the population's subjective experiences. It provides qualitative data explaining why a particular intervention or treatment may have failed among a particular population. Their main contributions have been helping develop epidemiological surveys by taking into account word choice and the "social suitability" of questions. Medical anthropologists have played a large role in helping locals better understand the objectives of epidemiologists and helped them become more receptive of their investigations. Medical anthropology helps explain health phenomenon and create and test hypothesis relating to such explanations. While epidemiology is good at understanding numerical patterns and biological causes for disease/health conditions, it is unable to fully explain all the factors that underlie certain diseases/health conditions. This is a gap that medical anthropology has been able to pick up on and complement by providing rich qualitative data which looks at health and diseases from a holistic perspective.
Some notable mentions of medical anthropologists who have worked and contributed to epidemiology and public health in general include Dr. Jim Kim and Paul Farmer. Dr. Jim Kim served as the president of the World Bank while Paul Farmer is a physician and medical anthropologist who focuses on infectious diseases and treatment. These men co-founded the Partners in Health program, which provided free health care to the poorest populations in countries like Haiti, Peru, and Rwanda. Other notable mentions are Amber Wutich and Alexandra Brewis. Both are professors and researchers at Arizona State University. They focus on health impacts caused by resource scarcity, specifically relating to lack of access to clean water in developing countries. Wutich is a director of the Global Ethnohydrology study which looks at water knowledge and management in ten countries, while Brewis researches the impact of culture on human biology.

Epidemiological practice and the results of epidemiological analysis make a significant contribution to health management

Modern population-based health management is complex. Epidemiological practice and analysis is a core component. This task requires the forward looking ability to guide how a health system responds to current health issues, and how a health system can respond to future potential population health issues.

Pooper-scooper

A pooper-scooper, or poo scoop, is a device or a ‘poo bag’ used by pet owners to pick up an animal's fecal matter from public places and yards. Such devices often have a bag or bag attachment. The ‘poop bag’ is usually turned inside out, to carry the feces to a proper disposal area. The person performing the cleanup might also be called a pooper-scooper.

Many places have laws telling pet owners to clean up after their pets after the pet has pooped on a sidewalk or any public place, on a floor, wall, stairway or roof of any public or private premises used in common by the public, or on a fence, wall or stairway of a building abutting on a public. There can be fines for failing to do this.

Pet droppings contaminate the environment with bacteria, parasites and stench. The droppings are one of the leading sources of "E. coli" (fecal coliforms) bacterial pollution: one gram of dog feces contains over 20,000,000 "E. coli" cells. Coliform bacteria and "E. coli" are commonly-used field indicators of fecal contamination by animals (including human). Pet droppings contain eggs of Toxocara canis and Neospora caninum parasitic worms. In adult dogs infection with T.canis is usually asymptomatic but can be fatal in puppies. T. canis can cause parasitic worm infection and rarely blindness in humans. N.caninum causes severe losses in livestock breeding. While an individual animal's deposit of feces will not measurably affect the environment, the cumulative effect of thousands of dogs and cats in a metropolitan area creates serious problems due to contamination of soil and water supplies. The runoff from neglected pet waste contaminates water, creates health hazards for people, fish, and animals.

The situation is particularly dire in Germany, where an estimated 1400 tonnes of feces are deposited daily on public property. A citizen commission (2005) overwhelmingly recommended a plan. DNA samples would be required when pet licenses come up for renewal. Within a year, a database of some 12,500 registration-required canine residents would be available to sanitation workers with sample-test kits. Evidence would be submitted to a forensics laboratory where technicians could readily match the waste to its dog. The prospect of a prompt fine equivalent to $600 US (at 2005 exchange rate) would help assure preventive compliance, as well as cover costs.

Daigo Nishi

Nishi was born in Sapporo on August 28, 1987. He joined J2 League club Consadole Sapporo from their youth team in 2006. Although he could hardly play in the match until 2007, Consadole won the champions in 2007 and was promoted to J1 League. In 2008, he became a regular player as right midfielder. However Consadole was finished at the bottom place and was relegated to J2 in a year. In 2009, he was converted to right side back by manager Nobuhiro Ishizaki. In 2010, he moved to J1 club Albirex Niigata and played as side back in 1 season. In 2011, he moved to Kashima Antlers as Atsuto Uchida successor. He played as side back for the club in 8 seasons. In 2016, Antlers won the champions in J1 League and qualified for 2016 Club World Cup as host country champions. At Club World Cup, he played all 4 matches and won the 2nd place. In 2018, Antlers won the champions in the 2018 AFC Champions League. In 2019, he moved to Vissel Kobe. In 2019, Vissel won the champions in the Emperor's Cup which is first major title in the club history. In 2021, he moved to Urawa Reds.

On June 1, 2011, Nishi debuted for the Japan national team against Peru. On March 23, 2019, he played in the match for the first time in 8 years against Bolivia.

Stramenopile

The heterokonts or stramenopiles are a major line of eukaryotes with more than 100,000 known species, most of them diatoms.

Heterokonts are mostly algae. In one stage of their life cycle they have two unequal flagella. They include both single-celled types and brown algae (seaweeds such as kelp and "Sargassum"). They are members of the Kingdom Chromalveolata.

Metastability

Metastability has slightly different meanings in different fields of knowledge. The general idea, however, is that something is metastable if it is not changing, yet given a small force ("nudge") it will transition to another, more stable state. 

For example, a block is sitting on a slope (an "inclined plane"). It keeps sitting there until it is nudged, or the slope is gently struck, setting up vibrations. Then the block starts to slide. At that point it keeps sliding until it reaches the bottom. The block sitting at the bottom is stable. The block sitting on the slope but not moving is metastable. And the block as it is moving is unstable. 

A real life example of this is an avalanche of snow. The avalanche is unstable (the snow is sliding down the mountainside). When the avalanche is over the snow is stable. Before the avalanche starts, the snow is metastable, since some small perturbation is enough to cause it to lose what might have seemed to be stability, but in fact was only metastability.

Cryptomonad

The Cryptomonads (or Cryptophyta) are a phylum of algae, most of which have chloroplasts. 
They are common in freshwater, and also occur in marine and brackish habitats. Each cell is around 10-50 μm in size and flattened in shape, with an anterior groove or pocket. At the edge of the pocket there are typically two slightly unequal flagella.

Some may exhibit mixotrophy, using mixed sources of energy.

Planck constant

The Planck constant (Planck's constant) says how much the energy of a photon increases, when the frequency of its electromagnetic wave increases by 1 (In SI Units). It is named after the physicist Max Planck. The Planck constant is a fundamental physical constant. It is written as h.

The Planck constant has dimensions of physical action: energy multiplied by time, or momentum multiplied by distance. In SI units, the Planck constant is expressed in joule seconds (J⋅s) or (N⋅m⋅s) or (kg⋅m⋅s).
The symbols are defined here.

In SI Units the Planck constant is exactly J·s (by definition). Scientists have used this quantity to calculate measurements like the Planck length and the Planck time.

Planck h=WL= Wb/2P 4C/3X=2WbC/3XP.
Magnetron W=Wb/2P
Electron L=4C/3X = 25e/3 =(13U1d)

Between 1670 and 1900 scientists discussed the nature of light. Some scientists believed that light consisted of many millions of tiny particles. Other scientists believed that light was a wave.

In 1678, Christiaan Huygens wrote the book "Traité de la lumiere" ("Treatise on light"). He believed that light was made up of waves. He said that light could not be made up of particles because light from two beams do not bounce off each other.
In 1672, Isaac Newton wrote the book "Opticks". He believed that light was made up of red, yellow and blue particles which he called corpusles. Newton explained this by his "two prism experiment". The first prism broke light up into different colours. The second prism merged these colours back into white light.

During the 18th century, Newton's theory was given the most attention. In 1803, Thomas Young described the "double-slit experiment". In this experiment, light going through two narrow slits interferes with itself. This causes a pattern which shows that light is made up of waves. For the rest of the nineteenth century, the wave theory of light was given the most attention. In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell developed equations that described electromagnetic radiation as waves.

The theory of electromagnetic radiation treats light, radio waves, microwaves and many other types of wave as the same thing except that they have different wavelengths. The wavelength of the light we can see with our eyes is roughly between 400 and 600 nm. The wavelength of radio waves varies from 10 m to 1500 m and the wavelength of microwaves is about 2 cm. In a vacuum, all electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave is given by:

The symbols are defined here.

All warm things give off thermal radiation, which is electromagnetic radiation. For most things on Earth this radiation is in the infra-red range, but something very hot (1000 °C or more), gives off visible radiation, that is, light. In the late 1800's many scientists studied the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation from black-body radiators at different temperatures.

Lord Rayleigh first published the basics of the Rayleigh-Jeans law in 1900. The theory was based on the Kinetic theory of gasses. Sir James Jeans published a more complete theory in 1905. The law relates the quantity and wavelength of electromagnetic energy given off by a black body radiator at different temperatures. The equation describing this is: 

For long-wavelength radiation, the results predicted by this equation corresponded well with practical results obtained in a laboratory. However, for short wavelengths (ultraviolet light) the difference between theory and practice were so large that it earned the nickname "the ultra-violet catastrophe".

in 1895 Wien published the results of his studies into the radiation from a black body. His formula was:

This formula worked well for short wavelength electromagnetic radiation, but did not work well with long wavelengths.

In 1900 Max Planck published the results of his studies. He tried to develop an expression for black-body radiation expressed in terms of wavelength by assuming that radiation consisted of small quanta and then to see what happened if the quanta were made infinitely small. (This is a standard mathematical approach). The expression was:

If the wavelength of light is allowed to become very large, then it can be shown that the Raleigh-Jeans and the Planck relationships are almost identical.

He calculated "h" and "k" and found that

The values are close to the modern day accepted values of and respectively. The Planck law agrees well with the experimental data, but its full significance was only appreciated several years later.

It turns out that electrons are dislodged by the photoelectric effect if light reaches a threshold frequency. Below this no electrons can be emitted from the metal. In 1905 Albert Einstein published a paper explaining the effect. Einstein proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but rather a collection of discrete wave packets (photons), each with energy. Einstein said that the effect was due to a photon striking an electron. This demonstrated the particle nature of light.

Einstein also found that electromagnetic radiation with a long wavelength had no effect. Einstein said that this was because the "particles" did not have enough energy to disturb the electrons.

Planck suggested that the energy of each photon was related to the photon frequency by the Planck constant. This could be written mathematically as:

Planck received the Nobel Prize in 1918 in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta. In 1921 Einstein received the Nobel Prize for linking the Planck constant to the photoelectric effect.

The Planck constant is of importance in many applications. A few are listed below.
In 1913 Niels Bohr published the Bohr model of the structure of an atom. Bohr said that the angular momentum of the electrons going around the nucleus can only have certain values. These values are given by the equation

where

The Bohr model of the atom can be used to calculate the energy of electrons at each level. Electrons will normally fill up the lowest numbered states of an atom. If the atom receives energy from, for example, an electric current, electrons will be excited into a higher state. The electrons will then drop back to a lower state and will lose their extra energy by giving off a photon. Because the energy levels have specific values, the photons will have specific energy levels. Light emitted in this way can be split into different colours using a prism. Each element has its own pattern. The pattern for neon is shown alongside.

In 1927 Werner Heisenberg published the uncertainty principle. The principle states that it is not possible to make a measurement without disturbing the thing being measured. It also puts a limit on the minimum disturbance caused by making a measurement.

In the macroscopic world these disturbances make very little difference. For example, if the temperature of a flask of liquid is measured, the thermometer will absorb a small amount of energy as it heats up. This will cause a small error in the final reading, but this error is small and not important.

In quantum mechanics things are different. Some measurements are made by looking at the pattern of scattered photons. One such example is Compton scattering. If both the position and momentum of a particle is being measured, the uncertainty principle states that there is a trade-off between the accuracy with which the momentum is measured and the accuracy with which the position is measured. The equation that describes this trade-off is: 
where

In the electric circuit shown on the right, the voltage drop across the light emitting diode (LED) depends on the material of the LED. For silicon diodes the drop is 0.6 V. However for LEDs it is between 1.8 V and 2.7 V. This information enables a user to calculate the Planck constant.

The energy needed for one electron to jump the potential barrier in the LED material is given by 
where

When the electron decays back again, it emits one photon of light. The energy of the photon is given by
the same equation used in the photoelectric effect. If these equations are combined, the wavelength of light and the voltage are related by

The table below can be calculated from this relationship.

Since its discovery, measurements of h have become much better. Planck first quoted the value of h to be erg·sec. This value is within 5% of the current value.

As of 3 March 2014, the best measurements of h in SI units is  J·s. The equivalent figure in cgs units is  erg·sec. The relative uncertainty of h is .

The reduced Planck constant (ħ) is a value that is sometimes used in quantum mechanics. It is defined by

Planck units are sometimes used in quantum mechanics instead of SI. In this system the reduced Planck constant has a value of 1, so the value of the Planck constant is 2π.
Plancks constant can now be measured with very high precision. This has caused the BIPM to consider a new definition for the kilogram. The international prototype kilogram is no longer used to define the kilogram. Instead the BIPM defines the Planck constant to have an exact value. Scientists use this value and the definitions of the metre and the second to define the kilogram.

The Planck constant can also be mathematically derived:

formula_11

Here, formula_12 is the permeability of free space, formula_13 is the speed of light, formula_14 is the electric charge of electron, formula_15 is the Bohr's radius, and formula_16 is the frequency of revolution of the electron in a hydrogen atom formula_17. When these constant values are substituted to the theoretical Planck constant, the theoretical Planck constant value is exactly equal to the experimental value.
The Planck's constant elementary formula in terms of proton-to-electron mass ratio, the charge of electron, speed of light and vacuum permittivity is derived in. It is expressed as follows:

formula_18

where formula_19 is the elementary charge of an electron, formula_20 the mass of a proton, formula_21the mass of an electron, formula_22 the vacuum permittivity, and formula_13 the speed of light.


Sebastian Coe

Sebastian Newbold Coe, Baron Coe (born 29 September 1956, and often nicknamed Seb Coe) is a former athlete and politician from the United Kingdom. A middle distance runner, Coe won the 1500 m gold medal at the Olympic Games in 1980 and 1984, and set eight outdoor and three indoor world records. He is widely considered to be amongst the greatest middle distance runners of all time. Following his retirement from athletics, he served as a Member of Parliament for the Conservative Party from 1992-97. He became a life peer in 2000. He is the head of the London bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. After the International Olympic Committee awarded the games to London, he became the chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. In 2007, he was also elected a vice-president of the International Association of Athletics Federations.

Coe was born in Hammersmith, London. He grew up in Warwickshire and Sheffield. His mother, Tina Angela Coe, died in Hammersmith and Fulham, London, in 2005, aged 75. His mother was half Indian, born to a Punjabi father Sardari Lal and an English mother Vera. His father, Peter Coe (born Percy N. Coe in Kingston upon Thames), died on 9 August 2008, aged 88, while Coe was in Beijing.

Coe married Nicky McIrvine, a former Badminton three-day-event champion, in Surrey, in 1990. They have two sons and two daughters, all of whom were born in Surrey:


The marriage ended in divorce in 2002 after twelve years and Coe moved out of the family home. Coe married Carole Annett in summer 2011.

On 12 February 2010, Coe was the 19th runner on the 106th day of the Vancouver Olympic Torch Relay. Coe's leg was along the Stanley Park Seawall, and he exchanged a "torch kiss" with the previous runner, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the next runner, a 19 year old member of the Squamish community.

He was awarded with the first Prince of Asturias Award in sports category in 1987.

Coe was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1982 and an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1990. He was created a life peer in 2000 as Baron Coe, of Ranmore in the County of Surrey.

In December 2005, Coe was given a Special award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards ceremony. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2006 New Year's Honours List for services to sport.




Theme restaurant

Theme restaurants are.restaurants in which the idea for the restaurant takes priority. It influences the architecture, food, music, and overall "feel" of the restaurant. The food usually takes a backseat to the presentation of the theme. These restaurants generally attract customers only because of the theme itself.

One example is the "Rainforest Cafe" restaurants which have the obvious theme of a "Tropical Rainforest". "Medieval Times" has its theme of "Medieval Europe". The "Jekyll & Hyde Club" has an atmosphere of Jack the Ripper and Victorian horror novels. One strange but famous theme restaurant in Berlin, Germany is called "das Klo" (German for "The toilet"). It shows the insides of a toilet.

Many people consider the Rainforest Cafe to be biggest example of a theme restaurant. They also consider it the restaurant which kicked off the theme restaurant trend. Theme restaurants may be experiencing a decline in popularity, given the closings of several Planet Hollywood, Jekyll & Hyde Club, and Wilderness Cafe locations in recent years. Theme restaurants often depend on tourist business, since the theme soon becomes stale to locals. The focus is not necessarily placed on good food and service. Certain tourist destinations such as the Mall of America or Orlando, Florida have better chances of supporting theme restaurants. Theme restaurants are generally common at theme parks, such as Universal Studios.


John Laing plc

John Laing plc is a British developer and operator of privately financed, public sector infrastructure projects such as roads, railways, hospitals and schools. Before being bought by Henderson Private Equity in December 2006, John Laing plc was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was part of the FTSE 250 Index.

The business started in 1848. James Laing (born in 1816), along with his wife Ann Graham, and some employees whom they had hired, built a house on a plot of land that they had bought for £30 in Cumberland. The £150 proceeds from the first house financed the building of the next two houses on the same plot of land. One of these houses was kept by the Laing Family to live in. The family and the business later moved near Carlisle.

When James Laing died in 1882, his son, John Laing (born in 1842) took over the running of the company. John began to take larger contracts but kept the business in the Carlisle area.

John's son, John William Laing, (born in 1879) was working for the business before he was 20 years old, and so it became John Laing and Son. By 1910, John William Laing was running the business. More employees were recruited and larger projects were undertaken, including factory construction.

In 1920 the firm became a limited company, and two years later moved its headquarters from Carlisle to a thirteen acre (5 ha) site at Mill Hill in north-west London.

William Kirby Laing and John Maurice Laing, the fifth generation of the founding family, joined the company in 1950.

John Laing & Sons (Holdings) Ltd was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1952. The family and its trusts and charities held the majority of the shares. John William Laing became the chairman, and his sons became joint managing directors. By this time, the number of employees was around 10,000, and every site had a quality supervisor. John William Laing retired in 1957.

Under William Kirby Laing and James Maurice Laing, the company continued to expand. They gained contracts for power stations. They also worked on road construction while continuing to build houses. In 1985, Martin Laing, of the sixth generation of the founding family, became chairman.

Martin Laing determined that the company should begin to diversify. Home construction in the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Spain, and California was now one of the major sources of the company's growth.

As the company celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1998, it faced falling profits caused by cost overruns on the Millennium project and continuing problems within its construction division, related to competition and overcapacity.

In 1999 John Laing plc purchased a controlling interest in the Chiltern Rail franchise and by 2002 had structured itself into two main divisions, namely Homes and Investments. It underwent yet another change when Sir Martin Laing retired in early 2002. Bill Forrester took over as executive chairman. For the first time in its history Laing did not have a member of the founding family at the head of the company.

The business expanded rapidly in the late 1990s, such that for the year ended 31 December 2001 its turnover was in excess of £1 billion. Following significant losses on certain construction contracts it adopted a new policy of having the PPP / PFI businesses, in which it had been quite successful, as core activities. As a consequence it disposed of its construction division, which was sold to O'Rourke in 2001, its property developments divisions, which were sold to Kier Group, and its house building arm which was sold to George Wimpey in 2002.

In December 2006 John Laing plc was acquired by the Private Equity arm of Henderson Group.

The Laing Rail division - operators of Chiltern Railways and London Overground (with MTR Corporation), and holders of a stake in the open-access railway operator Wrexham & Shropshire - was put up for sale by in September 2007. The division was purchased by German rail operator Deutsche Bahn in January 2008, subject to approval by authorities.

In June 2008 John Laing formed a consortium with Hitachi and Barclays Private Equity called Agility Trains to bid for the contract to design, manufacture, and maintain a fleet of long-distance trains for the Intercity Express Programme. The bid was successful and the contract was awarded to the consortium on the 12 February 2009.

John Laing now has operations in the UK, North America, Europe and Asia.

John Laing’s former construction division, Laing Construction, undertook a number of landmark projects including:

The M1 motorway completed in 1959, Coventry Cathedral completed in 1962, Clifton Cathedral completed in 1973, the Sizewell B nuclear power station completed in 1995, the Second Severn Crossing completed in 1996, the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff completed in 1999 and Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital completed in 2001.

The subsidiary Laing Rail owned and operated Chiltern Railways and was joint operator of London Overground (with MTR Corporation) and Wrexham & Shropshire (with Renaissance Trains). In 2008 Laing Rail was sold to Deutsche Bahn.


Christian Eriksen

Christian Dannemann Eriksen (born 14 February 1992) is a Danish footballer who plays for the English team Manchester United and the Denmark national team as an midfielder. He made his debut for the Denmark national team in March 2010, and was the youngest player of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. 

In 2011, Eriksen was named Danish Football Player of the Year, Dutch Football Talent of the Year, Ajax Talent of the Year (Marco van Basten Award), and made the UEFA Euro U-21 Team of the Tournament. He won the Eredivisie with Ajax in 2010–11, 2011–12, and in 2012–13 before signing with Tottenham Hotspur in August 2013. He won the Tottenham Hotspur Player of the Year award for the 2013–14 season and in 2015, he won the Danish Football Player of the Year award for the second year in a row.

Eriksen started playing football in his hometown Middelfart before his third birthday. In 2005 he switched to Odense Boldklub, who competed in the Danish youth championships. His team lost the semi-final against Brøndby IF, but afterwards he was named "Best Technical Player" of the tournament. The following year OB won the tournament, when Eriksen scored the only goal in the final. After some good performances for OB's U-16 team and later on U-19 team and the Danish U-17 team, major European football clubs including Chelsea and Barcelona began to take notice. The player had trials with Barcelona, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Milan, but finally decided to move to Ajax, stating ""My first step should not be too big. I knew that playing in the Netherlands would be very good for my development. Then Ajax arrived and that was a fantastic option"".

On 17 October 2008 it was announced that Eriksen had signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Amsterdam-based Ajax. The transfer fee received by OB was estimated at €1 million (£847,199). He worked his way through the youth teams, and was promoted to the first team squad in January 2010, where he was given the number 51 shirt. Within the month, he made his first team debut for the Dutch team in the Eredivisie on 17 January 2010 against NAC Breda. Ajax manager Martin Jol compared him to the likes of Ajax youth products Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart and described him as a good reader of the game in the traditional "number 10" role like the two Dutch internationals and Danish legend Michael Laudrup, who also played for Ajax.
On 25 March 2010 he scored his first goal for Ajax in a 6–0 win against opponent Go Ahead Eagles in the Dutch Cup. On 10 April 2010, Eriksen extended his contract with Ajax until the summer of 2014, stating ""I can still learn a lot here, I'm not finished yet and I hope I can mean a lot for the club."" On 6 May 2010, Eriksen played in the second match of the final of the 2009–10 Dutch Cup as Ajax beat Feyenoord 1–4, with 1–6 on aggregate. At the end of his first professional season at Ajax, Eriksen had played 21 competitive matches, scoring one goal, and had made his international debut for Denmark. For his second season in the first team of Ajax, Eriksen was given the number 8 shirt.

Eriksen started the 2010–11 season well, scoring his first Ajax league goal on 29 August 2010 in an away victory over De Graafschap. On 11 November 2010, Eriksen scored his first goal at the Amsterdam ArenA a 3–0 Cup victory over BV Veendam. In December, Eriksen was named Danish "Talent of the Year". Several days after receiving this award, Eriksen once again proved his value to Ajax by scoring the only goal in a 0–1 away league victory over Vitesse. On 17 February 2011, Eriksen scored his first goal in a European tournament, the Ajax goal to 2–0, when Ajax beat Anderlecht 3–0 in the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. On 13 March 2011, Eriksen scored a solo goal, running from the half way line to finish it off with a strike to secure a 3–1 win over Willem II.
During the rest of the season, Eriksen became more and more important for Ajax, due to his growing capabilities as the team's playmaker, providing many assists. After a good season during which he developed himself into an undisputed starter in the side that won the 2010–11 Eredivisie (Ajax's first Eredivisie title in seven years), he was named Ajax's Talent of the Year. On 23 May 2011 he was named Dutch Football Talent of the Year, the second Danish player to win the award since Jon Dahl Tomasson in 1996. He was elected by a jury under command of Holland's all-time best player Johan Cruyff. ""He's a player I really like with all my heart,"" Cruyff praised Eriksen. ""This prize is just the beginning, a stimulus to get the maximum out of his career. The talent is there, the recognition also; now it is up to the player himself. He is a typical product of the Danish school. You can compare him with Brian and Michael Laudrup. Only time will tell if Eriksen can reach the same level as them."".

On 18 October 2011, Eriksen scored his first goal in the UEFA Champions League when Ajax beat Dinamo Zagreb 2–0 in the group stage, making him the 2nd youngest player to score in the 2011–12 season. In the second match versus Dinamo Zagreb on 2 November he provided assists to Gregory van der Wiel and Siem de Jong as well as being involved with the third goal, as Ajax cruised to a 4–0 victory. He was named Danish Football Player of the Year on 7 November after helping Ajax win the Eredivisie the previous year and guiding the national team to a successful Euro 2012 qualification campaign, after receiving the award Eriksen said, ""I am extremely honoured to be standing here tonight. I did not expect it, it really means a lot to me. I would like to thank my team-mates in the national team as well as my team-mates at Ajax"". Following the success of Eriksen's third consecutive Eredivisie title in the 2012–13 season, he opted not to renew his contract with Ajax, and with one year still remaining on his current contract he was permitted to search for a new club. Having come to terms with Tottenham Hotspur in England, Eriksen left Ajax having appeared in 113 league matches, scoring 25 goals and 41 assists. He played in 16 matches for the KNVB Cup, scoring four goals and making four assists. He made 30 appearances on the continental stage for Ajax, scoring three goals, and making 9 assists all together. Having also competed in the Johan Cruijff Shield three years in a row.

On 30 August 2013, Tottenham Hotspur announced that they had completed the transfer of Eriksen from Ajax, in a deal believed to be worth £11 million (€13.5 million), after Eriksen passed a medical at the club. Eriksen joined the club on the same day as Erik Lamela, who joined from Roma, and Vlad Chiricheș, who joined from Steaua București, and took the club's total spending for the 2013 summer transfer window to £109.5 million.

On 14 September 2013, he made his Premier League debut against Norwich City, providing an assist for Gylfi Sigurðsson. "Spurs" manager André Villas-Boas commented: ""It was a great debut for Christian, he is a pure number 10, a creative player and his individual quality made all the difference.""

On 19 September 2013, Eriksen "clipped a wonderful dipping shot" over the goalkeeper to score his first Tottenham goal and complete a 3–0 win over Tromsø IL in the Europa League. He added to his Tottenham goal tally with a goal from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against West Bromwich Albion on Boxing Day 2013, and the second goal in "Spurs"' 2–1 win against Manchester United on 1 January 2014. On 23 March, after goals from Jay Rodriguez and Adam Lallana had given Southampton a 2–0 lead against Tottenham at White Hart Lane, Eriksen scored twice to level the score and assisted Gylfi Sigurðsson to score the winning goal.

On 12 April 2014, he scored a stoppage-time equalizer as "Spurs" came from 3–0 down to draw 3–3 at West Bromwich Albion. By the end of the season, Eriksen had scored 7 goals in the Premier League.

Throughout the 2014/15 campaign, Eriksen played an integral part in many Spurs victories. The Danish international had a habit of scoring late winners, most notably against Swansea City, Sunderland, Hull City and many others.

On 10 January 2015, Eriksen was voted Danish Football Player of the Year twice in a row, making him the first player to do so since William Kvist.

On 28 January 2015, Eriksen completed his greatest performance of the campaign in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Sheffield United to send Tottenham into the League Cup Final. His first goal, a 30-yard curling free kick, was plauded by the likes of Michael Owen and Gary Neville among others on Twitter. Despite a late threat from the Blades, Eriksen then scored a second late-on to send Spurs to Wembley.

Eriksen completed the 2014/15 campaign having featured in every Premier League game for Mauricio Pochettino. The Dane became the third Spurs player to reach double figures in the league, alongside Nacer Chadli and Harry Kane, scoring 10 goals.

On 9 June 2015, Eriksen confirmed to Danish media whilst on international duty that he would stay at Tottenham for the foreseeable future. Eriksen was quoted as saying: "I feel right at home at Tottenham and I haven't thought about leaving yet."

Eriksen was called up to the Denmark national under-17 football team in July 2007, and impressed in his debut for the team on 31 July. In 2008, he scored 9 goals in 16 games for the U-17s, and was named Danish "U-17 Talent of the Year" by the Danish FA. He was also one of four nominees for the 2008 Danish "Talent of the Year" award, which was won by Mathias Jørgensen. He played 27 games for the under-17 team until February 2009. He played a total of 8 games for the Denmark U-18 and Denmark U-19 teams during 2009. Eriksen was also called up for the Danish U-21 squad to the European championship in Denmark in 2011, the Danish team only participated in the group stage and Eriksen scored a goal against Belarus.

He received his first senior Denmark call-up in February 2010, making his debut in Denmark's friendly match against Austria in March, to become Denmark's fourth youngest full international, being the youngest debutant since Michael Laudrup.

On 28 May 2010, Denmark coach Morten Olsen announced that Eriksen would be part of the final squad of 23 participating in the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He was the youngest player participating in the tournament. At the World Cup, Eriksen played two matches, against the Netherlands and Japan, but Denmark were unable to progress beyond the group stage.

On 9 February 2011, in a 1–2 friendly loss at home against England, Eriksen was named Man of the Match, and was praised for his performance by a number of prominent footballing figures, including Chelsea star Frank Lampard, Man Utd star Rio Ferdinand (on Twitter), manager Morten Olsen and several media experts in Denmark and England. On 4 June 2011 Eriksen scored his first national team goal, to give Denmark a 2–0 lead over Iceland in their Euro 2012 qualifier. In doing so, he became the youngest Danish player ever to score a goal in European qualification, being 9 days younger than Michael Laudrup when he scored his first goal in 1983.

On 10 January 2015, Eriksen was voted Danish Football Player of the Year twice in a row, making him the first player to do so since William Kvist.

In 2012, Eriksen signed a sponsorship kit deal with American sportswear and equipment supplier, Nike. He appeared in an advert for the new Nike Green Speed II alongside Raheem Sterling, Stephan El Shaarawy, Mario Götze, Eden Hazard and Theo Walcott in November 2012.

Christian then transitioned from Nike's Mercurial range, to the more 'creative' orientated Magista.




Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank

Norman Robert Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank, (born 1 June 1935) is an English architect. His company, Foster and Partners, has an international design practice. He is the United Kingdom's biggest builder of landmark office buildings.

He is one of Britain's most prolific architects of his generation. In 1999, he was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize, often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture. In 2009 Foster was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in the Arts category.

Early life

Foster was born to Robert Foster and Lilian Smith in 1935 in Reddish, Stockport, Cheshire. They moved, soon after his birth, two miles to 4 Crescent Grove in Levenshulme, Manchester, which they rented for fourteen shillings (70p) a week: Foster has no recollection of Reddish. Foster's parents were diligent, hard workers – so diligent that Foster, as an only child, felt their heavy workload restricted his relationship with them and he was often looked after by neighbours or other family members. He attended Burnage Grammar School for Boys in Burnage. In a "Guardian" interview in 1999, Foster said he always felt 'different' at school and was bullied and he retired into the world of books. He considered himself quiet and awkward in his early years often making faux pas.

Foster described Manchester as "one of the workshops of the world" and "the embodiment of a great city", his father, Robert, worked at Metropolitan-Vickers, Trafford Park which fuelled Foster's interest in engineering and design. He was fascinated with engineering and the process of designing. He says that caused him to pursue a career designing buildings. Specific interests included aircraft, a hobby he maintains today; and trains, generated by viewing passing trains on the railway outside his terraced home during his childhood.

He left school at 16 and worked in the Manchester City Treasurer's office. Next, he joined the National Service in the Royal Air Force. After he was discharged, in 1956 Foster attended the University of Manchester's School of Architecture and City Planning. He graduated in 1961. Later, Foster won the Henry Fellowship to the Yale School of Architecture, where he earned his Master's degree Foster also met Richard Rogers at Yale. He then travelled in America for a year. He returned to the UK in 1963. Then he set up an architectural practice as Team 4 with Rogers and the sisters Georgie and Wendy Cheesman. Georgie (later Wolton) was the only one of the team that had passed her RIBA exams. This allowed them to set up in practice on their own. Team 4 quickly earned a reputation for high-tech industrial design.

Education

Foster took a job as assistant to a contract manager with John Bearshaw and Partners, a local architectural practice.  The staff advised him, that if he wished to become an architect, he should prepare a portfolio of drawings using the perspective and shop drawings from Bearshaw's practice as an example. Bearshaw was so impressed with the drawings that he promoted the young Foster to the drawing department of the practice.

In 1956 Foster won a place at the University of Manchester School of Architecture and City Planning. Foster was not eligible for a maintenance grant so took up a number of part-time jobs to fund his studies, becoming an ice-cream salesman, night-club bouncer and working night shifts at a bakery to make crumpets. He combined these with self-tuition via visits to the local library in Levenshulme. Foster took a keen interest in the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Oscar Niemeyer and graduated from Manchester in 1961.

Foster won the Henry Fellowship to the Yale School of Architecture, where he met future business partner Richard Rogers and earned his master's degree. Vincent Scully encouraged Foster and Rogers to travel in America for a year. After returning to the UK in 1963 he set up an architectural practice as Team 4 with Rogers and the sisters Georgie and Wendy Cheesman. Georgie (later Wolton) was the only one of the team that had passed her RIBA exams allowing them to set up in practice on their own. Team 4 quickly earned a reputation for high-tech industrial design.

After Team 4 went their separate ways, Foster and Wendy Cheesman founded Foster Associates, which later became Foster and Partners in 1967. A long period of collaboration with American architect Richard Buckminster Fuller began in 1968 and continued until Fuller's death in 1983. They collaborated on several projects that became catalysts in the development of an environmentally sensitive approach to design – including the Samuel Beckett Theatre project.

Originally they concentrated on industrial buildings. The turning point was the 1969 administrative and leisure center for Fred. Olsen Lines in London Docklands, where workers and managers are not separated any more. Foster and Partners' breakthrough building in the UK was the Willis Faber & Dumas headquarters in Ipswich, of 1974. The client was a family run insurance company which wanted to restore a sense of community to the workplace. Foster created open plan office floors long before open-plan became the norm. In a town not over-endowed with public facilities, the roof gardens, 25 metre swimming pool and gymnasium enhanced the quality of life for the company's 1200 employees. The building has a full-height glass façade moulded to the medieval street plan and contributes drama, subtly shifting from opaque, reflective black to a glowing backlit transparency as the sun sets. The design was inspired by the Daily Express Building in Manchester a work Foster admired in his youth. The building is now Grade I* listed.

The Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, an art gallery and museum on the campus of the University of East Anglia, Norwich, was one of the first major public buildings to be designed by Foster, completed in 1978, and became grade II* listed in December 2012. In 1990 Foster's design for the Terminal Building at London Stansted Airport was awarded the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture / Mies van der Rohe Award.

Foster gained a reputation for designing office buildings. In the 1980s he designed the HSBC Main Building in Hong Kong for HSBC. The building is marked by its high level of light transparency, as all 3500 workers have a view to Victoria Peak or Victoria Harbour. Foster said that if the firm had not won the contract it would probably have been bankrupted. Foster believes that attracting young talent is essential, and is proud that the average age of people working for Foster and Partners is 32, just like it was in 1967.

Today, Foster + Partners works with its engineers to use computer systems. They pay attention to basic physical laws such as convection. They have created efficient buildings like the Swiss Re London headquarters in London. The walls let in air for passive cooling and then let it out as it warms and rises.

Foster's earlier designs reflected a sophisticated, machine-influenced high-tech vision. His style has evolved into a more sharp-edged modernity. In 2004, Foster designed the tallest bridge in the world, the Millau Viaduct in Southern France, with the Millau Mayor Jacques Godfrain stating; "The architect, Norman Foster, gave us a model of art."

In January 2007, "The Sunday Times" reported that Foster had called in Catalyst, a corporate finance house, to find buyers for Foster + Partners. Foster does not want to retire, but wants to sell his 80-90% holding in the company valued at £300M to £500M.

Foster is a member of the board of Trustees for the architectural charity Article 25. They design, construct and manage safe, sustainable buildings in dangerous parts of the world. He has also been on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation.
The reason for his wealth is he receives 15% of the building cost.

In 2007, he worked with Philippe Starck and Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin Group for the Virgin Galactic plans.

Foster designed the Apple Campus in Cupertino and is currently designing most of their Apple stores. He is also designing Bloomberg's headquarters in London. He also recently designed the Monaco Yacht club and the McLaren technology centre.

Foster currently sits on the board of trustees at architectural charity Article 25 who design, construct and manage innovative, safe, sustainable buildings in some of the most inhospitable and unstable regions of the world. He has also been on the Board of Trustees of the Architecture Foundation.

He has recently set up the Norman Foster Foundation which promotes interdisciplinary thinking and research to help new generations of architects, designers and urbanists to anticipate the future.

Foster recently set up his personal Instagram account under the username @officialnormanfoster where he publishes photos of his everyday life

Foster was knighted in 1990 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1997. In 1999, he was created a life peer, as Baron Foster of Thames Bank, of Reddish in the County of Greater Manchester. He was a Crossbencher; he resigned from the House of Lords in 2010 because he refused to pay UK taxes on his foreign earnings.

Norman Foster is the second British architect to win the Stirling Prize twice: the first for the American Air Museum at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in 1998, and the second for 30 St Mary Axe in 2004.

Foster was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1999.

He is also a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers and winner of the Minerva Medal, the Society's highest award. In Germany Lord Foster received the Order Pour le Mérite.

Most recently, in September 2007, Foster was awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, the largest architectural award in the world, for the University of Technology Petronas, in Malaysia.

It was announced in January 2008 that Foster was to be awarded an honorary degree from the Dundee School of Architecture at the University of Dundee. In 2009 Foster was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in the category "Arts".

In 2012, Foster was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.

In 2017, he was awarded the Freedom of the City of London for his contribution to contemporary architecture.

Foster married business partner Wendy Cheesman. She died in 1989, leaving him with four sons. whilst he was greiving, he was also diagnosed with bowel cancer. He next married Indian-born Begum Sabiha Rumani Malik. Sabiha was married to Andrew Knight when she and Foster met. Knight was Chairman of News International. Foster and Sabiha divorced in 1998. Foster is now married to Elena Ochoa, Chairman of the Tate International Council, and founder of Ivory Press. He has five children and three grandchildren.

Foster flies his own private jet and helicopter between his homes in London, France, Switzerland, Marthas Vineyard, New York and Madrid.

Foster has established an extremely prolific career in the span of four decades. The following are some of his major constructions:





The Bow, Calgary, Canada, 500 Centre Street SE
London, UK (1993–2001)







Foster's other design work has included the Nomos desk system for Italian manufacturer Tecno, and the motor yacht "Izanami" (later "Ronin") for Lürssen Yachts.

Thomas Heatherwick

Thomas Heatherwick (born 17th February 1970) is an English designer and artist. He is known for innovative use of engineering and materials in public monuments and sculptures. He heads the Heatherwick Studio, which he founded in 1994.

Born in London, he studied three dimensional design at Manchester Polytechnic and at the Royal College of Art, winning several prizes. Shortly after graduating from the Royal College of Art after a two-year furniture MA course in 1994, he was commissioned by Harvey Nichols department store in Knightsbridge to design a temporary structure for the shop's facade. His design was a ribbon of laminated wood that wound through the storefront windows. The design was widely acclaimed and won him a D&AD yellow pencil (the gold award) in 1997.

He founded Thomas Heatherwick Studio (now called just Heatherwick Studio) in 1994. His aim was "to bring architecture, design and sculpture together within a single practice". Originally based at Camden Mews, the studio moved to larger premises in Kings Cross in 2000. It presently comprises a thirty-strong team which includes architects, landscape architects, designers and engineers. Work is carried out from a combined studio and workshop where concept development, detailing, prototyping and small scale fabrication take place. The studio's work spans commercial and residential building projects, masterplanning and infrastructure schemes as well as high profile works of public art. 
Heatherwick is a Senior Fellow and external examiner at the Royal College of Art. He is a fellow of the Royal Academy and was recently chosen to become a Royal Designer for Industry. He has served on numerous judging and advisory panels and has given talks at various institutions including the RIBA, Bartlett School of Architecture, the South Africa Design Indaba conference and the Royal Academy. 

In 2004 he curated an exhibition at the Design Museum consisting of 1,000 'every day' design objects that he had collected.

The "B of the Bang" was a £1.42 million 56m-high sculpture of 180 giant spikes, erected outside the City of Manchester Stadium to celebrate the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Safety problems happened soon after it was completed in 2004 when one spike came apart. Eventually 22 more were removed as a safety measure. The object was rewelded and fenced off. It continued to cause concern and debate over its future. Finally Manchester City Council took legal action against Heatherwick studio and their subcontractors, who in November 2008 agreed to pay £1.7 million in damages. The installation was removed in 2009.

The 'East Beach Café' is a building on Littlehampton Sea Front, West Sussex, UK created by Heatherwick. Commissioned in 2005, the large steel structure houses a Café by daytime and restaurant in the evening. The concept allowed the steel to rust and the colours to develop over time before being fixed in a transparent oil. It won the 2008 RIBA Award in the South East region.


Thomas Heatherwick was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Arts by Manchester Metropolitan University - his alma mater - on July 21, 2007. It is in recognition of his design work across a broad spectrum of architecture, engineering and public art, achieving national and international acclaim for his innovative use of materials, his eclectic range of projects, and the resolution of them in new and exciting ways.


Louver

A louver (American English) or louvre (British English), from the French "l'ouvert"; "the open one") is a window, blind or shutter with horizontal or, less often, vertical slats. They are angled to allow light and air in. They also keep out rain, direct sunshine, and noise. The angle of the slats may be adjusted.

Louvers come from the Middle Ages as lantern-like constructions in wood that were fitted on top of roof holes. They were put in large kitchens to allow ventilation while keeping out rain and snow. They were originally rather rough constructions consisting only of a barrel. Later they became more elaborate designs made of pottery. They took the shape of faces where the smoke and steam from cooking would pour out through the eyes and mouth. They also became more like modern louvers, with slats that could be opened or closed by pulling on a string.

More modern louver windows are made of slats of glass, opened and closed with a metal lever. They may also be shutters of wood, plastic or other material.

Some modern louver systems serve to improve indoor daylighting. Fixed mirrored louver systems can limit glare and of redirect diffuse light. Such louvers may be put in between two panes of double glazing.

Louvers are rarely seen as primary design elements in the language of modern architecture. They are rather simply a technical device. However, there are examples of architects who use them as part of the overall aesthetic effect of their buildings. The most well-known example is Finnish modernist architect Alvar Aalto who would create aesthetic effects in the facades of his buildings through the combination of different types and sizes of louvers. Some are fixed and some are moveable. They are made mostly from wood (e.g. the various buildings of the Helsinki University of Technology). A second example, taking influence from Aalto, is the second-generation modernist architect Juha Leiviskä.

Additionally, louvers are used as semi-passive means of thermal control on spacecraft. They are also available as an accessory for some automobiles.


Lost (season 6)

The sixth and final season of the American television series "Lost" began broadcast in the United States and Canada on February 2, 2010. In the final 18 TV episodes, the writers showed the fate of the remaining survivors, and explained the powers which the Island held in their lives. The sixth-season premiere was the first to climb in the ratings year-over-year since the second season, drawing 12.1 million viewers. The series finale aired on May 23, 2010. The final episode ran 2.5 hours starting at 9/8 CDT, pushing the late-night news back a half-hour. It was followed by the previously announced post-finale special, "Jimmy Kimmel Live: Aloha to Lost", at 12:05 a.m. (11:05 CDT). The season continued the stories of the survivors of the fictional September 22, 2004 crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815, on an unknown island in the South Pacific. The survivors must deal with two outcomes of the explosion of a nuclear bomb on the island in the 1970s. While the on-island story continues, a set of "flash sideways" scenes show a second timeline, in which Flight 815 never crashes. The season was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 24, 2010, alongside a complete series boxset.
For a summary of the final season's storyline, see below: ""Season 6 plot summary"".

On May 7, 2007, ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson announced that "Lost" would end during the 2009–2010 season with a "highly anticipated and shocking finale". "We felt that this was the only way to give "Lost" a proper creative conclusion," McPherson said. Beginning with the 2007–2008 television season, the final 48 episodes would have been aired as three seasons with 16 episodes each, with "Lost" concluding in its sixth season. Due to the 2007-2008 writers' strike, the fourth season featured 14 episodes, and season 5 had 17 episodes. Season six was planned to have 17 episodes, too. However, on June 29 it was announced that the final season would feature an additional hour, making the number of episodes 18.

Executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse stated that they "always envisioned "Lost" as a show with a beginning, middle, and end," and that by announcing when the show would end that viewers would "have the security of knowing that the story will play out as we've intended." Lindelof and Cuse stated that securing the 2010 series-end date "was immensely liberating" and helped the series rediscover its focus. Lindelof noted, "We're no longer stalling." The producers also planned to wrap up long-standing mysteries, such as the nature of the smoke monster, the reason the Dharma periodic resupply drops continue after the purge, and the "bird" from "Exodus Pt. 2" and "Live Together, Die Alone Pt. 1". While the destruction of the four-toed statue of Taweret was revealed in the ninth episode of the final season, Lindelof hinted that the identity of the statue's builders would not be addressed. The producer also indicated that Walt's unusual abilities may be explained, although not necessarily with the character's direct involvement. In a podcast, Cuse and Lindelof stated that they would explain the "Rules" first stated in an episode in season four, but only those that are "important for the narrative they are telling." Matthew Fox said in an interview that in the final season, the characters of Jack Shephard and John Locke "will come head to head." It was also claimed that a third of the way through the final season, the two timelines would be "solidified into one" and "will be very linear – no more flashbacks, nothing;" however this was still not the case by the season midpoint. He also claimed to be the only cast member to know the ending of the series, though Lindelof has clarified that Fox only knew things that were relevant to his character.

During Comic-Con 2009, numerous sixth-season reports were made. Carlton Cuse stated both the time travel and flash-forward seasons were over, and they were moving into something different for the sixth season. Josh Holloway stated his character Sawyer would revert to his old self after the loss of Juliet. Though Cuse and Lindelof stated that the Dharma Initiative would no longer play a large role in the show, they have said that the "Dharma-Michigan connection" would play a significant role in season six. Lindelof stated that the producers had a direct hand in the production of the season six promotional poster that was first displayed at Comic-Con, and that everything in it was intentional; he also made a reference to the Abbey Road cover in connection to the poster. Season six was the first and only season of Lost ever to not feature any kind of preview or official promotional material such as sneak peeks and promo pictures for future episodes since the Lost producers considered any single frame from the first episodes to be too revealing. According to Lindelof, "even a single scene from the show would basically tip what it is we're doing this year, and what it is we're doing this year is different than what we've done in other years." Lindelof has also emphasized that the flashes-sideways are important, stating "People are saying [they] don't need these stories and all we can say is they're absolutely 100 percent necessary to tell the story of Lost, and hopefully by the end of the season it will be more obvious as to why." He also noted that the term "flash-sideways" was deliberately used instead of "alternate reality" because viewers might otherwise "infer that one of them isn't real, or one of them is real and the other is the alternate to being real." When asked to describe the last three episodes, Lindelof said "Water." 

ABC charged advertisers $900,000 USD for a 30-second commercial during the series finale, in contrast to the standard 2010 season price of $214,000.

The cast features fifteen major roles with star billing: eleven return from the fifth season, one returns from the fourth season after a year's absence, and three are new regular cast members. Unlike the latter half of the previous season, in which the cast was divided into two groups following two separate storylines, Season Six features an alternate universe scenario which the producers call "flash-sideways," and almost all the main characters participate in both storylines. Returning from the fifth season are the survivors' leader Dr. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox); former fugitive Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly); millionaire Hugo "Hurley" Reyes (Jorge Garcia); former torturer Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews); con artist James "Sawyer" Ford (Josh Holloway); medium Miles Straume (Ken Leung); former mob-enforcer Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and his privileged wife Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim); leader of the island's native population (known as the "Others") Ben Linus (Michael Emerson); and deceased crash survivor John Locke, who lives on in the sideways timeline but has been possessed in the original timeline by the mysterious Man In Black. Emilie de Ravin returns in her role as Claire Littleton, a new mother who was absent for one season after disappearing on the Island, and Henry Ian Cusick also returns as Desmond Hume, who starts the season off the Island. The new main cast roles go to pilot Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), an ageless advisor to the Others, and mysterious Flight 316 leader Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson). Carbonell was named a main cast member by the executive producers at Comic-Con 2009, after guest starring in the previous three seasons, and Fahey and Robinson were confirmed after appearing in recurring roles in the fourth and fifth seasons.

Several former cast members are scheduled to return to the show, or have been asked back. Elizabeth Mitchell returns as fertility specialist Dr. Juliet Burke. Mitchell has stated that her return is "instrumental to the story". Dominic Monaghan returned as rock star Charlie Pace in four episodes. Jeremy Davies returned as physicist Daniel Faraday in multiple episodes. Ian Somerhalder also returned as Flight 815 crash survivor Boone Carlyle in several episodes. Rebecca Mader, who portrays anthropologist Charlotte Lewis, also returned. The producers have also confirmed that Harold Perrineau and Cynthia Watros, who portray Michael Dawson and Libby Smith, respectively, returned in the second half of the season. About the return of Libby, Cuse stated, "Finally, all of your questions [about Libby] will be answered", however, Lindelof jokingly responded, "No, they will not". Michelle Rodriguez, another second season star, returned as police officer Ana Lucia Cortez, following a brief cameo in the fifth season. Maggie Grace, who portrays Shannon Rutherford, Boone's stepsister, was asked to return at the beginning of the season, but Grace was unable due to her schedule; she appeared later in the season, instead. Furthermore, the producers wished to bring back the character of Walt Lloyd, however Malcolm David Kelley, who portrays Walt, has aged significantly and the producers are working to overcome this obstacle.

Recurring characters who returned include: Jack and Claire's father, Dr. Christian Shephard (John Terry), wealthy industrialist and former Other Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), Desmond's wife Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger), former Other Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), Locke's ex-girlfriend, Helen Norwood (Katey Sagal), Hurley's former boss, Randy Nations (Billy Ray Gallion), mysterious Flight 316 passenger Bram (Brad William Henke), Sayid's wife, Nadia (Andrea Gabriel), deceased Frenchwoman Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), science teacher Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck), the Others' doctor Ethan Rom (William Mapother), Ben Linus' father Roger (Jon Gries), mercenaries Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) and Omar (Anthony Azizi), and Vincent, a dog who survived the crash of Flight 815 and lives on the island. Mark Pellegrino returns in his role as Jacob, the mysterious figure in charge of the island, while Titus Welliver also reprises his role as the mysterious unnamed character, known only as "The Man in Black", who appeared to be antagonistic to him in the season 5 finale. L. Scott Caldwell and Sam Anderson returned in their roles as Rose and Bernard respectively, as does Kimberley Joseph who plays 815 stewardess-turned-Other Cindy. Also, Academy Award-winner Fisher Stevens returns as communications officer George Minkowski from the first few episodes of the fourth season in the eleventh episode. Kevin Tighe returns as Anthony Cooper, Locke's father.

Several new recurring characters were introduced in the sixth season. "Deadwood" actor John Hawkes was cast to portray a character named Lennon and Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada obtained the role of ; both men are Others stationed at the temple. Also, William Atherton was cast in a guest role as the principal of the school where Ben works. Sheila Kelley has been cast in a recurring role that was initially described as "Kendall" and later confirmed to be "Zoe".

The sixth season followed two timelines, each an outcome of the explosion of a hydrogen bomb in the previous season finale. In the first timeline (referred to as "flash sideways"), Oceanic Flight 815 never crashes but lands with all leaving the airplane at Los Angeles LAX airport. In the second timeline, the remaining survivors return to the present day (on the Island) and must deal with the demise of "Jacob", whose death has been caused by the mysterious Man in Black, the Smoke Monster. According to show producer Damon Lindelof, the term "flash-sideways" was deliberately used instead of "alternate reality" because it might then imply "that one of them isn't real, or one of them is real and the other is the alternate to being real."

On the island, it is revealed that, long long ago, infant "Jacob" and his brother were stolen, from their birth mother, by a woman who raised them to become protectors of the island, after her. At the hidden center of the island, is a waterfall cave containing a bright power source. "Jacob" (with blond hair) and his brother (with black hair, symbolizing white and black) grow up with opposing viewpoints. "Jacob" stays loyal to his adoptive mother, but his brother joins with outsiders on the island. When the brother reveals that they have dug into the core of the island, tapping an underground power to escape, the mother hits the brother with a rock, and she destroys the people in their village. She then chooses "Jacob" to drink the water of immortality. His brother awakens to see the burned village, and seeking revenge, he finds and kills his adoptive mother. "Jacob" discovers her dead body, and in turn, throws his brother into the waterfall cave, transforming him into the black Smoke Monster.

Now centuries later, among the survivors, the Smoke Monster assumes the form of "John Locke", returned to the island in a coffin. This "Locke" had convinced "Ben" to enter the seaside cave and stab "Jacob", who fell into the fire and died. With many survivors believing that "Locke" has been resurrected, they follow him in various plans to leave the island. In one plan, they overthrow the guards at "Widmore's" submarine, and leave the island, unaware that a time bomb is inside the submarine. "Jack" (the doctor) discovers the time bomb, advising them not to disarm it while reasoning that the Smoke Monster cannot kill anyone directly. Instead, "Sawyer" (Ford) refuses to listen and pulls the bomb wires, which, instead, causes the bomb to count down faster. "Sayid" grabs the bomb and runs through the submarine, sacrificing himself to shield the others from the bomb blast. However, the bomb splits the submarine walls, and while sinking, "Sun-Hwa" is trapped in the wreckage, but "Jin" stays with her, vowing to never leave her side again, as they both die underwater.

"Jack" swims, with a breathing tube, to the surface and back to shore. He tells the rest that "Sun" and "Jin" did not escape. In anger, "Kate" vows to kill "John Locke", for what he has done to their friends. "Sayyid" (the Iraqi guard), "Richard", and "Miles" (son of the DHARMA leader) go to the other island to destroy the airplane. However, crossing at sea, they find the pilot adrift, who convinces them to repair the airplane to escape later.

The spirit of "Jacob" asks who among them would become Protector of the island, and "Jack" volunteers. At the waterfall cave, "Jack" drinks the water of immortality and returns to the group. "Jack" says they must meet with "Locke" and "Desmond" to settle the dispute and kill "Locke". The 2 groups meet on the hilltop, and just the 3 proceed toward the waterfall cave. There, "Desmond" descends on a rope into the cave, but pulls a rock from the bottom, which puts out the light of the power source. The island begins a series of earthquake tremors, to fall into the sea, with rocks tumbling into the water. "Locke" flees the area, now needing to get the sailboat to the other island: he has lost his immortality when the light source was put out. "Jack" chases him to the sea cliffs to stop him from leaving, and a long fight begins. "Locke" grabs a knife and stabs "Jack" in the side, then forces the knife up to "Jack's" neck. Before plunging the knife, a gunshot is heard: "Kate" as promised, has shot "Locke" (the Smoke Monster) in the back, and "Jack" pushes him off the sea cliff, to die on the rocks below.

"Jack" tells them he must return to the island core, as he promised Jacob, to restore the light at the waterfall cave. He instructs "Kate" to leave with "Sawyer" to get "Claire" into the airplane on the other island. "Kate" in turmoil kisses "Jack" goodbye, fearing it will be the last time. "Kate" and "Sawyer" jump into the sea and swim to the sailboat at anchor.

"Hurley" and "Ben" help "Jack" return to the waterfall cave. They lower "Jack" into the cave, where he revives and ties "Desmond" to the rope. "Jack" then puts the missing stone back into the floor, and restarts the light power source. When "Hurley" and "Ben" pull the rope, they find only "Desmond". They call below, but "Jack", overcome by the knife wound and rushing water, never answered, so they take "Desmond" away from the area. Some time later, Jack awakens, alone, outside the cave, as if lifted from the depth of the cave by an unseen force. Dazed, he wanders through the jungle, but he is losing strength. Just as with "Locke's" death, "Jack" also lost his immortality, and protection, at the first time the light source was put out. "Jack" falls to the ground, looking up to the blue sky. At that point, he sees "Kate's" plane flying far overhead, and then closes his eyes, for the last time.

Meanwhile, in the "flash-sideways" view of events, everyone has returned on Oceanic Flight 815, and all have resumed their original lives:
Soon after returning on Flight 815, "Desmond" has been tasked to ensure that bandmember "Charlie" stays sober to appear at a benefit concert for Charles Widmore. "Charlie" keeps talking about some imaginary, profound romance with a blonde girl, as if in some dream. Trying to rebel against "Desmond", he grabs the steering wheel, and the car goes into the harbor. Underwater, looking back inside the car to save "Charlie", he remembers seeing "" written on "Charlie's" hand, but not actually, then pulls him to the surface. They get rescued to the hospital, and Desmond asks, "Who is Penny?". Some memories come back, and Desmond begins to orchestrate a plan: at the school, he hits "John Locke" with his car, causing him to need surgery, led by "Jack Shephard" at the hospital. "Desmond" turns himself in to the police station for "Sawyer", who puts him in a jail cell near "Kate" and "Sayid".

Meanwhile, "Hurley" has been hired to free "Kate", "Sayid" and "Desmond" by paying Officer "Ana Lucia" to detour the prison van to the harbor. They get in 2 cars, and make plans to attend the benefit concert. "Desmond" and "Kate" drive to the church, where "Desmond" meets the funeral van, to accept the casket of "Christian Shephard" ("Jack's" father) into the chapel. This same day, "John Locke" has a 2nd spinal surgery, by "Jack", and regains feeling in his legs. Coming to the hospital to visit "Sun-Hwa", the police officer "Sawyer (Ford)" meets "Juliet" at the snack machines, where they both suddenly remember their parallel life, 3 years together on the island.

Now nighttime, "Hurley" drives "Sayid" to a backstreet, saying that he knows he is really a good guy: a fight breaks out in the alley, and a girl shouts, "Don't hurt my brother!" "Sayid", instinctively, jumps out to rescue her. When he sees her face, he remembers her: ""Shannon?"" Her stepbrother, "Boone" goes to the van and tells "Hurley", he is glad "Sayid" finally arrived because he was getting tired of staging the alley fight for them. "Desmond" attends the concert, where "Daniel Faraday's" mother talks to "Desmond" about the secret plan. While performing on stage, "Charlie" recognizes "Claire" in the audience, as the girl of his dreams, when she leaves to give birth to her son, assisted by "Kate" to get to the hospital.

Finally, "Kate" has convinced "Jack" (only partially aware of his parallel memories) to drive to the church, intended for his father's funeral. There, he enters the chapel, and upon touching his father's casket, he too begins to remember "everything" from the Island, all of them, including his years spent with "Kate". However, upon opening the casket, he finds it empty: his father has assumed a spirit form, and reminds him that he, too, died on the island, in his other life, which was as real as the present day. They both enter the church, where all the former islanders have gathered: "Sun" with "Jin"; "Sawyer" with "Juliet"; "Sayid" with "Shannon"; "Rose" with "Bernard"; "Hurley" with "Libby" (etc.). Even "Desmond" and "Penny" are together there, remembering their parallel life and birth of their child. Everyone who recently landed with Oceanic Flight 815, now greet and hug each other as if old friends, remembering how, once, they all were "lost" but now they have found each other.

Weather map

A weather map is a tool. It shows facts about the weather quickly. Weather maps have been used from the mid-19th century, for study and for weather forecasting. Some maps show differences of temperature, and weather fronts. 
A station model is a symbolic picture showing the weather at a reporting station. Meteorologists made the station model to put down many weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps thickly filled with station-model plots can be hard to read. However, they help meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer draws a station model for every place of observation. The station model is mostly used for surface-weather maps. It can also be used to show the weather in the sky, though. A complete station-model map lets people study patterns in air pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.

People first began using weather charts in a modern way in the mid-19th century. They began using them to make a theory about storm systems. When a telegraph network developed by 1845, it was possible for people to collect information about the weather. They could get the information from many different places far away quickly enough for the information to be useful. In the 1840s, Joseph Henry took charge. He helped the Smithsonian Institution focus most of its observers on the center and the eastern part of the United States during the 1840s and 1860s. The U.S. Army Signal Corps kept up this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress. It later expanded to the Western United States.

At first, all the data on the map was not taken from these analyses. This was because there was not enough time standardization. People first tried to standardize time in Great Britain in 1855. The entire United States was not influenced by time zones (areas with different times) until 1906. This was when Detroit had made the standard time at last. Over all the earth, other countries began taking weather observations at the same time. This started in 1873.

Chaetognatha

Chaetognatha, commonly known as arrow worms, are a phylum of small predatory marine animals. They are present in huge numbers in plankton worldwide.

About 20% of the known species are benthic and can attach to algae or rocks. They are found in all marine waters from surface tropical waters and shallow tide pools to the deep sea and polar regions. Most chaetognaths are transparent and are torpedo shaped, but some deep-sea species are orange. They range in size from .

Despite the huge numbers, there are only about 120 modern species in 20 genera. Some species are known to use the neurotoxin "tetrodotoxin" to subdue their prey.

Chaetognaths appear to have originated in the Cambrian Period. Complete body fossils have been described from China, Greenland and the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia.

These animals are usually considered a type of protostome, closely related to rotifers.

Pepper spray

Pepper spray (also called OC spray, from Oleoresin capsicum) is a spray used for self-defence, by spraying it into an attacker's face. It makes eyes water and causes intense pain, sometimes even leading to temporary blindness. Pepper spray is an inflammatory agent. When someone is sprayed with pepper spray, their eyes will close and they will have difficulty breathing, a runny nose, and cough. The stronger the spray is, the longer the effects last, but the average full effect lasts around thirty to forty-five minutes, with longer effects lasting for hours. Pepper spray is mostly used by police forces for riot control, but in some countries people can use it for self-defence. 

The active ingredient in pepper spray is capsaicin, a chemical found in capsicums, chillis and other members of the pepper family. 

Pepper spray usually comes in canisters and can be sprayed up to twenty-five metres.

Alexei Shirov

Alexei Shirov (born 4 July 1972 in Riga, Latvia) is a chess grandmaster. He has consistently ranked among the world's top players since the early 1990s, and reached a ranking as high as number four in 1998. Shirov is also a well-regarded chess author.

Shirov became the World Champion (under 16) in 1988, and achieved the title of grandmaster in 1990. He is the winner of numerous international tournaments.

In 1998 Shirov's ranking rose to number four in the world. On the basis of his rating, he was invited to play a ten-game match against Vladimir Kramnik to select a challenger for World Champion Garry Kasparov. Shirov won the match with two wins, no losses and seven draws. However the plans for the Kasparov match fell through when funds could not be raised. When Kasparov played Kramnik for the world title in 2000, Shirov maintained that the match was invalid and he was the rightful challenger.

In 2000, Shirov reached the final of the FIDE World Chess Championship, losing to Viswanathan Anand.

In May/June 2007 he played in the Candidates Tournament of the FIDE World Chess Championship. He won his first round match against Michael Adams (+1-1=4, won in rapid playoff), but was eliminated when he lost his second round match to Levon Aronian (+0-1=5). In November/December 2007 Shirov played in the Chess World Cup. He lost in the final 2.5-1.5 to Gata Kamsky.

In May 2009, Alexei Shirov achieved the greatest triumph of his career by placing 1st in the high Category 21 M-Tel Masters 2009 tournament, a double round tournament held in Sofia, Bulgaria. He was undefeated, and scored 6.5/10—seven draws and three victories, two against Vassily Ivanchuk and the other against Magnus Carlsen in the final round. By this success he was given entry to the Grand Slam Chess Final 2009 in Bilbao where he met Levon Aronian, Sergey Karjakin (winner of Corus 2009), and Alexander Grischuk (winner of Linares 2009).

In 1994 Shirov married, and later divorced, Verónica Alvarez, moved to Tarragona, and became a citizen of Spain. He married, then later divorced, Lithuanian IM/WGM Viktorija Čmilytė from 2001 to 2008. Although he still plays for Spain, he now lives in Latvia.

Shirov is noted for his attacking style and for seeking complications, a tendency which has led to comparisons with fellow Latvian and former world champion, Mikhail Tal, under whom he studied in his youth.

During the 1998 Linares chess tournament Shirov played black against future FIDE world champion Veselin Topalov and won with a piece sacrifice in a bishop and pawn ending.

Series 7 would be the last series after the BBC decided to cancel the series. The final episode aired on 25 July 2002. The final two special episodes aired in 2003.


Pavel Eljanov

Pavel Eljanov (born 1983) is a Ukrainian chess grandmaster.
Eljanov's most notable tournament result to date was winning Corus B tournament 2007 in Wijk aan Zee, Holland with a score of 9/13. This result enabled him to qualify for the category 20 tournament Corus A 2008.

On the September 2010 FIDE rating list, Eljanov had a rating of 2761, making him number 1 in Ukraine and number 6 in the world. His results in the Russian premier league had been exceptional. Since then he has slipped to #21.

Lactase

Lactase is an enzyme which acts on lactose, breaking it down so it can be digested. 

Mammals in their infancy usually make lactase: they need it for digesting the lactose found in their mother's milk. Mammalian adults usually lose the capacity to produce lactase. Thus, if you give milk to an adult cat it causes discomfort and diarrhea.

Humans are somewhat different. Some humans continue to produce lactase, and some do not. It is a type of polymorphism.

The ability to digest lactose into adulthood ('lactase persistence') was useful to humans after the development of animal husbandry. This created a system providing a consistent supply of milk. 

Hunter-gatherer populations before the Neolithic revolution were overwhelmingly lactose intolerant. So are modern hunter-gatherers. 

A mutation on chromosome #2 stops the shutdown in lactase production, making it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk (and eating other dairy products) throughout their lives.

This appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy consumption. It has occurred independently in both northern Europe and East Africa in populations with a pastoral lifestyle. Lactase persistence, allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood, is a dominant allele, making lactose intolerance a recessive trait. 

Genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence only reached appreciable levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years. Therefore, lactase persistence is often cited as an example of recent human evolution. As lactase persistence is genetic, but animal husbandry a cultural trait, this is gene–culture coevolution.


Tanduay

NBA TV

NBA TV is a television specialty channel. It is dedicated to showcasing the sport of basketball in the United States. The network is financially backed by the National Basketball Association (NBA), which also uses NBA TV as a way of advertising their out of market package NBA League Pass.

NBA TV replaced Time Warner's CNN/SI on many cable systems after that network shut down a year earlier.

NBA TV offers basketball news every day, as well as programming showcasing basketball players' individual lifestyles, life as a basketball team during an NBA season, famous games of the past, and live games typically four days a week during the NBA season. Live games on NBA TV are subject to local blackout restrictions, since NBA TV does not have exclusive broadcast rights to any of its games. Games carried by NBA TV are always also carried by each team's local rights holder.

The channel also shows international games, typically on Saturday evenings, with special emphasis on the Euroleague and the Maccabi Tel Aviv team from Israel. In April 2005, the channel televised the Chinese Basketball Association finals for the first time.
NBA TV carries at least 90 regular-season games per season, all broadcast in high definition, as well as some first-round playoff games. It also broadcasts WNBA games nationally (subject to local blackout).

The channel's flagship program is "NBA Gametime Live", a show in which a host and studio analysts go over the latest news, highlights, and look in at games in progress. The show is live six days a week, not airing on most Thursdays due to NBA's coverage of "The NBA on TNT". An edited one hour/thirty minute version of the broadcast is repeated throughout the late night/early morning hours.


The studio host and analysts vary every night on NBA Gametime Live.



On October 8, 2007, it was reported that Turner Sports, a division of Time Warner, was to take over the channel's operations, according to
Hoopsworld:
"NBATV: Surprisingly there has been little said about the NBA's decision to sell off NBATV to one of its media partners. Talks had gone on for as ESPN/ABC and Turner both explored scenarios with the league. Ultimately it seems Turner has won out, and will take over operation of the league's flagship cable channel, that reaches some 12 million subscribers. The exact changeover date is not clear, but several months ago a Bloomberg report cited sources saying senior level producers were offered contract buyouts in September."

Turner Sports relaunched the channel on October 28, 2008, using analysts carried over from NBA on TNT.

In 2001, Raptors NBA TV begin airing in Canada. Although quite similar to NBA TV, there is a larger focus on the Toronto Raptors basketball team, due to Canadian content requirements and restrictions on foreign ownership (the channel is owned by Raptors parent company Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, not the league).

Both are in black and gray

On April 16, 2009, it was announced that DirecTV and the NBA reached a new carriage agreement. NBA TV was moved from the satellite television provider's add-on Sports Pack (and premium subscription package NBA League Pass) to its lower priced base package Choice Xtra on October 1, 2009. DirecTV believes the move will make the channel available to an additional 8 million subscribers.

On June 4, 2009, it was announced that the NBA and Comcast have reached a deal to move the channel from the cable company's add-on Sports Entertainment Package to its basic level Digital Classic package, by the start of the 2009-10 NBA season. Comcast believes an additional 8 million customers will now have access to the channel.

Verizon FiOS added the channel and NBA League Pass for the first time on September 23, 2009.

The channel also signed new multiyear agreements with Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, and Dish Network on October 22, 2009. They also reached a new deal with Cox Cable earlier this year.

Gifted education

Gifted education is a term for special ways to educate (teach) children who have been identified as gifted. There is no definition of a gifted student which everyone agrees on.

Gifted and talented education has a long history of thousands of years. Plato (c. 427–c. 347 BCE) was in favour of providing specialized education for intellectually gifted young men and women. In China's Tang Dynasty (580-618 CE), child prodigies were summoned to the imperial court for specialized education. Throughout the Renaissance, those who showed creative talent in art, architecture, and literature were supported by both the government and private patronage.

In 2011, the National Association for Gifted Children published a position paper that stated what a gifted student is. The word "gifted," describes people who demonstrate outstanding aptitude or competence in one or more domains. An "aptitude" is defined as an exceptional ability to learn or reason. "Competence" is defined as documented performance or achievement in the top 10% of the population.

Sport England

Sport England is the name for the English Sports Council. It is a non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

Sport England also helps more talented people do well by identifying them early, nurturing them, and helping them move up to the top level.

Sport England has two statutory, functions: (1) a lottery distributor for sport; and (2) it must be consulted on planning applications that affect playing fields. The funding it distributes comes from both H.M. Treasury and the National Lottery. Since 1994, it has invested over £2bn of lottery funds and £300 million from the Exchequer into sports in England.


Manic Street Preachers

Manic Street Preachers (often referred to as the Manics) are an alternative rock band from Blackwood, Wales, formed in 1986. They are James Dean Bradfield (vocals, guitars), Nicky Wire (bass, occasional vocals) and Sean Moore (drums, backing vocals, occasional trumpet). The band is part of the Cardiff music scene. Their biggest success was during the 1990s.

The band were originally a four piece band: lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards mysteriously vanished on 1 February 1995. In November 2008, 13 years after his disappearance, he was officially declared presumed dead.

The Manics released their debut album "Generation Terrorists" in 1992. Their combination of androgynous glam punk imagery, outspoken
invective and songs about "culture, alienation, boredom and despair" soon gained them a loyal following and cult status. The band's later albums kept a politicized and smart lyrical style. They also adopted a broader alternative rock sound. Enigmatic lyricist Richey Edwards gained early notoriety by carving the words "4 REAL" into his arm with a razor blade (narrowly missing an artery and requiring seventeen stitches) in response to the suggestion that the band were less than authentic. The dark nature of 1994's "The Holy Bible" showed the result of Edwards' instability.

Following Edwards' disappearance, Bradfield, Moore, and Wire kept with the Manic Street Preachers and went on to gain critical and commercial success. They became one of Britain's top rock bands. They have had eight top ten albums and fifteen top ten singles. They have reached number one three times, with their 1998 album "This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours" and the singles "If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next" (1998) and "The Masses Against The Classes" (2000). They have also won the Best British Album and Best British Group accolades at the BRIT Awards in 1997 and 1999, and were lauded by the NME for their lifetime achievements in 2008. Their ninth studio album, "Journal For Plague Lovers", was released on 18 May 2009 and features lyrics Edwards had left behind to the band weeks before his disappearance.
In 2010 their tenth album "Postcards from a Young Man" was released. Their eleventh album "Rewind the Film" was released on 16 September 2013. Their next album "Futurology" is going to be released in 2014.


Turnstile

A turnstile, also called a baffle gate, is a type of gate. It only allows one person to pass at a time. It can also be made so as to make one-way traffic of people. It can also make passage only to people who put in a coin, a ticket, a pass, or similar. A turnstile can be used for paid access (sometimes called a faregate when used for this). For example, it can be used in public transport as a ticket barrier or at a pay toilet. 

Turnstiles are used at a variety of places. This includes stadiums, amusement parks, museums, and mass transit stations.

Regional casino

A Regional Casino, more commonly known as a Super Casino (or occasionally known as Mega Casino), is the term given to the largest category of casino that was to have been permitted under UK law. It is meant to be the same size as the larger casinos in Las Vegas. The first Regional Casino was proposed to be in the City of Manchester. This was stopped by the UK government soon after Gordon Brown became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

The Gambling Act 2005 revised many regulations relating to gambling in England. Amongst the most controversial provisions was the establishment of a number of 'destination casinos' in the style of Las Vegas, commonly referred to in the media as 'Super Casinos'

Initial drafts of the act proposed eight regional casinos but concerns expressed in the national media and by a range of addiction related social and religious groups meant that the final revision of the act permitted only one casino of the largest size, referred to as a 'Regional Casino', with a further eight 'large' and eight 'small' casinos of a smaller sizes and with reduced Jackpot limits.

Prior to the act there were 140 casinos in the UK, the largest of which in Star City, Birmingham had a floor area of around 950 square metres. Customers were required to register twenty-four hours prior to gaming.

Under the terms of the Gambling Act the Secretary of State is able to define each type of Casino, with reference to any matter he or she chooses; although the act specifically mentions as facts to consider the number, location and concentration of gaming tables, and the floor area designated for a specific purpose.

Definitions have been determined such that the 'super casino' will have a minimum customer area of 5000 square metres and at most 1250 unlimited-jackpot slot machines.

'Large casinos' will have a minimum area of 1000 square metres and up to 150 slot machines with a maximum jackpot of £4000.

The 'small casinos' will have a minimum customer area of 750 sq metres, up to 80 slot machines and a jackpot of £4000.

In May 2006, a short-list of eight sites, selected from various ones submitted by local councils, was announced for the location of the Regional Casino. These were:

On 30 January 2007 it was announced that the first Regional Casino would be built in East Manchester near the City of Manchester Stadium. This was a shock to the Blackpool and The O (formerly the Millennium Dome) bids. Both of them were thought of as the favourites. However, the Blackpool bid organisers pledged to continue the work in getting government approval for a 'supercasino'.


Royal Institute of British Architects

The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) is a professional organisation for architects in the United Kingdom.

It was originally named the Institute of British Architects in London and formed in 1834. The group was started by several important architects, including Philip Hardwick, Thomas Allom, William Donthorne, Thomas Leverton Donaldson, John Buonarotti Papworth and Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey. It was awarded a Royal Charter in 1837, becoming the Royal Institute of British Architects in London, eventually dropping the reference to London in 1892.

The RIBA is a member organisation, with 44,000 members. Chartered Members are allowed to call themselves chartered architects and to add the post-nominals RIBA after their name; Student Members are not permitted to do so. In the past, fellowships of the institute were given, but this has stopped; those who continue to hold this title instead add FRIBA.

RIBA is based at 66 Portland Place, London—a 1930s Grade II* listed building designed by architect George Grey Wornum with sculptures by Edward Bainbridge Copnall and James Woodford. The Institute also maintains a dozen regional offices around the United Kingdom. Parts of the London building are open to the public, including the exhibition galleries and Library.

Bahrain International Circuit

The Bahrain International Circuit (BIC) is a motorsport track opened in 2004 and used for auto racing. The main race is the Bahrain Grand Prix. The 2004 Grand Prix was the first held in the Middle East. In 2006, Australian V8 Supercar started racing at the BIC. 24 Hour endurance races also hosted at BIC.

Building the Bahrain circuit (track) was important for Bahrain, and was started by the Crown Prince, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa. The Crown Prince is the Honorary President of the Bahrain Motor Federation.

In the track became the first Grand Prix circuit to be awarded the distinguished (important) FIA Institute Centre of Excellence award. The award was given for having and keeping high race safety and medical facilities.

The track was designed by German architect Hermann Tilke. Tilke also designed the Sepang circuit in Malaysia. The track cost approximately US $150 million to build. It can be set-up as six different tracks, including a test oval and a drag strip.

The track had a special problem. The track was located in the middle of a desert. There were concerns that sand would blow onto the track and disrupt the race. Organizers (the people who run the race) were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an adhesive (glue) on the sand around the track.

The surface of the track has a high level of grip. The same surface is used at the Yas Marina Circuit for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

The Bahrain International Circuit hosts a number of races, including the FIA Formula One World Championship, the Australian V8 Supercar Championship Series, the GP2 Series, GP2 Asia, Chevrolet Lumina Series, Speedcar Series, Thunder Arabia and Radical.

In the past the track has hosted the FIA GT Championship, and a one-time Bahrain Superprix involving Formula Three cars, following from the failure of the Korea Super Prix. The first Formula BMW World Final took place in Bahrain. Every year there is the 24 Hours of Bahrain race.

The first Bahrain Grand Prix took place on 4 April 2004, making history as the first Formula One Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East. Other countries, including Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates wanted to host the Formula One Grand Prix.

The Bahrain Grand Prix is usually the third race on the Formula One schedule. In the 2006 season, Bahrain traded places with the usual first race, the Australian Grand Prix. The Australian Grand Prix date was changed to avoid interfering with the Commonwealth Games. In , Bahrain was moved to the fourth race on the schedule. In , Bahrain was the first race of the season. For 2010, the Formula One cars raced on the full "Endurance Circuit".

Starting in 2011, Formula One will return to the original track layout. This is the layout that was used in 2004.

The Muharraq Governorate is one of the five governorates of Bahrain. It is together with the municipality of Al Muharraq and with Muharraq Island and with outlying islets. It includes the former municipality of Al Hadd at the southern end of that island. 

Muharraq is Bahrain's second largest city and is also called the "Place of Ashes".

1997 Qayen earthquake

The 1997 Qayen earthquake was a large earthquake that struck in Northern Iran's Khorasan Province on May 10, 1997. It was also known as the Quayen, Ardekul or Qaen earthquake. It was the largest in that area since 1990 and measured 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale. It was the third earthquake in 1997 that caused a lot of damage. It killed 1,567 people and injured over 2,300. It also left 50,000 homeless by damaging over 15,000 homes. There were 155 aftershocks that added to the damage, which was guessed to cost about $100 million.

The United States Geological Survey said that it was the most deadly earthquake in 1997.

Wind turbine

A wind turbine is a rotating machine that transfers kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical energy. If the mechanical energy is used directly by machinery, such as for pumping water, cutting lumber or grinding stones, the machine is called a windmill. If the mechanical energy is instead converted to electricity, the machine may be called a wind turbine generator (WTG), wind power unit (WPU), wind energy converter (WEC), or aerogenerator.

The wind turbine's blades are turned by the wind. This turns a shaft turning slowly, at about 10-20 rpm with a high torque. The shaft goes into a reduction gearbox with a ratio of about 1:50, although some wind turbine gearboxes can have a ratio of 1:100 or more. Some wind turbines may have no reduction gearbox at all, and have a ratio of 1:1. The gearbox turns the generator more quickly, at around 1000 rpm, at a low torque. The generator creates electricity. This electricity is combined with any other wind turbines that may be in the same wind farm. This combined electricity may be used locally, or adjusted to match the electricity in the power grid and sent to the power grid.

Although wind turbines are a renewable source of energy and don't pollute the environment as a result of generating power, they have an environmental impact. Some people think that wind turbines create a lot of noise and look unappealing. However, wind turbines are placed no closer than 300 meters from residential homes. At that distance, a wind turbine is no louder than an average household air conditioner.

Wet-tail

Wet-tail or proliferative ileitis, is a disease in rodents kept in cages, mainly hamsters, but can include rabbits, gerbils, rats, and mice. It is caused by stress. Even with treatment, the animal can die within 24–48 hours. Baby hamsters are much more likely to get the disease than older hamsters. It commonly is found when the hamster is being weaned at about four weeks of age.

Wet-tail is a disease in the animal's intestines caused by the bacteria, "Lawsonia intracellularis". Wet-tail is stress related. The stress can be caused by:


The symptoms may not appear for several days. The main symptom is the animal has a wet tail, matted with faeces. Other signs of the disease are: 

There are drugs to treat wet-tail which can be bought from pet shops. A vet may choose to give the animal other drugs. The sick animal should be kept in a cage by itself so that others do not catch the disease.

Luxury box

The luxury box or luxury suite is the North American term for a special seating section in arenas, stadiums and other sports venues. In the United Kingdom and Australia the terms used are corporate box, executive box, sky box and private box. They are usually in the mid-section of the stadium. The seats have usually the best views of the sporting event. Some have glass panels that can be opened, in order for the spectators to feel closer to the action of the sporting event. The inside of a luxury box usually has a bar, several televisions sets, a row of seats and a private bathroom. The boxes are usually catered. The lease to a box also comes with a personal parking space, and a private entrance. The boxes usually generate more revenue than regular seating.

Contactless smart card

A contactless smart card is a kind of smart card with integrated circuits that can process and save data. Most cards are as big as a credit card. They can receive information which is processed and delivered through radio. There are two main kinds of contactless smart cards. 

Many people believe contactless smart cards have a read-only RFID inside it. This is not true, but they do have a re-writable smart card microchip inside them. Contactless smart cards can be used for identification, authentication, and saving data.


Pericles' Funeral Oration

Pericles' Funeral Oration is a famous speech from Thucydides' "History of the Peloponnesian War". The speech was delivered by Pericles at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War (431 - 404 BCE). He was a famous Athenian politician. The speech was a part of the yearly public funeral for the people who died in the war.

At that time, people in Athens had a custom of holding a public funeral for the people who died in war. The bodies of the dead were left out for three days in a tent, where offerings could be made for the dead.

"Funeral Oration" was recorded by Thucydides in book two of his "History of the Peloponnesian War". Thucydides records the speech as if every word in the record was what Pericles said. However, people agree he did, at least, correct or change the speeches a little. Thucydides says in his "History" that the speeches are not completely the same as what was really said, but written to show the main ideas of what was said. It is quite certain that Pericles delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war. However, people are not sure how much Thucydides' record is the same as Pericles' actual speech.

The Funeral Oration is important because the speech was different from usual Athenian funeral speeches. David Cartwright describes it as "a eulogy (description) of Athens itself...". The speech is about what great things Athens did, delivered to encourage the people.

American Civil War scholar Garry Wills calls Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address the modern parallel to Pericles' Funeral Oration.

Gorgoneion

In Ancient Greece, the Gorgoneion () was originally a magic pendant showing the Gorgon's head. (The use of magic against evil, or bad luck is generally called Apotropaism). 
The gorgoneion was linked with the gods Zeus and Athena; both are said to have worn it as a pendant. It was also popular as a royal symbol, worn on shields and capes. These can be seen on the Alexander Mosaic and the Gonzaga Cameo.

Homer wrote about the Gorgon on four occasions, but only about the head, as if the creature had no body. Jane Ellen Harrison notes that "Medusa is a head and nothing more...a mask." The body was added many years later. Up to the 5th century BC, the head was shown as being very ugly, with her tongue sticking out, boar tusks, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring straight ahead and the snakes twisting all around her.

The direct frontal stare was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. In some cases a beard, (probably representing streaks of blood) was added to her chin, making her appear as a wild and sexual god, like Dionysus.

Gorgoneia painted on the shields of warriors on mid-5th century Greek vases are not as ugly, strange or frightening. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized. The Hellenistic marble known as the Medusa Rondanini shows how the Gorgon changed over time into a beautiful woman.

Gorgoneia are first seen in Greek art at the beginning of the 8th century BC. One of the earliest is on a coin found during an archaeological dig at Parium. Other early 8th-century examples were found at Tiryns. There is a similar image from the Knossos palace, dating from the 15th century BC. Marija Gimbutas even argues that "the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the Sesklo culture illustrates".

In the 6th century BC, gorgoneia of a basic type of "lion mask" were found all over Greek temples, especially in and around Corinth. Pedimental gorgoneia were common in Sicily; probably the earliest one is in the Temple of Apollo in Syracuse. Around 500 BC, they stopped being used to decorate monumental buildings, but were still shown on parts of the roof tiles (antefix) of smaller buildings throughout the next century.

As well as temples, the Gorgon image can be found on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins across the Mediterranean region from Etruria to the Black Sea coast. The Gorgon coins were made in 37 cities, making her image on coins second only to some of the main Greek gods. On mosaic floors, the gorgoneion was usually near the door, as if guarding it. On Attic kilns, a gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from accidents.

The Gorgon image remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the Byzantine Empire, including Kievan Rus (now the Ukraine). The image was used in Western Europe by the Italian Renaissance artists. In the 20th century, the gorgoneion was used by Gianni Versace as a logo for his fashion company.

Gimbutas says the gorgoneia are part of the Mother Goddess cult linked to "dynamic life energy". She said the gorgoneion is a typical European image. Jane Ellen Harrison, on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks. These are meant to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at him.

Gustave Courbet

Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet (10 June 1819 – 31 December 1877) was a French painter. He was the leader of the Realist movement in 19th-century French painting. Courbet was prepared to try out new ideas and ways of painting. His paintings made social comment on the world around him.

Courbet's paintings were an inspiration to many other painters, particularly the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec were all inspired by Gustave Courbet's paintings of people. His landscape paintings were an inspiration to Claude Monet, Seurat, Cezanne and many other painters.

Courbet was born in 1819, and was the son of Régis and Sylvie Oudot Courbet in Ornans, Doubs. Courbet's sisters, Zoé, Zélie and Juliette, were his first models for drawing and painting.

When Courbet was twenty he went to Paris in 1839, and worked at the studio of two other painters, Steuben and Hesse. He was not happy there, and wanted to work on his own. He studied the works of many great masters, including Goya, Velazquez and Titian. He painted several self-portraits at this time. He often returned home to Ornans to hunt, fish and find inspiration in the countryside and country life.

In 1846–1847 Coubet travelled to the Netherlands and Belgium where he studied the paintings of Rembrandt, Franz Hals and Jan Steen who all painted in the 1600s. The paintings by these artists often showed realistic scenes and portraits of everyday life. They showed ordinary people at the table together, dancing, writing, cooking, working at trades and in businesses and in the fields. There were many pictures of soldiers. Courbet decided that he wanted to paint scenes of ordinary life the way that these artists did. He did not want to paint scenes from literature, history or mythology like most other artists in France at that time.

Courbet painted a large picture of everday-life at Ornans. The painting, called "After Dinner at Ornans", shows four men who have just finished a meal at a little table, which is perhaps in an inn. One man is playing his violin, one man is lighting his pipe. Courbet sits listening, with his head leaning on his hand. A large dog is curled under a chair. Courbet showed the painting at the Salon Exhibition in Paris. It was a great success. It won a Gold Medal and was bought by the French Government. Because of the gold medal, Courbet could hang his pictures at the Salon Exhibitions without having them checked by a jury first. This rule was changed in 1857. Courbet's work, and the work of Honoré Daumier and Jean-François Millet, became known as "Realism". Like the Dutch painters he admired, Courbet often painted in broad, rough brush strokes. He often used dark earthy colours, particularly brown, in his paintings.

In 1849 Courbet saw two people working by the roadside, using small hammers to break large rocks into gravel. One was an old man and the other was a young boy. Courbet painted a picture of this scene. He explained it to a friend ""It is not often that one meets with so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting. I told them to come to my studio the next morning.""

The picture soon became one of the most famous scenes of the life of poor people that has ever been painted. It was destroyed during World War II in Dresden.

Courbet's other important painting that was shown at the Salon of 1850 was a scene of life at his village. Beginning in 1849, he painted the funeral of his great-uncle who had died the previous year. Courbet got all the village people who had been at the funeral to come to his studio and pose for him, one by one, until the painting was complete. The painting was very large, 10 by 22 feet (3.1 by 6.6 meters). The famous artist Jacques Louis David had once painted a very large picture in the same way. David's picture was of the "Coronation of Napoleon" and showed all the people who were present.

Some people praised "The Funeral at Ornans" but other people were very angry about it. They thought that it was wrong to show the burial of an ordinary man in a huge painting, as if he was as important as an emperor. They thought that it was wrong to show the poor people of a village, with their old clothes and dirty boots, as if they were all as important as lords and ladies. Some of the critics said that Courbet was deliberately trying to paint ugliness. Many people came to see the picture and liked the new Realist way of painting. Courbet said: ""The Burial at Ornans was ... the burial of Romanticism.""

Courbet became a celebrity. (He became famous and written about in the newspapers- like a film star.) People said he was a genius, a "terrible socialist", and a "savage". 
Courbet wrote to a friend in 1850:
During the 1850s Courbet painted many other pictures using common folk and friends as his subjects, such as "Village Damsels" (1852), the "Wrestlers" (1853), "Bathers" (1853), "The Sleeping Spinner" (1853), and "The Wheat Sifters" (1854).

Courbet then painted another huge picture. This painting is called "The Artist's Studio" and is about seven years in his life as a painter. He shows himself at the centre of the picture, working on a large landscape painting. Behind him is an artists' model, who is naked. All around Courbet are his friends and people from his village. His mother stands to one side of the picture. Another woman is sitting on the floor feeding her baby. A little boy watches the artist, while a white cat plays on the floor.

In 1855 Coubet took this picture, with "Burial at Ornan" and twelve other paintings to be shown in a big international exhibition in Paris called "Exposition Universelle". The two biggest paintings and another one were sent away because there was not enough room. Courbet was angry. He had his own building put up, and showed forty of his paintings. Many other artists praised Courbet, but some people laughed at him, and the public did not buy very many of his pictures. Because of what he had done, younger artists heard about him and admired him. These included James McNeill Whistler in the United States as well as Édouard Manet in France.

In 1857 Courbet showed six pictures in the Salon exhibition. One was a hunting scene and one was a picture of two prostitutes lying under a tree on the banks of the River Seine in Paris. Many people came to the exhibition. The hunting scenes were very popular for decorating the halls and dining rooms of large houses.

For the rest of his life, Courbet painted erotic pictures like the picture of the prostitutes, and also many more hunting scenes. His last erotic painting was called "The Origin of the World" and was a close-up painting of female genitals. This painting was not shown in a public exhibition until 1988. He also painted many landscapes, which he began by doing outdoor sketches, then made into large paintings in his studio. By the 1870s Courbet was thought of as one of the leading artists in France. The emperor offered to make Courbet a member of the Légion d'honneur which was the highest honour in France, but Courbet refused to accept it. He believed that he belonged to the poor and ordinary people, not to the high and mighty.

At this time, there were many political problems in France. Courbet became involved in the political problems. In 1871, he was blamed because a public monument called the Vendôme Column had been demolished. He was put in prison for six months. In 1873, the new government expected him to pay to have the monument restored and put back. He did not have enough money so left France to live in Switzerland. The government decided to make terms so that Courbet could pay for the column in yearly payments of 10,000 francs for 33 years. Courbet died at La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland, on 31 December 1877, one day before the first payment was due. He was 58 and died of liver disease, made worse by heavy drinking.

Dispute

A dispute/disagreement is a continuing disagreement carried on between two or more parties. The parties may be people, or they may be organisations or countries. Disputes can last a long time, and they can have serious results. Dispute may happen from controversy. Disputes may become conflicts or polemic. Disputes between individual people may lead to violence. Disputes between organisations may lead to legal action. Disputes between countries may lead to war.

Several factors make disputes more serious. Serious disputes may do a lot of damage to the people involved, and to their societies.

Disputes may last for long periods, and the longer they last, the more damage they may do. Where disputes involve religions, or hostile countries, they may last for more than a lifetime. Generations of children may be taught that their side is completely right, and the other wrong.

Disputes arise when there are conflicting needs, values or ideas. Differences of religion and culture are a common cause of disputes. Self-interest is a common cause of disputes between individuals.

A second factor is the use of books, newspapers, radio and television by each side to promote their side of the argument. This propaganda helps to continue and spread the dispute.

Laws may prevent freedom of speech, and prevent discussion in print or other media. This makes it difficult for either side to see merit in the other point of view. In turn, this makes it difficult for compromise or tolerance to dissolve the dispute.

The study of disputes and conflicts reached its peak during the Cold War. Then the West versus East conflict seemed to threaten world peace, and many ideas were put forward to use negotiation as a tool to calm the tension. Negotiation about the reduction of nuclear weapons was successful.

The tension was finally reduced by the unexpected end of the Soviet Union, and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe. This was not achieved by negotiation. The reasons for the end of the Soviet Union are still being debated.

Professional help may be available. Between people, there are counsellors; between organisations there are specialists in conflict resolution; between countries there is the United Nations.

Some disputes do fade with the passage of time, though the time may be much longer than a human lifetime. Conflict between religions may fade only after centuries, and there is no known process of mediation.

All legal systems have provisions for making decisions in disputes. Usually the cases are based on claims about money, between individual people or between 'corporate entities'. These are companies or other organisations. Usually, the law can only be used if it can reach a decision based on evidence. Law textbooks list which disputes which may be addressed by law, and which can not.

Force has been used many times to enforce one side of the other to submit. Wars have been based on disputes, or disputes have been used as an excuse for wars. However, force has also been used to keep warring groups apart, and calm people down. Both the European Union and the United Nations have used peace-keeping forces in areas under violent dispute.

Education may be used to harden opinion and make a dispute worse, or it may be used to open people's minds to unpopular ideas. Education which helps people to think for themselves and keep an open mind is thought to reduce prejudice and conflict.

Democracy is one way of easing conflict within a country. It is not a perfect solution, for small groups may feel they are permanently excluded from power. Free speech and freedom from censorship exist to some extent in democracies. These freedoms are valuable to minority groups inside a country. Countries that have these freedoms are called open or liberal democracies.

Of course, there are many disputes between individual people, but disputes between large groups or nations are of very great importance.

Seating capacity is the highest number of people who can sit in a specific space. This limit can be either from the amount of space available, or from a law saying how many people are allowed to be there at a time.

Seating capacity can be for different kinds of things. It can be the number of people who can fit in a vehicle, for example an automobile or an airplane. It can also be for a stadium. The largest sports building in the world, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, has a permanent seating capacity of more than 257,000 people. Seats can be added on the field to raise that number to about 400,000.

Apotropaic magic

Apotropaism or apotropaic magic is the use of magic rituals against evil or harmful influences like the evil eye or "invidia", which was thought to cause injury or bad luck. This can be a long ritual, or it can take the form of simply wearing an amulet or other token, "against bad luck".

Possession Island, Queensland

Possession Island is a small island in the Torres Strait, near Cape York in far northern Queensland, Australia.

The island is called Bedanug or Bedhan Lag by the indigenous Australian people, the Kaurareg people. During his first voyage of discovery James Cook sailed north along the east coast of Australia, landing at Botany Bay. Reaching the tip of Queensland, he named and landed on Possession Island, just before sunset on Wednesday 22 August 1770. He said that the east coast was now British territory under the control of King George III.

He wrote in his journal:

In 2001, the Kaurareg successfully claimed native title rights over the island (and other nearby islands).

Possession Island is located at the centre of the Possession Island National Park. This park has an area of 5.10 km², and was made a protected area in 1977. It is looked after by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.

Commelinaceae

The Commelinaceae is a family of 40 genera and over 600 species of monocotyledonous flowering herbs, distributed from Northern temperate to tropical climates.

Martin Gardner

Martin Gardner (October 21, 1914 – May 22, 2010) was an American writer. He had many interests, so he wrote about many topics. He wrote about mathematics, magic, literature, philosophy, skepticism, and religion. He wrote the "Mathematical Games" column in the "Scientific American" magazine from 1956 to 1981. After that, he wrote the "Notes of a Fringe Watcher" column in the "Skeptical Inquirer" magazine. He published over 70 books.

Gardner also sometimes wrote under pen names. As "Uriah Fuller" he wrote "Confessions of a Psychic". As "George Groth", he criticized his book, "The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener".



Note: Gardner also wrote some books on magic for professional magicians. These books are not listed here.

Martin Gardner's columns from "Scientific American" are printed in 15 books. Don Knuth calls these books "the Canon".

Three other books print some or all of Martin Gardner's columns from Scientific American:


Holes (novel)

Holes is a novel written by Louis Sachar. It was published on August 20, 1998 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, with cover art by Vladimir Radunsky. It won the Newbery Medal in 1999.

The novel is about Stanley Yelnats, a 15-year old boy who is sent by mistake to a camp for young criminals. At the camp, boys must dig 5 foot wide and 5 foot deep holes in a dried up lake in the middle of a hot desert. Stanley starts to have suspicions that the camp's warden is looking for something. This story is told alongside two others stories: one about Stanley's great-great-grandfather, and another about the area where the camp is located. These side stories include links to the present including some of the characters ancestors.

In 2003, Disney released a movie also titled "Holes" which was based on this novel. "Holes" was directed by Andrew Davis and written by the author of "Holes" himself, Louis Sachar. In 2006, Sachar also published a companion novel called "Small Steps", which is about two of the side characters from "Holes". The movie is currently found on Disney+.

Nuclear fuel

Nuclear fuel is a material that can be consumed to take over nuclear energy, by analogy to chemical fuel that is burned for energy. Nuclear fuels are the most dense sources of energy available. 

Most nuclear fuels contain heavy "fissile" elements which to undergo a nuclear fission chain reaction in a nuclear reactor. The most common nuclear fuels are uranium and plutonium but not all nuclear fuels are used in reactors. Some of them power radioisotope thermoelectric generators.


Manicure

A manicure is the act of beautifying one's hands or fingernails. Manicures can be done at home or by a professional in a nail salon.
During a manicure, the nail is filed with a nail file; the free edge of the nail is cut, the cuticle is treated, the person's hand is massaged and nail polish is put on.

5000 years ago, manicures were first used. Henna was used in India for manicure. The word mehendi, another word for henna, derives from the Sanskrit mehandika. Cixi, the Dowager Empress of China, had very long naturally-grown nails.


Dietitian

A dietitian or dietician is an expert in food and nutrition.
Dietitians help promote good health through proper eating. They often write custom diets for people.
In a medical setting they can give food supplements for those people who cannot get what they need because of swallowing problems.
Dietitians want to find, cook and serve tasty, attractive and healthy food to patients, their families and healthcare providers.

In many countries only people with specific degrees or certifications can call themselves dietitians. 
The term nutritionist is widely used as it is not controlled like the title dietitian, but the word nutritionist can be used without having the qualifications of registered dietitians.
A nutritionist is not a dietitian as he is not registered to a national board and does not have the same qualifications.
Dietitians are important in the medical multidisciplinary team because they are experts in nutrition and can give advice to doctors, nurses, and other health care workers.
Dietitians supervise the preparation and service of food, help in research, and teach people on how to eat well.

Mycology

Mycology is the study of fungi. This includes their genetics, their biochemical properties (the chemical processes in them), their classification, their use to humans and their dangers (poisonous or infectious). Fungi are a source of tinder (easily combustible material to light fires), medicines, food, and psychoactive substances. 
A biologist who studies mycology is called a mycologist. 

Mycology is closely related to phytopathology (the study of plant diseases), because most plant diseases are caused by fungi. 
Historically, mycology was a branch of botany (plant biology). Now fungi are thought to be more closely related to animals than to plants.

Fungi are fundamental (perhaps essential) for life on Earth. They are symbionts. They can break down complex organic biomolecules, and so they are a link in the global carbon cycle.

Webster-Hayne debate

The Webster-Hayne debate was a famous debate in the United States between Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts and Senator Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina. It happened on January 19-27, 1830. It was about protectionist tariffs. The speeches between Webster and Hayne themselves were not planned. They had burst forth from arguments about a decision by Connecticut Senator Samuel Foote. Foote had temporarily stopped land surveying until land already on the market was sold. Webster's "Second Reply to Hayne" (1830) was widely seen as "the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress."

Webster described the US government as "made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people". This influenced Abraham Lincoln later. He spoke the words "government of the people, by the people, for the people" in his Gettysburg Address.

Point Hicks

Point Hicks, once called Cape Everard, is a coastal headland on the east coast of Victoria, Australia. It is now a part of the Croajingolong National Park.

Point Hicks is where, on 19 April 1770, the continent of Australia was first sighted by the men on Captain Cook's "Endeavour" voyage. Cook wrote that it was Lieutenant Zachary Hickes who first saw land, and Cook named the point after him. Hickes spelt his name with an "e", Cook wrote both "Hicks" and "Hickes" in different places. The spelling "Hicks" is now in use for the point.

When George Bass sailed past the area at the end of 1797 he did not locate the point. It did not appear on the charts Matthew Flinders made of their voyages, and the name fell into disuse.

The point came to be known as Cape Everard. The first use of that name is said to be by hydrographer John Lort Stokes who surveyed the coast in the "Beagle" in 1843. It is thought he named it after fellow naval officer John Everard Home, but his maps do not use the name.

The first map showing Cape Everard was by surveyor George Douglas Smythe, made in 1852 and published in 1853. If he thought of the name, he may have named it after William Everard, commissioner of crown lands.

The name Cape Everard was used until 1970. There has been doubt and arguments about exactly what Cook saw. The actual latitude and longitude he gave () is a location many miles out to sea.

Point Hicks was renamed as part of Cook's bicentenary. Victorian Premier Henry Bolte announced the new name in a ceremony at the point on 20 April 1970 (this was the 200th anniversary; Cook's 19 April was by nautical time, i.e. not adjusted for the International Date Line).

A lighthouse was built on the point in 1887/8 and started operation in 1890. It was built from concrete and with wooden lighthouse keepers houses. It was connected to mains electricity in 1965, and then to solar power recently. The keepers' cottages are today used as holiday houses. With 37 metres of height it is the tallest lighthouse on Australia's mainland. Its light is a double white flash every ten seconds, from a height of 56 metres above sea level.




Hobo spider

Fethullah Gülen

Muhammed Fethullah Gülen (born 27 April 1941), better known as Fethullah Gülen, is a Turkish preacher, author, educator and Muslim scholar. He lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania, United States. 

Gülen teaches a moderate version of Sunni / Hanafi Islam, derived from Said Nursi's teachings and modernizing them. Gülen condemns terrorism, supports communication between people of different religions, and has initiated dialogue with the Vatican and some Jewish organisations. Until 2013 he was an ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who later blamed him for the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt. He operates a worldwide organisation called the Gülen Movement also known as FETÖ.

Fethullah Gülen's attitude towards hijab has changed over time. In the past, Gülen, who regarded the unwinding of even a strand of women's hair as a great sin, suggested that women should cover their whole body by using veils and gloves. In his last speeches, Gülen evaluated the headscarf as a füruat (minor details).

Creationism: According to Gülen, the Universe is a work of creation that has a purpose, and the purpose of existence is to know Allah and science can gain value if it serves this purpose.

For him, to allow views opposed to belief in creation is a devastating delusion and evolution is a Darwin fallacy.

According to Gülene, the creation of Adam as the first human and Eve from Adam's file bone are miracle creations that should not be addressed in the context of cause-effect relationship.

He wrote his anti-evolutionary ideas in his book "The Truth of Creation and Evolution". This book was prepared by compiling his speeches at the meetings he held against Darwinism and evolution. In the book he states that biology science is a "fantasy" and that the greatest biology fantasy is the theory of evolution.

Thrace

Thrace (: "Thráke"; ; "Trakiya", ) is a historical and geographic area in Southeastern Europe. It was bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, the Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. Thrace included areas that are now southeastern Bulgaria, northeastern Greece, and the European part of Turkey.

The Thracians were an ancient Indo-European people. They lived in Central, Western, and Southeastern Europe.

The indigenous population of Thrace was a people called the Thracians. They were divided into many tribal groups. Thracian troops were known to be used in the Persian army. Many of them went with neighbouring ruler Alexander the Great when he crossed the Hellespont (which is next to Thrace) during his invasion of the Persian Empire.

The Thracians were divided into separate tribes. They did not form a lasting political organization until the Odrysian state was founded in the 4th century BC. Like Illyrians, Thracian tribes of the mountainous regions had a warrior tradition. The tribes based in the plains were more peaceable. Recent funeral mounds in Bulgaria suggest that Thracian kings did rule regions of Thrace with distinct Thracian national identity.

Thrace was conquered by Alexander. It later regained its freedom. It was conquered after several attempts by the Romans in 46 AD, in the reign of Claudius. They became a province, and later four provinces, of the Roman Empire. Finally, as the Empire crumbled, Thrace suffered more than a thousand years of conflict and conquest by stronger forces. It never regained its independence.

The Thracians did not describe themselves as such and "Thrace" and "Thracians" are simply the names given them by the Greeks.

Al Jackson Jr.

Alan "Al" Jackson, Jr. (November 27, 1935 - December 1, 1975) was an American jazz musician and drummer. He formed the funk and jazz group, Booker T. & the M.G.'s.

Jackson was born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1935. He played drums in recording sessions for many other musicians, including Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett. Booker T. & the MG's had several successful records including "Green Onions", "Hip Hug-Her", "Hang 'Em High" and "Time Is Tight".

Jackson was murdered at his home in 1975.

A few months before his death, he was attacked and wounded by his girlfriend and manager, Denise LaSalle.

Jackson was shot dead in his home at 3 am. His wife, who before this had shot him in the chest, said that a burglar came into their house, tied her up, and shot him when he came home. Police said that nothing had been taken from the house, and Jackson's wallet was still on his body. Official investigations ruled out robbery.

Police believe the person who shot Jackson was killed after a gun battle with police on July 15, 1976.

Human penis size

Human penis size is talked about by length and circumference of penis. It is longer than in other primates except for the chimpanzee. The chimpanzee's penis is about the same length. 

The average human erect penis is about in length, the circumference is about . There is no scientific relation between either penis size or race, and shoe size or stretched penis size. At birth the penis is between , at the beginning of puberty, it is 6 cm. Penis size does not change much during adulthood.
A review about penis size was published in 2015 by Veale et al. This review analyzes many studies which published in past 30 years.
By this review the average length of soft(not erect) penis is 9.16 cm, stretched soft penis length is 13.24 cm, erect penis length is 13.12 cm. And the average circumference of soft penis is 9.31 cm and erect penis is 11.66 cm.

In these studies erect penis length is measured from the root of the penis to the tip of the glans along the upper side of the penis. The fat pad at the root of the penis is pushed to the pubic bone. The circumference of the penis is measured at the base or mid-shaft of the penis.


Widespread private concerns have led to a number of folklore sayings and popular culture reflections related to penis size. There is belief that it is possible to predict the size of someone's penis by observing other bodily features such as the hands, feet, nose or height. The media has equated a man's penis size with both power and masculinity. The perception of having a large penis is linked to higher self-esteem.

Many men exaggerate the importance of deep vaginal penetration in stimulating a woman to orgasm. 
The most sensitive area of the female genitals includes the vulva, clitoris, and the section of vagina closest to the outside of a woman's body (G-spot). The vagina is roughly in length. The majority of penises are likely of sufficient length to fully satisfy their partners.

Some women find stimulation of the cervix by penis as uncomfortable or painful, others report it to be key to orgasm. The cervix may be confused with the deepest point of the vagina, above and below the cervix, respectively making it possible for there to be indirect and/or simultaneous stimulation between them. During arousal, the vagina lengthens rapidly to an average of about 10 centimetres, but can continue to lengthen in response to pressure. The walls of the vagina are composed of soft elastic folds of mucous membrane skin which stretch or contract (with support from pelvic muscles) to the size of the penis. With proper arousal, the vagina stretches or contracts to accommodate virtually any size penis, from small to large.

Ancient Romans admired the large penis of Priapus. Ancient Greek art was not obsessed with penis size. A passage from Aristophanes lists broad shoulders, tiny tongue, strong buttocks, and a little penis as the most desirable masculine features. In medieval Arabic literature, a longer penis was preferred, but Afro-Arab author Al-Jahiz wrote: "If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the mule would belong to the (honorable tribe of) Quraysh".

An adult penis with an erect length of less than , but otherwise formed normally, is referred to as having the micropenis condition. Some of the causes are deficiency of pituitary growth hormone and/or gonadotropins, mild degrees of androgen insensitivity, a variety of genetic syndromes, and variations in certain homeobox genes. Some types of micropenis can be addressed with growth hormone or testosterone treatment in early childhood. About 0.6% of males are in the micropenis condition.

Scantron

Scantron is a company from Eagan, Minnesota, USA, that makes and sells machine-readable papers on which students mark answers to test questions, the machines to check those answers, survey and test scoring systems, systems for school attendance (with a mark meaning a missing student) and image-based data collection software and scanners.

A Scantron test scoring system is a multiple-choice, fill-in-the-bubble form. It can have different length and width, from one column, 15-answer tests, to several 8.5×11-inch pages used in standardized testing, such as the SAT and the ACT.

Students often use Scantrons on finals, midterms, standardized tests, such as the SAT and ACT, etc. Students fill in the appropriate bubble corresponding to their answer. Scantrons are then fed through a machine that grades them. The Scantron is a very progressive form of grading. It eliminates human error on the grader's behalf, and takes much less time. 

The technology of this system dates back to the nineteenth century using optical mark recognition, telegraph lines, and punch tape. Students ranging from elementary school through college know how to use these forms. However, Learner Response Systems are becoming more popular in the college setting and may soon make scantrons a thing of the past.

Chickpea

The chickpea "(Cicer arietinum)" is a yellow edible legume (bean). It can be used for cooking. The peas can be bought canned or dried. It was one of the earliest fruits to be grown. The first chickpea was grown in the Middle East about 7,500 years ago. 

The most popular place for chickpeas to grow is in Pakistan. In 2008, nearly 6 million tonnes of chickpeas were produced there. Because the growth is so popular there, it is also known as the Indian pea. 

Chickpeas contain a great deal of protein, zinc and folic acid. They can be an important part of a vegetarian or vegan diet, since they come from a plant. 

The dried bean is boiled and served whole or mashed, such as in the popular dish hummus. Chickpeas are ground into a flour, called "besan" or "gram" flour, used in South Asian cooking.

Hexameter

Hexameter is a metrical line of verse. It is usually made of six parts, called feet. It is the standard verse form used in Ancient Greek and Latin literature. The Iliad and Aeneid use it, and so do Ovid's Metamorphoses. English poetry rarely uses hexameter.

The meter consists of lines made from six ("hex") feet. In strict dactylic hexameter, each of these feet would be a dactyl, but classical meter allows for the substitution of a spondee (two long syllables) in place of a dactyl in most positions. Specifically, the first four feet can either be dactyls or spondees more or less freely. The fifth foot is frequently a dactyl (around 95% of the time in Homer). 

Because of the strong pause at the end of the line, it is traditionally regarded as a spondee. Thus the dactylic line most normally looks as follows:

As in all classical verse forms, the last syllable can actually be short or long.

Viktor Orbán

Viktor Orbán (31 May 1963) is a Hungarian politician who has served as the Prime Minister of Hungary for three non-consecutive terms since 1998. He is the founder and leader of the ruling right-wing party, Fidesz.

Orbán was born on May 31, 1963, in Székesfehérvár, Hungary. He studied law at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest and became involved in politics in the 1980s, when he helped found Fidesz, a youth organization that later evolved into a political party.

Orbán first served as Prime Minister from 1998 to 2002, during which time he implemented a series of economic and social reforms that helped to stabilize Hungary's economy and modernize its infrastructure. He was reelected in 2010 and has since been reelected twice, in 2014 and 2018.

As Prime Minister, Orbán has pursued a populist, nationalist agenda that has been controversial both domestically and internationally. He has been criticized for his crackdown on civil society, media freedom, and academic independence, as well as his handling of the refugee crisis and his opposition to the European Union.

Orbán's government has been accused of corruption and of using its power to undermine democratic institutions and the rule of law. His efforts to centralize power and weaken the judiciary and the media have drawn criticism from the European Union and human rights organizations.

Despite these criticisms, Orbán remains popular among his supporters, who credit him with improving Hungary's economy and promoting its national interests. He has been successful in mobilizing a loyal base of supporters and has built a reputation as a strong, decisive leader.

Orbán's vision for Hungary is based on what he has described as "illiberal democracy," a model of governance that emphasizes national sovereignty, traditional values, and economic self-sufficiency. He has argued that this model is better suited to the challenges of the 21st century than traditional liberal democracy, which he sees as outdated and unsustainable.

Orbán's legacy as a leader is a matter of debate. While he has been credited with bringing stability and prosperity to Hungary, his authoritarian tendencies and controversial policies have raised concerns about the future of democracy and human rights in the country.

Viktor Orbán is a Hungarian politician who has been the country's Prime Minister since 2010. He was born on May 31, 1963, in Székesfehérvár, Hungary, and grew up in a middle-class family. Orbán showed an early interest in politics and was a member of various student organizations during his high school years. He went on to study law at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, where he became involved in anti-communist activism and co-founded the Federation of Young Democrats, a liberal youth organization. After graduation, Orbán began his political career and was first elected to parliament in 1990, following the fall of communism in Hungary.

Viktor Orbán's early political career was defined by his role in the Hungarian democratic opposition and his leadership of the Federation of Young Democrats. In 1988, he was a key figure in organizing a demonstration in Budapest that called for free elections and greater political freedoms. He was first elected to parliament in 1990 and quickly rose through the ranks of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, serving as the party's chairman from 1993 to 2000. Orbán became Prime Minister of Hungary in 1998, following a landslide victory for his conservative Fidesz party. During his first term in office, Orbán pursued a program of economic liberalization and introduced a series of reforms aimed at modernizing Hungary's political and economic institutions.

During his first premiership from 1998 to 2002, Viktor Orbán pursued a pro-market economic policy, implemented tax cuts and privatization measures, and oversaw an increase in foreign investment in Hungary. However, his administration was criticized for its lack of transparency, and Orbán faced accusations of nepotism and corruption. Orbán also pursued a controversial media policy, introducing laws that restricted press freedom and gave the government more control over public media. His administration was also marked by tensions with neighboring countries, particularly Slovakia and Romania, over issues related to Hungarian minority rights. In the 2002 election, Orbán's party was defeated by the Hungarian Socialist Party, and he subsequently went into opposition.

Following his defeat in the 2002 election, Viktor Orbán became the leader of the opposition in the Hungarian parliament. During this period, he worked to reshape his party's image and ideology, moving it away from its previous liberal stance and towards a more conservative, nationalist platform. Orbán also focused on building a stronger party organization and cultivating ties with conservative and populist movements in Europe and the United States. His opposition to the Hungarian Socialist Party government and its austerity measures helped him to regain popularity with voters, and his party won a decisive victory in the 2010 election, returning him to the position of Prime Minister. During his time as opposition leader, Orbán continued to advocate for pro-market economic policies and criticized the government's handling of issues related to national identity and minority rights.

Viktor Orbán began his second term as Prime Minister of Hungary in 2010, following his party's landslide victory in the general election. During his second premiership, Orbán pursued a program of far-reaching constitutional and institutional reforms, which drew criticism from both domestic and international observers. His government implemented a new constitution, which was widely criticized for limiting the power of the judiciary, undermining the independence of the media, and restricting the rights of minorities. Orbán's government also introduced controversial laws regulating media ownership and limiting political advertising. Despite criticism from the European Union and other international bodies, Orbán's Fidesz party remained popular among Hungarian voters, winning a two-thirds majority in the 2014 parliamentary election.

Viktor Orbán is known for his populist and nationalist political views, which prioritize Hungarian interests and emphasize traditional values. His policies have been controversial both domestically and internationally, with critics accusing him of eroding democratic institutions and human rights. Orbán has also been criticized for his government's handling of the refugee crisis and for its perceived authoritarian tendencies. Nevertheless, Orbán remains popular among many Hungarians, who see him as a strong leader who is willing to stand up to foreign influence. His policies have also influenced other populist movements in Europe and beyond, making him a prominent figure on the international stage.

Viktor Orbán was born on May 31, 1963, in Székesfehérvár, Hungary. He is married to lawyer and economist Anikó Lévai, and the couple has five children. Orbán is a devout Catholic and has been active in promoting traditional family values and Christian identity in Hungary. He is also a sports enthusiast, and he played basketball for the Hungarian national team in his youth. Orbán's personal life has been relatively private, and he has not spoken extensively about his hobbies or personal interests.

Vetus Latina

Vetus Latina is the name given to a collection of Biblical texts that were translated into Latin before the Vulgate became the standard version used in the Latin-speaking world. The texts themselves are written in Late Latin, not in Old Latin. They often use different words than the Vulgate. No complete manuscript survives, only fragments are known. Many text passages are known because Church fathers such as Augustine of Hippo cited from them. 

Since the Council of Trent, held in the 16th century, the Vulgate is the official Bible translation for the Roman Catholic Church. 

Some of the Vetus Latin texts survives in the Liturgy, however:
The Old Latin text means, "Glory [belongs] to God among the high, and peace [belongs] to men of good will on earth". The Vulgate text means "Glory [belongs] to God among the most high and peace among men of good will on earth".

Probably the best known difference between the Old Latin and the Vulgate is in the Pater Noster, where the phrase from the Vetus Latina, "quotidianum panem", "daily bread", becomes "supersubstantialem panem", "supersubstantial bread" in the Vulgate.

J. C. Bailey

Joseph Carl Bailey, Jr. (August 23, 1983 – August 30, 2010) was an American professional wrestler. He was better known as J. C. Bailey. He has wrestled for numerous American-based professional wrestling promotions, including Combat Zone Wrestling , IWA Mid-South and IWA East Coast. He has been known as a hardcore wrestler.

Bailey made his debut in 2001. In June 2003, along with the owner of the promotion IWA Mid-South Ian Rotten and Corporal Robinson, he "invaded" CZW on behalf of IWA Mid-South. In the same year, he competed in the 2nd CZW Tournament of Death where he lost to Nick Mondo in a deathmatch involving light tubes, and the 5th IWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch where he lost to Mad Man Pondo after defeating 2 Tuff Tony, Necro Butcher and Ian Rotten.

In 2004, he competed in the 3rd CZW Tournament of Death where he lost to Wifebeater after defeating Chri$ Ca$h, and the 6th IWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch where he lost to Mad Man Pondo and Toby Klein.

Since then, he competed in many deathmatch tournaments including the 4th CZW Tournament of Death, 7th IWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch, 8th IWA Mid-South King of the Deathmatch, 5th CZW Tournament of Death and 6.5th CZW Tournament of Death titled "Fast Forward".

On December 11, 2004, he teamed with Chri$ Ca$h, Nate Webb and Sexxxy Eddy, winning the CZW World Tag Team Championship.

On February 5, 2005, he became the first-ever CZW Ultraviolent Underground Champion. On August 13, 2005, he won his second CZW Ultraviolent Underground Championship.

On September 16, 2006, he competed in the 1st IWA East Coast Masters of Pain where he lost to Jun Kasai after defeating 2 Tuff Tony and Corporal Robinson.

In 2007, Bailey was arrested for stealing a television set from a Bardstown, Kentucky Walmart. He made his official return to CZW in early 2010.

On August 30, 2010, Bailey was found dead. He died in his sleep. Before he died, Bailey complained that he had been getting headaches and numbness in his hands. The cause of his death was later determined to be because of a brain aneurysm that was caused by complications from multiple concussions and traumas to his brain. His brain is expected to be donated for research at Boston University.


Historical rankings of presidents of the United States

Historians (and sometimes political scientists) are surveyed and asked to give presidents of the United States number ratings on their overall performance or on different aspects of their leadership.

Several different factors are considered in deciding what makes one a good or bad president. These include their character, their vision for the country, their relations with congress, their relations with foreign leaders (diplomacy), how they managed the economy, how they managed the military, and their overall political skill.

To make sure the rankings are fair, many surveys equally balance the opinions of Democrats and Republicans.

It is sometimes difficult to accurately rank a president because all of the presidents faced completely different challenges.

Historical opinions of U.S. presidents may change over time. For example, Harry S. Truman had very low approval ratings after he left office, but many historians now consider him among some the greatest presidents.

The following presidents are usually ranked highly:

Some presidents have mixed ratings. For example, Andrew Jackson stood for the common man, but was criticized for implementing the Trail of Tears. Ulysses S. Grant is thought to be a bad leader since he had corruption surrounding him, but he helped African-Americans to have more rights in the Reconstruction Era.

Examples of presidents with mixed opinions include:











Reconstruction era

The Reconstruction was after the American Civil War. It was the remaking of the Southern United States, after it had lost its war of rebellion and slavery was ended. The southern states were occupied territory. Andrew Johnson became President of the U.S. after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. He wanted to make it easy to restore local rule in the previously rebellious states, and he permitted some of them to hold elections in 1865. Former leaders of the Confederate States of America who ran as Democrats were elected to Congress, and states passed laws that denied rights to former slaves.

Many members of the Republican Party wanted stricter terms before local rule was returned to the South. After the Republicans won a large majority of the Congressional seats in the 1866 elections, they refused to let former Confederate leaders take seats in the United States Congress. The Republicans passed laws that former leaders of the rebellion were temporarily denied suffrage, the right to hold office or vote in elections. Three new amendments to the U.S. Constitution were passed that ended slavery, made former slaves citizens, and gave them the right to vote. Some newly freed black slaves won elected offices. Many Northern carpetbaggers also went to the occupied territories to lead the people. Some became rich.

Many white people in the Southern United States resisted allowing former slaves to have equal rights and to vote. The Ku Klux Klan was formed to force black people out of political and economic power. After Reconstruction ended in 1877, white people in the South used their regained political rights to pass Jim Crow Laws. These laws enforced segregation (keeping blacks and whites separate) and took the vote away from African Americans whose parents or grandparents were slaves. After Reconstruction, white Southerners voted mostly for the Democratic Party for about 80 years.

Troodontidae

Troodontidae is a family of bird-like theropod dinosaurs. They were found mainly in Mongolia, China and North America. The first specimen, just a single tooth, was found in central Montana in 1855 by Ferdinand Hayden.

For a long time, troodontid fossils were few and scrappy. Recently more complete specimens have been found. There are now complete and articulated specimens, including feathers, eggs and embryos, and complete juveniles. In 1994 a fossil of an adult "Troodon" was found sitting on a nest with eight eggs.

Anatomical studies of the most primitive troodontids, like "Sinovenator", demonstrate striking similarities with "Archaeopteryx" and primitive dromaeosaurids. This proves they are relatives: they are a clade called Paraves. 

The family have relatively large brains, a skull with many air pockets, a retractable second toe claw (it could be pulled in) and many teeth. The number of teeth ranges from 96 in "Saurornithoides mongoliensis" to 120 in the "Troodon".


Sinovenator

Sinovenator is a small troodontid dinosaur, about the size of a chicken. It is from the early Cretaceous period, 128.2 million years ago. Two fossils were found in the older (lower) portion of the Yixian Formation in China. It was part of the Jehol biota.

The type specimen of "Sinovenator changii" was described in 2002. The specimen is a partial skull and disarticulated skeleton. A second specimen has connected bones, but lacks the skull. Both are in the collection of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, China. 

"Sinovenator" was a basal troodontid. It shares features with the most primitive dromaeosaurids and Avialae. This shows the common descent of these three members of the Paraves. 

Paraves

Paraves is a branch-based clade containing birds (clade Aves) and other closely related dinosaurs. The paravians include the Avialae, such as "Archaeopteryx", and the Deinonychosauria, which includes the dromaeosaurids and troodontids.

The name Paraves was coined by Paul Sereno in 1997. The clade was defined by Sereno in 1998 as a branch-based clade containing all Maniraptora closer to modern birds than to "Oviraptor".

The work of Xu and colleagues provide examples of basal and early paravians with four wings, including members of the Avialae ("Pedopenna"), Dromaeosauridae ("Microraptor"), and Troodontidae ("Anchiornis").

The cladogram presented below follows a study by Zhang and colleagues.

Stan (dinosaur)

Stan is the nickname given to a fossil of the dinosaur species "Tyrannosaurus rex". It was found in Hell Creek Formation, South Dakota, close to Buffalo in 1987 by Stan Sacrison, who also discovered the "Tyrannosaurus" specimen nicknamed "Duffy". The original specimen is housed at the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. 

It is a well known specimen, and one of the most complete, with 199 bones recovered. About 30 casts of the original fossil has been sold worldwide, each for a price of about $100 000. Stan measures 10.9 metres long.


Treponema pallidum

Treponema pallidum is a parasitic spirochaete bacterium. There are different kinds of "Treponema pallidum", which cause diseases like syphilis, bejel, pinta and yaws.

The most common disease caused by "Treponema pallidum" is syphilis, a serious sexually transmitted infection. 

Syphilis is treated and cured by taking antibiotics. Usually, the first treatment used is penicillin. Antibiotic resistance has developed to a number of agents. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, may be as effective as penicillin-based treatment.

Pennicilin is still effective, but "the potential of this spirochete to develop additional antibiotic resistance could seriously compromise syphilis treatment and control".

Persuasion (novel)

Persuasion is Jane Austen's last finished novel.

"Persuasion" is the story of a second chance of lost love. Anne Elliot is the second daughter of Sir Walter Elliot, a proud and foolish baronet. Sir Walter Elliot is a widower with no son, so his land will go to a cousin, William Elliot. Eight years before the story begins, Anne had been engaged to a young naval officer, Frederick Wentworth. However, her mother's friend Lady Russell persuaded her to break off the engagement because he had no fortune. Sadly, she had done so, and Wentworth had angrily left her. Austen writes: "She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older–the natural sequel (following) of an unnatural beginning." Later, Cassandra Austen wrote beside it in her copy of "Persuasion", "Dear, dear Jane! This deserves to be written in letters of gold." Eight years later, her younger sister Mary has married a neighbor, Charles Musgrove. Anne is growing older, her family does not care about her, and she greatly regrets breaking off the engagement.

Sir Walter is forced to stop spending so much money. Therefore, he decides to let his house to Admiral Croft and move to Bath for a while. Anne goes to stay with Mary. Anne discovers that Mrs. Croft, Admiral Croft's wife, is Captain Wentworth's sister. He is introduced to the Musgrove family. He has made much money, and is now a very desirable husband. When he and Anne meet, Anne feels deeply unhappy. He does not seem to care any more about her. He flirts with the two Musgrove sisters. Most people think that he will marry one of them.

They all go to visit Lyme Regis, where Wentworth's friend Captain Harville is staying. Captain Harville had been mourning for his sister, who died young, and comforting Captain Benwick, who had been engaged to marry her. In Lyme, Louisa Musgrove falls from the Cobb while playing with Captain Wentworth on the steps and is seriously injured. Captain Wentworth feels very guilty, and realizes everyone thinks he will marry her if she becomes well again.

Anne joins her father and sister in Bath. They are both being flattered by a widow, Mrs. Clay, the daughter of their family lawyer. William Elliot joins the family. Lady Russell encourages his attentions to Anne, but Anne feels unsure about him. Suddenly, news comes that Louisa is better, and that she and Benwick are engaged.

Wentworth appears in Bath, and becomes jealous of Mr. Elliot. Wentworth believes that Anne and Mr. Elliot are engaged to be married. However, Anne did not answer Mr. Elliot's marriage proposal. She later learns from an old friend, Mrs. Smith, that Mr. Elliot is a bad person. Mr. Elliot is afraid that Sir Walter and Mrs. Clay will have a son, who would then inherit Sir Walter's land. Mr. Elliot wants to marry Anne because he is attracted to her, but also make Mrs. Clay his mistress. Anne is shocked by this news.

Anne and Captain Harville talk about love, and whether women or men love for a longer time. After hearing them talk about this, Wentworth writes a letter to Anne. He tells Anne that he still loves her, and asks her to marry him again. She joyously says yes.


Praetorian Guard

The Praetorian Guard was a force of bodyguards used by Roman Emperors. The title was first used for the guards of generals in the Roman Republic. Their commander, the Praetorian Prefect, was often an important figure in the political planning in Rome. The Guard was stopped and disbanded by Emperor Constantine I in the fourth century AD.

The term "Praetorian" derived from the tent of the commanding general or praetor of a Roman army in the field, known as the "praetorium". It was a habit of many Roman generals to choose from the ranks a private force of soldiers to act as guards of their person. This elite group of Roman citizens consisted of both infantry and cavalry. In time, this cohort came to be known as the "cohors praetoria", and various notable figures had one of those guard groups, including Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and Augustus (Octavian). 

As Caesar discovered with the 10th Legion "Equestris", a powerful mounted unit was desirable in the field. When Augustus became the first ruler of the Roman Empire in 27 BC, he decided such a formation was useful not only on the battlefield but in politics also. Thus, from the ranks of the legions throughout the provinces, Augustus recruited the Praetorian Guard. 

Through the cunning of their ambitious prefect, Sejanus, the Guard was brought from their Italian barracks into Rome itself. In AD 23, Sejanus convinced Tiberius to have the Praetorian fort built just outside Rome. One of the cohorts held the daily guard at the imperial palace. Henceforth the entire Guard was at the disposal of the emperors, but the rulers were now equally at the mercy of the Praetorians. The reality of this was seen in AD 31 when Tiberius was forced to rely upon his own "cohors praetoria" against partisans of Sejanus. Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius, their potential political power had been made clear.

While campaigning, the Praetorians were the equal of any formation in the Roman Army. Seldom used in the early reigns, they were quite active by AD 69. Under Domitian and Trajan, the guard took part in wars from Dacia to Mesopotamia, while with Marcus Aurelius, years were spent on the Danube frontier. Throughout the 3rd century, the Praetorians assisted the emperors in various campaigns.

The relationship between the Guard and their Emperor was always sensitive. Bribing the Guard was a common theme in Imperial history. Sejanus almost took over the running of the Empire, before Tiberius overcame, and later executed, him. A number of Roman Emperors were murdered or otherwise deposed by the Guard, or with their knowledge. The first was Caligula.

Non-penetrative sex

Non-penetrative sex is a form of sexual activity which does not involve penetration of the vagina, anus, or mouth, unlike doing penetration in sex. 
Medical professionals accept the term of non-penetrative sex. It is a way to practice safer sex and of birth control as bodily fluids are not exchanged between partners. The form of sex is practised between partners who do not feel ready, are not physically able, cannot or simply do not want to have socially appropriate penetrative sex, but still wish to do a sexual act.

Greatest common divisor

The greatest common divisor (gcd) or highest common factor (HCF) of two integers "x" and "y", usually written as formula_1, is the greatest (largest) number that divides both of the integers evenly. GCDs are useful in simplifying fractions to the lowest terms. Euclid came up with the idea of GCDs.

The GCD of any two positive integers can be defined as a recursive function: formula_2

In fact, this is the basis of Euclidean algorithm, which uses repeated long division in order to find the greatest common factor of two numbers.

The GCD of 20 and 12 is 4, since 4 times 5 equals 20 and 4 times 3 equals 12. And since 3 and 5 have no common factor, their GCD is 1.

As another example, the GCD of 81 and 21 is 3.

Power of two

In mathematics, a power of two is any number which is an integer power of two. Powers of two are important in binary just as powers of ten (like 1, 10, 100, etc.) are important in decimal. The numbers one less than powers of two are called Mersenne numbers.

Piecewise function

In mathematics, a piecewise function is a function that is defined using multiple rules. Each rule specifies the function values for a portion of the domain, and the rules are conjoined together using the formula_1 symbol. For example, there might be a function which gives formula_2 when formula_3, and formula_4 when formula_5.

The absolute value function, floor function and step function are some common functions which are usually defined piecewise.


Elgin Marbles

The Elgin Marbles or Parthenon Marbles are a series of ancient Greek sculptures of relief made from marble. They were originally part of the Parthenon temple in Athens but they were taken by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin in the early 1800s. 

Many people, including the Greek government, have argued that Elgin stole the marbles and did not take them legally. They are on display in the British Museum. The Greek government asked to have them back many times. In 2014 UNESCO offered to mediate but the museum declined. 
In Britain, the acquisition of the collection was supported by some, while others, such as Lord Byron, likened Elgin's actions to vandalism or looting. A UK parliamentary inquiry in 1816 decided that Elgin had got the marbles legally. Elgin sold them to the British government in that year, after which they passed into the trusteeship of the British Museum.

Mockumentary

A mockumentary is a movie that pretends to be a documentary. It pretends to tell a true story, but is really a work of fiction. The word is a combination (a portmanteau word) of "mock" (meaning fake or false) and "documentary". 


Waiting for Guffman

Waiting for Guffman is a musical mockumentary movie made in 1997. It was directed by Christopher Guest, who also stars in the movie. The movie is set in the small town of Blaine, Missouri, which is not a real town. The town decides to perform a musical called "Red, White and Blaine" to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the town, and invites a famous theater critic named to see it, hoping that he will make the play famous.

The name of the movie is a reference to the play "Waiting for Godot" by Samuel Beckett. In that play, the two main characters are waiting for a man named Godot, who never shows up. In "Waiting for" , never shows up, either.URL

Abundant number

An abundant number is a number formula_1 for which its sum of divisors is greater than formula_2. 12 is an abundant number because formula_3.
18 is also an abundant number because formula_4. The series is in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (Sloane) as . 945 is the first odd abundant number.

If a number is not abundant, it is called either deficient or perfect.

Ant mill

An ant mill is a small group of army ants away from the other ants. They lose the pheromone track and begin to follow each other, making a spinning circle. This circle is also known as a "death spiral" because the ants will eventually die of exhaustion. People can make this happen easily. This is a side effect of the self organizing structure of ant colonies. Each ant only knows to follow the ant in front of it. This will work until something goes wrong and an ant mill forms. An ant mill was first seen by William Beebe who saw a mill 1,200 feet in circumference. It took each ant 2.5 hours to go around.

Acanthomyops

Lady-in-waiting

A lady-in-waiting (also called waiting maid) is a female personal helper at a noble court. A lady in waiting would be in charge of waking, dressing and accompanying a lady in her daily activities She helps a queen, a princess, or other noblewoman. A lady-in-waiting is often a noblewoman of a lower rank than the one she attends. She is not thought to be a servant. Their duties are different depending on the court. People with artistic talents were usually chosen. In Russia, girls between "fourteen or twenty ["sic"]" were chosen, and left the court when she married. People like Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr were all ladies-in-waiting.

Medical microbiology

Medical microbiology, also known as ‘’’clinical microbiology’’’, is the study of microbes, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, which cause human illness and their role in the disease.

The microbes and the branch of microbiology are the most studied due to their great importance to medicine.

Medical microbiology studies development and progress of the infectious disease in a patient and in human population (epidemiology). It is related to the study of disease pathology and immunology. It is a branch of medicine and microbiology and includes five sciences: bacteriology, virology, parasitology, immunology and mycology.

In 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused by transferable seed like entities through direct, indirect contact and contact over long distances with an infection.

Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch are the founders of medical microbiology. Louis Pasteur is famous for his experiments when he disproved the theory of spontaneous generation. He offered method for food preservation (pasteurization) and vaccines against anthrax, fowl cholera and rabies. Robert Koch contributed to the germ theory of disease, provided that specific diseases were caused by specific microbes. He developed criteria known as the Koch's postulates and was among first to isolate bacteria in pure culture resulting in his description of several bacteria including "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", the causative agent of tuberculosis.


A medical microbiologist is a specialist in medical (clinical) microbiology.

He provides clinical consultations on the investigation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients suffering from infectious diseases. He establishes and directs infection control programs across public health care, infectious disease prevention and epidemiology.

He provides the scientific and administrative direction of a clinical microbiology laboratory. Such laboratory receives almost any clinical specimen, including swabs, feces, urine, blood, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, possible infected tissue. The work here is mainly concerned with cultures, to look for suspected pathogens which, if found, are identified based on biochemical tests. In addition, sensitivity testing is carried out to determine whether the pathogen is sensitive or resistant to a suggested medicine. Results are reported with the identified organism(s) and the type and amount of drug(s) that should be prescribed for the patient.

Medical microbiologist is also involved in teaching at all levels, and in research. It provided the development of vaccines against invading organisms. Deadly and debilitating diseases such as small pox, polio, and tuberculosis have been either eradicated or become more treatable.
There are claims that consuming probiotics (bacteria potentially beneficial to the digestive system) and/or prebiotics (substances consumed to promote the growth of probiotic microorganisms) contributes to human health. Microorganisms could be useful in the treatment of cancer. Strains of non-pathogenic clostridia can infiltrate and replicate within solid tumors, deliver therapeutic proteins.

Neoclassicism

Neoclassicism is the name given to movements in the arts that draw upon Western classical art and culture (usually that of Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome). Traditionally, Classicism is about the art made in antiquity (very long ago, in ancient times) or later art inspired by that of antiquity. But Neoclassicism is always about the art made later but inspired by antiquity. So, Classicism and Neoclassicism are often used together. It often means clearness, elegance, harmony, and rest made by careful attention to traditional forms.

Examples of Neoclassicism in architecture include the White House and Neue Wache.

Robert Todd Lincoln

Robert Todd Lincoln (August 1, 1843 – July 26, 1926) was an American lawyer and Secretary of War. He was the first son of President Abraham Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln. Born in Springfield, Illinois, United States, he was the only one of Lincoln's four sons to live to be an adult. He was a bright lawyer, and mostly served railroad interests. He was (1897–1911) president of the Pullman Company. He was quiet and shy. Because of this, he never tried to be a president, but he was minister to Great Britain (1889–93). Most of his last 20 years were spent at Hildene, his estate near Manchester, Vermont.

Lincoln did not have a very close relationship with his father. This was partly because Abraham Lincoln often spent months away from home. Robert would later say his clearest memory of his father was when he was packing for a trip to Illinois. Abraham Lincoln was proud of Robert. He thought Robert was clever. Though they were not close, Robert respected and loved his father. He wept openly at his deathbed.

Following his father's assassination, in April 1865, Robert Lincoln moved with his mother and his brother Tad to Chicago, where Robert completed his law studies at the Old University of Chicago (a school different from but later assumed by the university presently known by that name). He was admitted to the bar on February 25, 1867.

Lincoln was also present during the assassinations of James A. Garfield and William McKinley. He is the only man to have been present in the area where three US Presidents were assassinated.

On September 24, 1868, Robert Lincoln married Mary Eunice Harlan (September 25, 1846 – March 31, 1937). They had two daughters and one son. The last person who was directly related to Lincoln was Robert's grandson "Bud" Beckwith. He died in 1985.

Sejanus

Sejanus (Lucius Aelius Seianus 20 BC – October 18, AD 31), was an ambitious soldier, friend and confidant of the Roman Emperor Tiberius. An equestrian by birth, Sejanus rose to power as Praetorian Prefect. He commanded the Roman imperial bodyguard, the Praetorian Guard, from AD 14 until his death in 31.

After the Praetorian Guard was established under Augustus, Sejanus introduced reforms which saw the unit go from a mere bodyguard to an influential branch of the government. It controlled public security, and influenced civil administration. Most important of all, it influenced the succession of emperors: all needed the goodwill and support of the Guard. These changes would have a lasting impact on the Empire.

During the 20s, Sejanus gradually accumulated power by influencing Tiberius and eliminating potential political opponents, including the emperor's son, Drusus. When Tiberius withdrew to Capri in 26, Sejanus was left in control of the entire state mechanism as "de facto" ruler of the empire. For a time the most influential and feared citizen of Rome, Sejanus suddenly fell from power in 31, the year his career culminated with the consulship. Amidst suspicions of conspiracy against Tiberius, Sejanus was arrested and executed, along with his followers.

In 29 Sejanus began a series of purge trials of senators and rich equestrians in the city, removing those capable of opposing his power, adding to the imperial (and his own) treasury. Networks of spies and informers brought the victims to trial with false accusations of treason, and many chose suicide over the disgrace of being condemned and executed. Only Caligula, the last remaining son of Germanicus, managed to survive the purges of Sejanus. He had moved to Capri to be with Tiberius in 31.

Through years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor, Sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the empire. Exactly what caused his sudden downfall is unclear: According to Josephus, it was Antonia, the mother of Livilla, who finally alerted Tiberius to the growing threat Sejanus posed. She sent a letter to Capri in the care of her freedman Pallas.

By the end of 31, he would be arrested, summarily executed. His body unceremoniously cast down the Gemonian stairs, which were a flight of steps in the ancient city of Rome. Nicknamed the Stairs of Mourning, they are infamous in Roman history as a place of execution. 

It was done like this. Tiberius resigned his post of Consul, which forced Sejanus to do likewise. This removed much of Sejanus' legal powers and protection. Another man, Macro, was appointed as Praetorian Prefect. Sejanus was summoned to a meeting of the Senate, where a letter from Tiberius was read condemning Sejanus and ordering his immediate execution. 
Following an issue of "damnatio memoriae" by the Senate, his statues were torn down and his name obliterated from public records. Although Rome at first rejoiced at the death of Sejanus, the city quickly plunged into more extensive trials, as Tiberius relentlessly persecuted all those who could in any way be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship. This included all the children of Sejanus.

Al Jolson

Al Jolson (May 26, 1886 – October 23, 1950) was a Lithuanian-American Jewish singer, comedian, actor, and vaudevillian. His career lasted from 1911 until his death in 1950. He was called "the world's greatest entertainer”. 

His singing style was "sentimental [and] melodramatic". This style made many songs popular. Jolson influenced many famous singers. Some of these singers were Bing Crosby Judy Garland, rock and country entertainer Jerry Lee Lewis, and Bob Dylan. Dylan said Jolson was "somebody whose life I can feel".

Jolson was America's most famous and highest paid entertainer in the 1930s. Jolson sang and acted in the first (full length) talking movie, "The Jazz Singer" in 1927. He starred in many other musical movies in the 1930s. A movie about Jolson's life, "The Jolson Story", won Oscars in 1946. Larry Parks played Jolson, but Jolson sang the songs himself. A sequel, "Jolson Sings Again," was released in 1949, and was nominated for three Oscars. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Jolson became the first star to entertain troops overseas during World War II. Again in 1950 became the first star to perform for GIs in Korea. He did 42 shows in 16 days.

He sometimes performed in blackface makeup. This was a theatrical convention in the mid-19th century. With his unique and dynamic style of singing black music, like jazz and blues, he was later credited with single-handedly introducing African-American music to white audiences. As early as 1911 he became known for fighting against anti-black discrimination on Broadway. Jolson's well-known theatrics and his promotion of equality on Broadway helped pave the way for many black performers, playwrights, and songwriters, including Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, and Ethel Waters.

Zhytomyr

Zhytomyr () is a city in Ukraine, the administrative center of Zhytomyr Oblast. Nearly 271 000 people live here ().

Zhytomyr is a big transportation center. The city lies on a historic way that connects the city of Kyiv with the west through Brest. Today it connects Warsaw with Kyiv, Minsk with Izmail, and several major cities of Ukraine. Zhytomyr was also the location of Ozerne, an important Cold War strategic plane base that was situated southeast of the city.

Zhytomyr is divided into two districts. It is located on the Teteriv River.

As a legend says, Zhytomyr was founded about 884 by Zhytomyr, prince of a Slavic tribe of Drevlians. This date, 884, is cut in the large stone of the ice age times, that stands on the hill where it was founded.

 

Media center

The term media center refers either to a dedicated computer appliance or to a specialized application software designed to run on standard personal computer hardware which then becomes a so called ""HTPC"" (""Home Theater PC"", also sometimes referred to as a ""Media PC""), both of which are adapted for playing various kinds of media (music, movies, photos etc.). A media center usually has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) designed to be used with a living-room TV using a remote control. This remote control is commonly known by their designers as a 10-foot user interface. A media center typically allows one to watch movies (DVD, Blu-ray, and other digital video formats) and watching and recording television broadcasts, playing audio (CD as well as MP3, WMA, and other audio formats).

The media itself may be stored, received by terrestrial, satellite or cable broadcasting or streamed from the internet. Stored media is kept either on a local hard drive or on a (wireless) network attached storage. Some software is capable of doing other tasks, such as finding news (RSS) from the Internet. Media centers are often operated with a remote control, connected to a television set for video output, and can sometimes function as a normal personal computer.

A media center can be purpose-built, modified or created individuals by adding media center software to a PC or some other computer, for example a Home Theater PC or an Xbox. Lately, some video game consoles (such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360) with their network services can also act as a basic media center device by default.

Typically, complete media centers offer the following functions to the user:


Though media centers are often built using similar components to personal computers, they are often smaller; media centers sometimes have hardware that is not usually seen in personal computers, such as receivers for remote controls, or television tuner cards. Media centers have not seen widespread popularity but are starting to take hold in the UK and the United States.

There are several common applications for which media centers are beginning to gain popularity. Simply put, any application requiring the playback of digital media based files, but not requiring the full features and flexibility of a personal computer stands to benefit from the reduced size, reduced complexity and reduced cost of media centers when compared to similarly equipped PCs.

Common applications include :




Doctor-patient relationship

The relationship between a doctor and a patient is a very important part of medicine. Only when there is a good relationship between the two is it possible to have high-quality healthcare. This relationship is also at the base of medical ethics. Many medical schools teach the doctors to be to keep a professional relationship with their patients, to respect the patients' dignity and privacy. 

This relationship has asymmetric information though. The doctor knows more than the patient, but has to explain the patient's situation, and has to ask the patient what treatments should be done. There is a very similar relationship between the patient and nurses, psychologists.

There are different legal norms that regulate this relationship. Examples of such norms are the Hippocratic oath, the Declaration of Geneva. Professional responsibility may also govern such a relationship.

Ideally, patient and doctor trust each other. If they do, this can have a positive influence on the development of disease or condition. Healing can be hindered if the patient does not take the prescribed drugs, of if these drugs are not taken in the doses prescribed.

If the relationship is too good this can preclude efficiency. In certain cases, it may be good to get the opinion of a second doctor, regarding a condition.


Corm

A corm is a modified plant stem some plants use as a storage organ or for hibernation. Corms are structurally plant stems, and can produce roots. On the top of the corm, one or a few buds grow into shoots that produce normal leaves and flowers.

Some plants with corms regularly replace their older corms with a stack of younger ones. In other species their corms simply grow larger in most seasons. Yet others split when multiple buds or stolons on a large corm sprout independently.

Corms can be dug up and used to multiply or redistribute the plant (see, for example, taro). Plants with corms generally can be propagated by cutting the corms into sections and replanting. 

Plants that form corms include the following species:

Army ant

Army ant (or legionary ant or "Marabunta") means over 200 ant species. They are called army ants due to their aggressive predatory groups looking for food, known as "raids", in which many ants look for food at the same time in one place, attacking other animals collectively.

Army ants do not build a nest like most other ants. Instead, they build a living, temporary nest with their bodies. All army ant species are part of the ant family, Formicidae. There are several kinds that have evolved on their own the same behavior. This is called "legionary behavior", and is convergent evolution.

Before, "army ant" meant ants from 5 different ant subfamilies: in two of these subfamilies, the Ponerinae and Myrmicinae, it is only a few species that show legionary behavior; in the other three subfamilies, Ecitoninae, Dorylinae, and Leptanillinae, "all" of the species are legionary. Now, another subfamily Leptanilloidinae, is called army ants.

A 2003 study of thirty species (by Sean Brady of Cornell University) shows that the ecitonine and doryline army ants evolved from one group in the mid-Cretaceous period in Gondwana, and so the two subfamilies are now one called Ecitoninae, but not everyone says this.

These are army ants:









Hematuria

Hematuria is the presence of blood in the urine. It may have a benign cause, but in some cases can be caused by an illness that could cause death. 


Bladder cancer

Bladder Cancer is cancer arising in the Urinary bladder. It is much more common in men than in women. People who are between 65 to 74 years are mostly affected by this disease.

Streptococcus mutans

Streptococcus mutans is a gram-positive bacteria that lives in the mouth. This bacteria grows optimally in the range of 18-40 degrees Celsius. The microbe was first described by Clarke in 1924.

Commutative property

The commutative property says that the order of the numbers when adding or multiplying can be changed without changing the answer. For example, both formula_1 and formula_2 are equal to 10, and both formula_3 and formula_4 are equal to 35. This can be done with any numbers, or with more than two numbers.
The definition of commutative property of addition is formula_5. "a" and "b" are variables and can be any number.

Some operations like dividing are not commutative. For instance, formula_6 is 2, but formula_7 is formula_8. Subtraction is not commutative either: formula_9 is 4, but formula_10 is negative 4.

In higher mathematics like calculus, there are other commutative operations besides adding and multiplying. Commutative property must hold for each two elements of an Abelian group.

Irrational number

In mathematics, an irrational number is a real number that cannot be written as a complete ratio of two integers. 

An irrational number cannot be fully written down in fraction or decimal form. It would have an infinite number of digits. In addition, these digits would also not repeat. The set of irrational numbers is sometimes written as formula_1 or formula_2. 
Irrational numbers often occur in geometry. For instance, if a square has sides of 1 meter, the distance between opposite corners is the square root of two meters. This is an irrational number. In decimal form it is written as 1.414213... Mathematicians have proved that the square root of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number.

One well known irrational number is pi (π). This is the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter. This number is the same for every circle. The number pi is approximately 3.14159265358979323… .

Other examples of irrational number include the numbers formula_3 and formula_4. A number for which irrationality is not known is the Euler–Mascheroni constant formula_5.

Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway

The Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway (the O.I.R.) was a standard gauge railway that served an ironstone quarry near the village of Wroxton in Oxfordshire. It linked to the Great Western Railway about to the east, just north of the town of Banbury. Both the quarry and line opened in 1917 and closed in 1967, when the Ironstone ran out. It never became part of British Rail and was run by the quarry's owners.

The quarry was heavily worked in the Second World War, due to extra war needs. A newer quarry close by is now served by trucks only.

The OIR operated its own fleet of steam locomotives: 0-6-0T, 0-6-0ST and 0-4-0ST's.

Lee Myung-bak

Lee Myung-bak () ; born 19 December 1941) was President of South Korea from 2008 to 2013. He was the CEO of Hyundai Engineering and Construction. In 2002 Lee declared his candidacy for Seoul Mayor, and won the election. After he became president, he said, "I will give Seoul a complete makeover." He was elected the President of South Korea on 19 December 2007. This was the same day as his birthday. It was also the same day he married his wife, Kim Yoon-ok. So, on their 37th wedding anniversary and his 67th birthday, Lee became President of South Korea. He finished his service in February 2013. Lee has three daughters and one son.

Lee Myung-bak was born on December 19, 1941 in Japan. After the end of World War II in 1945, his family came back to his father's hometown Pohang, Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea. Lee went to night school at Dongji Commercial High School.

On March 26, 2010 an explosion destroyed the South Korean warship Cheonan. This killed 40 men. Six men also disappeared. They are thought to be dead. An investigation into the sinking blamed North Korea. They said that a torpedo fired by a North Korean submarine had sunk the ship. North Korea said it had nothing to do with the Cheonan's sinking. They said they were not guilty. Lee said their denial was "laughable". He stopped all trade between the north and south. He also asked the United Nations to help them against North Korea. He also began sending radio messages to North Korean people.

Lee Myung-bak is a Christian and goes to the Somang Presbyterian church. When he was a mayor, he once declared that Seoul was a "holy place governed by God". He has been much criticized for his beliefs. Buddhist people protested that Lee was a threat to their religion.

Lee has also been criticized for not giving enough political freedom to the people. For example, the police limited demonstrations. But Lee said, "I fully understand the protestors' point of view on the matter". He added, "Protesting culture has a deep root in democracy of Korea and despite the ongoing political upheaval of this country, the enthusiasm that the protesters showed is one embrace (approve) and this a positive (good) drive of Korea's development."

FC Augsburg play in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system. The team was founded as Fußball-Klub Alemania Augsburg in 1907 and played as BC Augsburg from 1921 to 1969. With over 18,800 members, it is the largest football club in Swabian Bavaria.

The team was founded as Fußball-Klub Alemania Augsburg in 1907 and played as BC Augsburg from 1921 to 1969. The merging of the clubs TSV Schwaben and BC Augsburg was discussed since the late 1940s. In 1969 BC Augsburg had problems in the 3rd division and so had TSV Schwaben. The new FCA played its first game on 30 July 1969, when it met 1. FC Nuremberg in Augsburg in front of 13,000 and lost 3-0 in extra time.

After the formation of the club in 1969, the club played mostly in the 2nd and 3rd division of German football. From 1983 to 1994 they played in Bavaria's highest league, the Bayernliga. At this time it was the third division of league football in Germany. From 1994 to 2000 they played in the Regionalliga Süd which was the name of the new 3rd stage of German league system. In 2006/07 they played for the first time in the 2.Bundesliga and in the 2010/11 season they reached the second place. They were promoted to the German Bundesliga.

Augsburg's kits are predominantly white, with red and green kits also appearing from time to time.

Phonon

In physics, a phonon is a quantized lattice vibration. The word quantized is used in physics to mean that only certain values of something are allowed. Something that is quantized can be thought of as stairs; you can only move from step to step and you can't stand in between steps. Something that is not quantized can be thought of as a ramp or smooth incline; you can move any distance up or down. A lattice is the repeating or periodic structure of a crystal. A crystal is made up of atoms or molecules in a certain pattern. The points on the pattern at which the atoms or molecules are located is the lattice. Solids, liquids, and gases can all experience vibrations. A vibration being quantized means that only certain frequencies of vibrations are allowed.

Intuitively, there is no reason for lattice vibrations to be quantized. The macroscopic or large-scale vibrations of a material are not quantized and can take on essentially any frequency. It is only when we consider the tiny vibrations of the particles that make up a material—atoms and molecules—that the concept of quantization and phonons becomes important. To understand why phonons exist, complicated quantum mechanics is needed. Without going into too much detail, the interactions between the constituent atoms or molecules of a crystal are analyzed quantum mechanically. Because of their arrangement in a pattern that repeats, when one arrives at a mathematical expression for the frequency of oscillation, one finds that there are only distinct quantized values allowed.

Thunder Bay Thunder Cats

The Thunder Bay Thunder Cats was the name of the Rockford IceHogs of the UHL (now the International Hockey League) prior to moving to Rockford. The team went through a number of different names prior to being the Thunder Cats, including the Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks and the Thunder Bay Senators.

After the success of the 5-time Allan Cup champion Thunder Bay Twins, the Colonial Hockey League took interest in expanding to the Northwestern Ontario city. In 1991, the Colonial league introduced the Thunder Bay Thunder Hawks, spelling the end of the 21-year Twins franchise that stepped aside for the new Semi-Pro team. In 1993, the team changed its name to the Thunder Bay Senators to reflect the teams affiliation with the National Hockey League's Ottawa Senators. Soon after, the CoHL changed its name to the United Hockey League and in 1996 the team became the Thunder Bay Thunder Cats.

After eight seasons in Thunder Bay, the Thunder Cats were bought, moved to Rockford, Illinois, and renamed the Rockford IceHogs in 1999.


Parser

In computer science, a parser is a program that checks to see if a text is valid according to the rules of a grammar.

Lymington Branch Line

The Lymington branch line is a short line running between Brockenhurst and Lymington Pier. The line is operated by South West Trains. There is a station in between called Lymington Town. The short length of track between Lymington Town and Lymington Pier has a line speed of 20mph.

The two preserved 421cig units make the line a popluar destination for rail-fans. Unit 1497 "Freshwater" was painted in British Rail White and Blue while 1498 "Farringford" was painted in BR Green. The units were given names of places on the Isle of Wight as they only ran on this line. Until 22 May 22 2010 they were the only EMU slamdoor units still in operation anywhere in Britain.

The line is now operated by 158/9 sprinter units. This means the 750Volt DC electric has no longer got a use. This may seem strange as most parts of the country are electrifiying lines. The reason for this is that "450 units" have 4 cars which are too long for Lymington Town Station. And South West Trains are not willing to remove a coach from a 450 unit. The only solution then is to use DMU 3 car sprinter units.

HQ9+

HQ9+ is a joke programming language made by Cliff L. Biffle in 2001. It has four "operations":


Quine (computing)

A quine is a special kind of computer program, which accepts no inputs and outputs its own source code. They are named after the philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine.

Quine was very interested in the "liar paradox", "this statement is false", which can't be either true or false. This paradox appears in lots of other places. In the mathematics of set theory it is called Russell's paradox, it is a set which contains sets which don't contain themselves. 

All of those examples before Quine were 'self-referential'. This means that they define an object in terms of itself, like the liar paradox starting with the words "this statement". Lots of people thought that you could ignore the liar paradox if you just decided to ignore all self-referential statements. Quine saw that you would also have to ignore "quotation", which is the process that happens when you put a phrase in quote marks. When you "say" a phrase, you are talking about its meaning; but when you "quote" a phrase, you are talking about that phrase, and not what it means.

Quine's paradox was, '"Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation" yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.' This is a more complicated liar paradox which is not self-referential. It is a simple statement about some phrase, telling you what happens when you write a statement where you write the phrase in quote marks and then write the phrase again outside of them.

Most programming languages have quotation too: you can put quotes around some code and then the computer does not "run" that code, but instead just "stores" it as a string.

The trick to writing a quine involves writing a string which somehow has a "hole" in it, then outputting that string, with the "hole" filled in with its own quotation. For example in Python the function which quotes a string is called codice_1, and the codice_2 operator fills in a hole which is written as codice_3 in the string, while converting codice_4 to codice_2:
def quine():
Or in JavaScript, we can use codice_6 to quote an array, and the "hole" can be the space between the two array elements:
function quine() {
In CoffeeScript you can write a quine as a phrase followed by its own quotation, which looks a lot like Quine's paradox:
quine = -> ((t) -> t + JSON.stringify t) "quine = -> ((t) -> t + JSON.stringify t) "

ELIZA

ELIZA is an early program able to process natural language. ELIZA operated by processing users' responses to "scripts". The most famous script was called DOCTOR. It was a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist. Eliza didn't know much about thought or emotion. However, DOCTOR sometimes provided conversation like a human. ELIZA was written at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966.

When the person used words that were not in the very small list,
DOCTOR might say, for example, responding to "My head hurts", "Why do you say your head hurts?" The response to "My mother hates me" might be "Who else in your family hates you?" ELIZA was programmed using simple pattern matching techniques, but was taken seriously by several of its users, even after Weizenbaum explained to them how it worked. It was one of the first chatterbots in existence.





GNU Emacs

GNU Emacs (short for Editing Macros) is thought to be text editor that is common on many UNIX-based operating systems, Mac and Windows Operating systems but it's actually a extendable elisp editor that can be made to be just about anything 

Emacs is primarily used by just about everyone from programmers to home desktop users. This is because emacs can do just about anything you can think of. Some of the uses of Emacs include:

Emacs is made powerful by Emacs Lisp, a built-in programming language that lets the user extend the capabilities of the editor.

A common Emacs joke is that all of the functions of the editor are crazy weird keystrokes (such as "control-meta-4 shift-left-P-semicolon-F1" to do something simple like cut and paste text). In reality, though, these keystrokes are relatively simple, though they can take some getting used to.

There is an Internet turf war between programmers that prefer Emacs and programmers that prefer Vim (or Vi), another common text editor.

Bacillus anthracis

Bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium, 11.2µm in width and 3–5µm in length. It is the agent which causes anthrax.

The bacillus lives in soils worldwide at moderate temperatures. It can be grown in aerobic or anaerobic conditions (it is a facultative anaerobe) in a medium with essential nutrients, including carbon and nitrogen sources. In 1877, this organism was the first to be shown to cause disease by Robert Koch and verified by Louis Pasteur.

George Bancroft

George Bancroft (October 3, 1800 – January 17, 1891) was an American historian and statesman. He was important in promoting secondary education both in his home state and at the national level. He made the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1845. Among his best-known writings is "History of the United States, from the Discovery of the American Continent". He was known as the "father of American History". He was born into a Whig family. Later his studies led him to become a Democratic.

Christadelphians

The Christadelphians are a Christian denomination that developed in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 19th century. Other names for them include Brothers of Christ and Christ's Brethren. They were in effect founded by John Thomas, but do not consider him greater than any other teacher. Today, there are about 55,000-60,000 Christadelphians. Many of them live in Britain, Australia, Africa and the United States.

Their ideas are close to other Restorationist movements such as the Anabaptist movement. They say that when Christianity came in contact with the Hellenic world, it was spoiled. Therefore, they only accept teachings that can be found in the Bible. They think that the Bible was inspired by God and they accept no other texts. 

Today almost all Christadelphians belong to the main "Central" fellowship. But, following some disagreements, there have been different groups of Christadelphians. Among those still in existence today are Unamended Fellowship which has 1,800 members in North America, the Dawn Fellowship, and the Berean Fellowship.

They do not have priests or pastors, instead each local church has a group of elders who are chosen by the members each year. Most male members take turns to speak each week.

Gaza flotilla raid

The Gaza flotilla raid happened on 31 May 2010. It was in the international waters of the Mediterranean Sea. Israeli naval forces seized an aid flotilla of six ships carrying 663 or 682 pro-Palestinian activists from 37 nations, known as the "Gaza Freedom Flotilla". The activists were trying to breach the blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian supplies. 
During the event, Israeli military forces seized a convoy of six ships carrying goods which should be brought to the Palestinian territories in the form of aid. There were 663-682 people on board these ships. The ships were headed to the port of Gaza. Israel had offered them to land at a different port, so that the aid could be inspected, but the crew had declined this offer. During the incident, at least nine people were killed.

The Gaza strip is part of Palestine. It is amongst the most densely populated areas on Earth. About 1.5 million people live on a surface of roughly 493 km².

The Palestinian Authority says that this is an occupied territory. They say, Israel is the occupation force, and it should withdraw, and give the territory back to the Palestinians. Israel has attacked and bombed Gaza several times.

Israel does not see things this way, since they gave over the territory to Palestinian administration in 2005, and have pulled back their troops over time . Meanwhile, Hamas, the Palestinian group which controls the territory, has launched rockets at Israel.

Hamas took over the Gaza Strip after the Fatah–Hamas conflict that was after the 2006 Palestinian elections Israel said Hamas to be a terrorist movement. Egypt did not agree with Hamas removing the Palestinian Authority officials from Gaza.

The Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip was said to be a safety measure by Israel, but the Free Gaza Movement are opposed. Hamas, along with other groups had been causing trouble there and in southern parts of Israel. The blocked started in 2007. Many countries (like Egypt) feel sorry for the Gaza Strip, a few others (like Iran) hate or some how fear Israel and some (like the USA) agree with Israel.

The Turkish passenger ship Cruse Liner MV Mavi Marmara was trying to take Turkish and Cypriot aid to the Gaza Strip on May the 31st, when the Israeli Navy found it. The 3 year old blockade was upheld by Flotilla 13. The Mavi Marmara was 40 miles from the Gaza Strip when it was raided. 27 British activists, 9 Palestinian, 8 Turks, 2 Irish, 1 Swedish, 1 South African, 1 American and 1 Albanian were on the Mavi Marmara, along with a few others. The Mavi Marmara was followed by the Irish passenger ship MV Rachel Corrie and 4 other minor vessels. The ships carried a total of 663-682 activists and aid workers, including several Turks, several Malaysians another American, an Australian, and a Belgian.
There were in total 663 or 683 people from 37 nations on board the 6 ships in the civilian flotilla. Notable people included Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Corrigan, former UN Assistant Secretary-General Denis Halliday, Israeli-Arab member of Knesset Haneen Zoubi, leader of the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel Raed Salah, Swedish novelist Henning Mankell, and a number of politicians from European and Arab national governments and the European Parliament.

Israel said that the other 5 ships were boarded and taken over peacefully, and that the only incidents took place in the "Mavi Marmara", but many reports that several people from the other ships were also wounded.

The flotilla had planned to break through the Gaza blockade, ignoring Israel's plan for the activists to stop at the port of Ashdod and transfer the cargo through there. After they ignored repeated calls to give in, soldiers from the Shayetet 13 (Flotilla 13) unit boarded the ships at around 04:00 IST

The convoy organizers Arafat Shoukriof, of the Free Gaza Movement (FGM), said the Israeli military story was not true. One of the co-organizers of the flotilla convoy, said those on board one ship had called them by telephone to say that Israeli helicopters had arrived to do a surprise raid.

The boarding of the "Mavi Marmara" resulted in violent clashes between activists and Israeli soldiers, though the details are disputed.

Apparently an Israeli helicopter dropped 30 specialist soldiers on to the ship. Fighting then broke out. An Israeli trooper was thrown over the side of the ship, some aid workers rioted and threw chairs at the Israelis. The Israelis then used tear gas, tasers, stun grenades and smoke bombs. Later several gun shots were fired by both sides. Finally, at the end of it all, an Albanian woman fell over the side of the ship. The soldiers, who used stun grenades, then asked for government permission to use their firearms, which they then received.

The Israeli military said that the troops were suddenly attacked after climbing down ropes from helicopters onto the deck of the ship. Soldiers were reportedly beaten badly, one was stabbed, and one was thrown in to the sea Two Israelis had their guns taken away. An Israeli commando said that there was live fire at some point against them from below deck. Stun grenades and tear gas were used in an attempt to disperse activists. When this did not work the commandos requested and received permission to use shoot the resisting activists. The commandos then shot activists in the legs, which forced them to disperse. The commandos reached the bridge and took over the ship after 30 minutes. Some fighting can be seen in videos released by the Israeli military and Free Gaza activists. The Israeli military released 20 videos of the incident,
According to Major Avital Leibovich of the IDF Spokesperson's Unit, the activists attacked the soldiers with knives, slingshots, spikes, and clubs, and with pistols that were found by the Israeli troops. Adam Shapiro, a board member of the Free Gaza Movement, said that according to the Al Jazeera correspondents on the ship, the soldiers opened fire immediately as they came down the ropes.

The wife of the Mavi Marmara captain, Nilüfer Ören, stated that IDF began tracking them after . There were 40 Israeli ships following and snooping on the convoy until the troopers were boarding the ships from helicopters at 04:45 am. She also said that stun grenades and smoke bombs were used. Therefore activists and crewmembers used gas masks. Norman Paech, a former member of the German parliament Left Party who was aboard the Mavi Marmara said he only saw three activists resisting on his part of the boat and said "They had no knives, no axes, only sticks that they used to defend themselves."

Reporters for Iranian TV and Al Jazeera TV news told of the use of tear gas/CS gas and stun grenades. The Israeli solders said that the activists wore gas masks and ski masks. Neither side were fully believed by the United Nations, who tried not to take sides.

The MV Rachel Corrie gave in and hoisted the white flag of truce when boarded by the Israeli navy.

The ship Challenger One sped up to allow journalists to take their photos of the ongoing raid. Huwaida Arraf, an American activist who was on the "Challenger One" reported that Israeli soldiers attacked any one who tried to block them from taking over the vessel with kicks, tasers, and stun grenades. Activist Huwaida Arraf reported that once on board the Challenger One, Israeli troops seized all communication equipment, cameras, mobile phones, radios and memory cards from activists.

Former UK diplomat Ed Peck, who was on board the ship Sfendoni, said that the Israelite troopers were well-trained, and behaved well. The soldiers scuffled with a few activists trying to block their access to the wheelhouse, but there were no major injuries, Peck said. Paul Larudee, a 64-year-old former language professor from El Cerrito, California on board the "Sfendoni", was beaten and tasered according to his family by the US Consul General and his lawyers; his family has reported that Israeli consular officials informed them that Larudee, a pacifist, was beaten after not following the orders of troops.

Crewman Shane Dillon reported that Israeli troops used stun guns, broke the nose of a Belgian woman among them, and beat another passenger. Australian photojournalist Kate Geraghty was attacked and tasered by Israeli troops aboard the "Challenger One", while attempting to photograph the raid.

Kutlu Tiryaki, a captain of the other vessel in the flotilla, said that the passengers did not have weapons at all, but only came to bring aid in a peaceful manner.

The final ship in the convoy gave in as it was raided and hoisted a white flag.

9-19 were said to be dead and 32-50 were said tobe injured. 10 of the injured were Israelis and 1 of the dead was a Turkish politician . Israel has confirmed four being dead. Among the dead was İbrahim Bilgen, a Turkish politician from the Felicity Party.

At least 32 activists who had been aboard the ships were arrested and incarcerated by the Israel Prisons Service, after they refused to sign deportation orders, including two who were wounded but refused hospital treatment.

Israel said that the navy forces "found weapons ready in advance and used against our forces." IDF photos displayed knives, metal and wooden poles, flares, wrenches and slingshots with marble projectiles said to have been used against the soldiers. The activists were said to have also lobbed stun grenades at IDF soldiers, and the IDF showed video illustrating this. The Israeli searches of the ship found bulletproof vests, night-vision goggles, and gas masks. A press-release by the Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel said that violence against the soldiers was already planned, and that "light weaponry" was found on the ships, including pistols that would have been seized from activists on the "Mavi Marmara" by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) soldiers.

A close-up picture presented to readers of "Jerusalem Post" as "The array of equipment found on board the ships that made up the Gaza aid flotilla was as divergent as the flotilla’s stated aims", showed some knives and clubs. Israeli troops also admitted to finding wheelchairs, cleaning supplies and baby milk onboard both the ships. A high ranking Norwegian officer stated after watching pictures that "This is not military equipment", and that most of the tools and kitchen knives would belong on a ship. High ranking Officials in the Customs Undersecretariat called the Israeli "complete nonsense".

For the most part, the diplomatic result was harsh on Israel.

Egypt opened its Rafah Border Crossing with the Gaza Strip to allow medical aid to enter after world criticism of the raid. Hamas's leader Khaled Meshaal call for the border to be opened.

The Israeli blockade against Gaza itself is not illegal, and it's okay for Israeli ships to operate in international waters to enforce it," said Allen Weiner, former U.S. State Department 

The German newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung", said international law says countries are not allowed to extend their rule on areas outside of their coastal waters. In Israel’s case, from the coast.

South Africa's Ambassador left Israel and returned to South Africa as a form of protest.

Turkey's deputy parliament speaker, Guldal Mumcu, said "[t]his attack was an open violation of United Nations rules and international law," and that "Turkey should seek justice against Israel through national and international legal authorities. The parliament expects the Turkish government to revise the political, military and economic relations with Israel, and to take effective measures." Lawyer Dr. Turgut Tarhanlı of the University of Istanbul cited the ideal of innocent passage, under which vessels are given safe travel rights in a manner which is not "prejudicial to the peace, good order or the security" of the state.

Cyprus stated its belief that NGOs must be allowed to do their work freely and lawfully. Further, it called for the lifting of the blockade of Gaza.

North Korea's Foreign Ministry condemned Israel, which "mercilessly killed or wounded dozens of civilians aboard the boats." It went on to call the attack "crime against humanity perpetrated at the U.S. connivance and under its patronage and a blatant challenge to the Arabs including Palestinians and the Mideast peace process". The statement also "expresses full support and solidarity with the cause of the Palestinians and other Arab people"

Iran Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei condemned the savage attack of the Zionist regime against an international aid convoy heading towards Gaza, and said the Israeli regime proved that it is more brutal than fascists. Iran president Mahmoud Ahmedinejad said that the incident was an "inhuman action of the Zionist regime against the Palestinian people" and that it would bring the regime "closer than ever to its end." The Iranian government called for a boycott of Israel. Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Secretary Saeed Jalili high lighted the need among regional and Islamic states to confront the Zionist regime of Israel effectively. Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the raid, saying "the incident once again revealed the criminal and war-mongering nature of the Zionist regime." Iran also on the UN Security Council and the OIC to take swift punitive action against Israel.

The Irish Taoiseach Brian Cowen described the attacks as "very serious" and stated that he feels the blockade action was a violation of international law. He also stated that people are allowed to receive humanitarian assistance.Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said he was "gravely concerned"

French President Nicolas Sarkozy condemned "the out sized use of force" against the flotilla.

Belgium's foreign minister, Steven Vanackere, called the use of Israeli force "disproportionate" and "invited the Israeli ambassador to explain how things happened."

The Bosnian representative at the UN Security Council, Ivan Barbalić, condemned the Israeli attack, called for an investigation and wanted Israel to lift the blockade of Gaza.

China Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu condemned Israel's raid on the international convoy and urged Israel to carry out UN Security Council resolutions and improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry demanded the quick release of two Bulgarian journalists travelling in the convoy. In addition, Bulgaria condemned the attack, saying "nothing can justify the violence that resulted in the killing of over 10 people on board one of the ships." It called for an investigation.

Protest rallies hit the streets of Tottenham, Paris, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Egypt and Malaysia.

The Czech Republic had gone out in support for Israel and declared that the Turkish flotilla was made to provoke Israel in to a military or political trap.

The USA also expressed pro-Israeli opinions, while Nauru said Hamas was wrong.

The Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the Israeli action, calling it a "criminal attack" and expressed its "most energetic condemnation." Cuba called for the lifting of the Gaza blockade and reaffirms its solidarity with the Palestinian people. The former Cuban President Fidel Castro had condemned Israel's attack on the Freedom Flotilla as "Nazi fascist fury." He added that the Israeli commandos who boarded the ships fired at the aid workers.

Montenegro, China, Zambia and the UK called for a peaceful solution to the situation.

The representative of Gabon at the UN Security Council expressed his shock at the events. He further called upon Israel to lift the blockade of Gaza, and called all parties to end the violence.

Switzerland called for an international inquiry and summoned the Israeli ambassador.

The Holy See expressed "great concern and pain" about the incident.

Israel planned to deport all of the captured passengers within 48 hours of their arrival into Israel. On of 2 June 2010 Israel had decided to release over 600 of the detained activists.

Goto

goto is a statement in many programming languages. It is a combination of the English words "go" and "to". It is a way to jump to another line of code.

Many languages support the goto statement, and many do not. In Java, goto is a reserved word, but cannot be used. (A "reserved word" is a word that is a "part" of the programming language and cannot be used for other things like naming variables.)

In Computer Science, there is a theory called the structured program theorem. This theory says that any program can be written in such a way that things are done with "functions" and "methods" (smaller sub-programs) instead of in one very big program and "goto" statements. The theory proves that the goto statement is not needed to write programs.

A goto statement is usually used with a "label". A label is a word that identifies a place in a piece of code. A goto statement in code usually looks like this:

In this example, the computer would jump to the location of "LABEL".

Many times the goto statement is, combined with the if statement. In this case, the computer will only jump to another place in the code if something is true. For example:

This can be read as "if "some condition is true", then go to the location of "LABEL"."

Different programming languages have different restrictions or limits on the use of goto statements. For example, the C programming language does not allow a goto to jump to a location inside of another function (subprogram).

The Rage: Carrie 2

The Rage: Carrie 2 is a 1999 American horror science fiction sequel movie. It follows classic 1976 horror movie "Carrie".

The director said that the movie shows how difficult it is to be a young woman today.

Rachael/Rachel, like Carrie, is a high school outcast who attends Bates High School, except that it is a new building because Carrie destroyed the first one. Also like Carrie, she has telekinetic powers, the ability to move things with your mind, powers. Throughout the movie, there is flashbacks to events that happened in the first movie.

Rachael's telekinetic powers are first shown when her Lisa commits suicide by jumping off of the roof of the school.

Oscar B. Cintas

Oscar Benjamin Cintas, (born Sagua la Grande, Cuba, 1887; died New York City, N.Y. 1957) was an important sugar and railroad magnate. He served as Cuba’s ambassador to the United States from 1932 until 1934.

Cintas used to be a Cuban Ambassador to the United States. Cintas liked to collect art and manuscripts. He had bought the Bliss Copy for $54,000 at a public auction in 1949. It "set a new high record for the sale of a document at public auction". The Castro government claimed Cintas' properties after it became powerful in 1959. Cintas had willed the Gettysburg Address to the American people if it would be kept at the White House. Cintas died in 1957. It was moved there in 1959 and is still there today.

Hyperopia

Hyperopia (also called hypermetropia or far-sightedness) is a problem with the focusing ability of the eye. People with hyperopia have an easier time seeing things that are far away than seeing things that are up close. Inside the eye is the lens which can change shape to change the focusing power of the eye and make things look clear. Someone who is not far-sighted only needs to use their lens to make far objects look clear. But for someone with hyperopia, their lens has to do that even when they're looking far away, and it has to work extra hard to make close objects look clear. 

Many people with small amounts of hyperopia don't have any problems seeing up close because it's easy for their lens to focus all the time, especially when they're children. But if they have more hyperopia, they often get headaches and eyestrain when they read for a long time because the muscle that controls the lens gets tired.

Hyperopia can be corrected with glasses, contact lenses, or surgery.

Dispersion

Dispersion is the idea that the frequency of a wave influences its velocity (speed). Dispersion is most easily seen in the refraction of light, when all the colors inside white light become separated by a prism. 

When a white beam is shone at the prism, all the colors in the light (color spectrum) are slowed when they meet the prism. Each color then refracts (bends) at a different angle, making us see a rainbow.

Dispersion is also important in telecommunication when different parts of a signal arrive at different times.

Absorption spectroscopy

Absorption spectroscopy is a technique used to find out what makes up a sample of a substance – in other words, a chemical analysis.

When a full spectrum of light (light with all the colours, like light from the sun) passes through the sample (which is often a gas) some specific colours do not show up on the other side. These colours of light are being absorbed by the sample. An image is created of the spectrum of light with black breaks where the light has been absorbed. These breaks are called absorption lines, and every element has its characteristic pattern of absorption lines.

On an atomic scale, this happens because of the electrons in the atoms of the sample - an electron can absorb light to gain energy. From experiments, electrons only ever absorb certain amounts of energy, suggesting an electron's energy must fit onto set, quantised, discrete "energy levels". The process of an electron going to a higher energy level is called "excitation". For any atom of a particular element, the energy needed to excite an electron from one specific energy level to another will be the same. This is important because it allows us to compare the absorption lines of say, the atmosphere of a far away planet, to the absorption lines of elements we know to exist in a lab. We can then reach a conclusion about what the distant planet's atmosphere may be made of.

The missing colours give us information about the energy of the photons that cause excitation. Note that the energy gained by the excited electron is equal to the energy of the incident photon (a particle of light), so only photons with fitting energies will cause an excitation. The energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency:" "

formula_1

Where "E" is the energy of a photon, "h" is Planck's constant (a constant is a set number that doesn't change) and "f" is the frequency of the photon. Since a colour can be described as a specific frequency of light, this is why the black breaks can be used to identify element(s) which the light is passing through.

The intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency, and this variation is the absorption spectrum.

In chemistry, the technique is used to detect and measure concentrations of a particular metal element within a solution. The scientists atomise the sample (make it turn to individual atoms) and then see what light wavelengths it absorbs. Each type of chemical (element) absorbs a particular wavelength, so scientists can tell which chemicals are in the sample. Every element has a different atomic absorption spectrum because of the different light wavelengths it absorbs.

Snowy River National Park

Snowy River National Park is a national park in Victoria (Australia), 323 km east of Melbourne. The park includes much of the Snowy River.

A lot of the park is a protected wilderness area, with no access for vehicles. The park in the Little River Gorge area, has one of the last natural habitats for the endangered Brush-tailed Rock Wallaby. Numbers for this species are estimated as extremely small, with the rugged terrain making it difficult to count the population. Over 250 species have been found in the park, 29 are rare or threatened in Victoria. These include the Long-footed Potoroo, Spotted Quoll (Tiger Quoll), Giant Burrowing Frog and Eastern She-oak Skink.

Little River Gorge is Victoria's deepest gorge. The Little River drops 610 metres from the Wulgulmerang plateau over a distance 14 km to where it joins the Snowy River at a height of 122 metres above sea level.

McKillops Road is the northern park boundary, with the Alpine National Park to the north of the road. The road is not suitable for caravans, trailers and large trucks because it is steep and winding. At McKillops Bridge the road which crosses the Snowy River near its junction with the Deddick River. A camping site near McKillops Bridge has excellent spots for swimming. It is also a good place to begin canoe and raft trips through the rugged gorges downstream. It is the start for the 18km Silver Mine Walking Track and the short Snowy River Trail.

Croissant

The croissant is a type of bread shaped like a crescent moon. It is usually eaten for breakfast in various countries. It can be called a crescent or a crescent roll. Although a crescent roll may be smaller. It is made of a variant of puff pastry. A croissant can be eaten with savory or sweet fillings thats what makes it good

Breads shaped like crescents have been around since the Medieval times. Before the croissant, there was a version of the croissant called a "feteer meshaltet". It came from Egypt. Many years later, a crescent-shaped version of feteer meshaltet was made. It was called "feteer halali" (crescent feteer). The feteer halali became popular throughout Europe, especially France. Later, feteer halali became known as a croissant. 

Croissants used to be only available to aristocrats. Marie Antoinette is believed to have introduced it to the French elites. Now they are available in any supermarkets.

Grizzly Rage

Grizzly Rage is a Syfy (used to be called The Sci-Fi Channel) television movie.

Four high school friends go to the woods to celebrate their graduation. When they break into a part of the woods that is closed, they hit and kill a grizzly cub with their car. Now the mother of the cub tries to attack and kill the four teenagers.

The movie is widescreen, has a Dolby Digital English 5.1 stereo track, and has no extras.

David Johnson, of DVD Verdict, said that there are better ways to spend your time instead of watching this movie. Paul Mavis, of DVD Talk, said that the movie fulfills none of the requirements of a bear attack exploitationer. A Bloody Disgusting review says that the movie is a pretty silly but satisfying flick.


Trapezius muscle

In human, trapezius muscle or trapezius is a large muscle that extends longitudinally on the upper portion of a human spine. Its functions are to move the scapulae and support the arm.

The trapezius has three functional regions: the superior region, which supports the weight of the arm; the intermediate region, which retracts the scapulae; and the inferior region, which rotates and depresses the scapulae.

The upper portion of the trapezius can be developed by elevating the shoulders. Middle fibers are developed by pulling shoulder blades together. The lower part can be developed by drawing the shoulder blades downward while keeping the arms almost straight and stiff.


William of Ockham

William of Ockham was a Franciscan friar who lived in the 14th century. He was born around 1285, in Ockham, Surrey, England, and died on 9 April 1347 in Munich. He was a scholastic philosopher and theologian. He is most famous for inventing Occam's razor. He wrote about logic, epistemology, natural philosophy, political philosophy, metaphysics and ethics. 

William of Ockham went to school at the University of Oxford, where he studied theology. After he graduated, he became a teacher of philosophy at the school. However, the Church did not like the ideas he was teaching, and brought him to court on charges of heresy in 1327. Because he was afraid he would be executed, William of Ockham fled the school and spent the rest of his life living with a group of friars who also did not like the large power that the Church had.

Palm cockatoo

The palm cockatoo (binomial name Probosciger aterrimus) (also known as the goliath cockatoo) is a black or dark-gray parrot of the cockatoo family. 

In the wild, it eats nuts and palm tree fruit by cracking them open with its strong and curved beak. In captivity, people feed palm cockatoos a variety of fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Palm cockatoos are native to Cape York Peninsula in northern Australia, the Aru Islands, Papua New Guinea, and other surrounding smaller islands. Palm cockatoo are common in these places, but scientists believe they are becoming less common because people are using their habitat for mining. They are intelligent and can be kept as pets.

Bellatrix Lestrange

Bellatrix Lestrange (née Bellatrix Black) is a fictional character of the "Harry Potter" series and is the sister of Narcissa Malfoy, the wife of Lucius Malfoy, and Draco Malfoy's aunt. Her parents are Cygnus Black III and Druella Black (née Rosier) and the eldest of three sisters: Bellatrix, Andromeda and Narcissa. She is an enthusiastic Death Eater who believes that Lord Voldemort is the supreme and everyone should follow him. She marries Rodolphus Lestrange, but it was Voldemort that she truly loved. In the Harry Potter movies she was played by Helena Bonham Carter. She has been to Azkaban, the wizard prison, but Lord Voldemort helped her and the other Death Eaters in Azkaban escape. She is killed by Molly Weasley at the end of book 7 when she attempts to kill Ginny Weasley with the killing curse Avada Kedavra. But her infamous legacy lived on through her illegitimate daughter, Delphini, who was born due to Bellatrix's relationship with Lord Voldemort.
Her name literally means "female warrior" in Latin, which is a nod to her aggressive behavior. Her surname Lestrange is a French variant of "strange", a perfect description of her strange personality and her maiden name Black is also a telltale about her dark life, as the color itself doesn't absorb light at all.

Long Wittenham

Long Wittenham is a village on the south bank of the River Thames in South Oxfordshire. In 1974 it came from Berkshire to the county of Oxfordshire.

There are crop marks (dating from the 6th Century) that there must have been a large collection of buildings, maybe a royal palace or at least high status Saxon enclosure. The number of objects that were found in Saxon burial sites around the village support this. These large, Saxon burial sites also indicate a good sized population, that lasted over many years.

The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book. By Tudor times, it had a population of around 200, with crops: wheat, oats, barley and even rye. Following a local legend Oliver Cromwell addressed the villagers on his way to his niece's wedding, in neighbouring Little Wittenham.

The village Cross has First Millennial origins: the base dating from the 7th century. St. Birinus preached here when he brought Christianity to the area. The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary, begun around 1120, is on the site of a previous Saxon church. Cruck Cottage can be architecturally dated to being around 800 years old and as such is (possibly) the oldest house in South Oxfordshire.

The building housing Pendon Museum, originally started life as The Three Poplars - a working man's pub. It was sold in 1954 and now houses a model railway museum.

Long Wittenham is in the Thames Valley north of Didcot, and southeast of Abingdon. To the west is the village of Appleford, which has the nearest railway station, on the line between Didcot and Oxford.

Snowy River

The Snowy River is a major river in south-eastern Australia. It starts on the slopes of Mount Kosciuszko, Australia's highest mountain. It gets its water from the eastern slopes of the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales, and then flows through the Snowy River National Park in Victoria and finally into Bass Strait. Up until the middle of the 20th century, the river was known for the large amount of fresh water it carried, its wide reach and large rapids. 

The river's course and surroundings have not changed very much, as it is protected by the Snowy River National Park. However, its flow of water was almost stopped in the 1950's by the building of the Snowy Mountains Scheme to make hydroelectricity. Four large dams were built, at Guthega, Island Bend, Eucumbene, and Jindabyne, as well as many smaller dams and tunnels. Less than 1% of the river flow, as measured at Jindabyne, New South Wales, continued to flow down the river. Concern over the health of river led to an agreement between the state and federal governments to increase the amount of water released back into the river. From 2002 to 2008 the flow was increased from 1% to 4%. The agreement planned to increase the flow to 15% by 2009 and 21% by 2012.

Peer support

Peer support is when a peer who has had the same experience helps another person by teaching them and listening to them. For a person with a disability, peer support is when a disabled person helps another person with the same kind of disability learn about independence and equal rights and how to take part in society. Peer support can help any kind of person who has any kind of problem. Some people can become peer mentors to help younger people. 

The Article 26 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires also peer support as rehabilitation.

Sulphur-crested cockatoo

Sulphur-crested cockatoos (binomial name Cacatua galerita) are large white parrots with yellow heads and tails. There are four subspecies of the bird. They live in Australian forests. Farmers do not like sulphur-crested cockatoos because the cockatoos eat vegetables that the farmers have grown. They are a protected species, but sometimes get shot.

Many people like sulphur-crested cockatoos and keep them as pets. They are very loud and have a natural desire to chew wood and other materials. They are very long-lived. In captivity they can live to 70 years. One cockatoo called Fred was still alive at 100 years of age in 2014. 

Salty liquorice

Salty liquorice, or Salmiak, is a salt candy that is eaten in Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands.

Hebrew people

The Hebrews (Hebrew: עברים or עבריים) is an ancient Semitic people of Middle East. They are ancestors of Israelites, son of Isaac and Arabs son of Ishmael and descend from Shem, son of Noah and cousin as the descendants of Japheth and the descendants of Ham. 

They escape from Ancient Egypt is recounted in Torah in book called Exodus in English, or "" שמות in Hebrew.



Roundheads

The Roundheads were a group of people who supported Parliament & Oliver Cromwell during the English Civil War. They were also called 'Parliamentarians'. They fought against Charles I and the Cavaliers otherwise known as 'Royalists'. The Parliamentary army put their soldiers in red coats. The British army continued using red in later centuries.

Some Puritans, but by no means all, wore their hair closely cropped round the head or flat and there was an obvious contrast between them and the men of fashion, who wore long ringlets. "Roundheads" appears to have been first used as a term of derision toward the end of 1641, when the debates in Parliament in the Clergy Act 1640 were causing riots at Westminster. According to John Rushworth the word was first used on 27 December 1641 by a disbanded officer named David Hide, who during a riot is reported to have drawn his sword and said he would "cut the throat of those round-headed dogs that bawled against bishops". A few decades later “Whigs” was the word for men of similar opinions.

Cavaliers

Cavaliers was a nickname for the people who fought for King Charles I of England during the English Civil War. They fought against the Roundheads and Parliament. At first the name applied only to the royalist cavalry; the words are similar because they were originally the same word.

Mall of America

Mall of America (also MOA, MoA, the Megamall) is a large shopping mall in the Twin Cities suburb of Bloomington, Minnesota, USA. The mall is southeast of the junction of Interstate 494 and Minnesota State Highway 77, north of the Minnesota River and is across the interstate from the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. In the United States, it is the second-largest inside mall in terms of retail space but is largest in terms of total enclosed floor area. Opened in 1992, the mall received 40 million visitors in 2006.

"Triple Five Group", owned by the Ghermezian family of Canada, fully owns and manages the property, and has also owned West Edmonton Mall in Canada.

In addition to the inside of the mall, outside of the mall are additional hotels, kiosks, restaurants, and stores. The Mall of America and the additional businesses meet at the South Loop District in Bloomington.

Mall of America (founded by John Scott & Benjamin Clark) has a gross area of 4.2 million square feet (390,000 m²), with 2.5 million sq ft. (230,000 m²) available as retail space. The mall is a nearly symmetric building, with a roughly rectangular floor plan. Over 520 stores are arranged along three levels of pedestrian walkways on the sides of the rectangle, with a fourth level on the East side. An addition planned north of the mall will allow for up to 900 stores. Four "anchor" department stores are at the corners. The Mall is organized into four different zones, each with its own decorative style.

Despite Minnesota's often cold temperatures in the winter, only the mall's entrances are heated. Heat is allowed in through skylights above Nickelodeon Universe. Heat is produced by lighting fixtures, other electric devices and also by employees and guests of the mall in sufficient amounts to keep it comfortable. In fact, even during the winter, air conditioning systems need to be run nonstop during peak hours to ensure a comfortable shopping environment.

Although the common areas are unheated, the individual stores do have heating systems.

Two nearly identical seven story parking ramps on east and west sides provide 12,550 parking spaces. Parking lots on the north and south of the building, along with nearby overflow parking, bring the total number of spaces up to approximately 20,000.

The mall was designed and built by "Triple Five Group", owned by the Ghermezian brothers of Canada, who also own the biggest shopping mall in North America, the West Edmonton Mall. Mall of America is on the past site of Metropolitan Stadium, where the Minnesota Vikings and Minnesota Twins played until the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome opened. The teams left Metropolitan Stadium in 1982. A plaque in the amusement park is where home plate used to be in that stadium. One seat from Met Stadium was placed in Mall of America at its exact location (including elevation) in the stadium, to recognize a 520 foot home run hit by hall-of-famer Harmon Killebrew on June 3, 1967.

In 1986, The Bloomington Port Authority signed an agreement with the Ghermezian Organization. Groundbreaking for the mall took place on June 14, 1989. Organizations involved include Melvin Simon and Associates, Teachers Insurance and Annuity (a.k.a. TIAA), the Triple Five Group, and the office of architect Jon Jerde.

The mall opened its doors to the public August 11, 1992. Even before opening, Mall of America had earned several nicknames, including "The Megamall" (or "The Megamess" during construction), "Sprawl of America", "Hugedale" (in reference to the four major "Dale" shopping malls within the Twin Cities, Rosedale, Southdale, Ridgedale and Brookdale) and, simply, "The Mall".

It became the second largest shopping mall in total area and largest in total store vendors in the United States when it opened, however, the mall has never been the largest in the world (the West Edmonton Mall, opened in 1991, is larger). Mall of America is the most visited shopping mall in the world with more than 40 million visitors annually (or roughly eight times the population of the state of Minnesota). The mall employs over 12,000 workers.

Starting on September 4, 1995, The Mall had an event for live television for the first time. Time-Warner owned professional wrestling company World Championship Wrestling set up in the building for the Inaugural edition of WCW Monday Nitro - also the WCW debut of Lex Luger, under his "The Narcissist" gimmick. This first broadcast on Turner Network Television, along with later editions broadcast from the Mall, would become a well known part of the federation's competition with The World Wrestling Federation.

During its run as a large entertainment and retail venue, certain aspects-such as-have been criticized and closely looked at. A Mardi Gras themed bar, Fat Tuesdays, shut its doors in early 2000 due to indecent exposure and alcohol related offenses, for ignoring warnings from the mall and Bloomington police to not repeat incidents caught on tape the year before. Following that incident were other problems, such as foot traffic within the Mall after the bars (all on the fourth floor) had closed for the evening. The Mall storefronts were closed, however. The Hooters restaurant, the Cantina #1 restaurant and the Theatres at Mall of America movie theater are the only establishments remaining on the fourth floor.

In 2003, after a six year legal battle between Simon Property Group, the managing general partner of the property, and the Ghermezian brothers/Triple Five Group, over majority ownership of the site, a federal appeals judge ruled in favor of the Ghermezians, effectively transferring control and planning authority of the mall back to its original founders. The dispute stemmed from a 1999 purchase of Teacher's Insurance's 27.5% equity stake by Simon Properties, giving them majority ownership. The Ghermezians claimed they were never told of the deal and sued Simon, citing fiduciary responsibility.

On November 3, 2006, the Ghermezians gained full control of Mall of America, spending US$1 billion to do so. The ruling cleared the way for Triple Five to begin work on what is being called "Phase II".

On December 24, 2022, A person opened fire killing one person in the mall.

Phase II is the planned expansion for MOA, developing a large, empty area of land north of the mall which was the former home of the Met Center indoor arena and integrating an IKEA store built on a portion of the property in 2004. Phase II, in current form, includes a dinner theatre, ice rink, three hotels, and a waterpark; similar in design to the West Edmonton Mall. The expansion will not make MOA exceed the size of the WEM (itself going under expansion).

MOA currently estimates costs of $1.9 billion for the expansion, doubling the mall's size with a 5.2 million-square-foot extension. The mall's developers have asked for $234 million in state and local subsidies, but the request was vetoed as part of a larger bill by Gov. Tim Pawlenty on its first appearance in the 2006-07 session.

In the meantime, MOA has signed papers to bring in Great Wolf Resorts as the waterpark operator, as well as Bass Pro Shops and a Kimpton Hotel. The expansion section will connect to the mall on all four levels, and an adjacent IKEA store via a second level bridge. There will be an NHL-sized ice rink for public & private skating. There will also be an additional parking ramp, adding 8,000 parking spaces.

There will also be fine art exhibits planned in the expansion, and two upscale department stores. Another plan that was in the works would have been fashions, architecture, and restaurants based after Europe.

On May 18, 2008, the Minnesota State Legislature passed a bill granting the city of Bloomington the right to raise property and sales taxes to pay for the MOA expansion.

Nickelodeon Universe is an indoor theme park in the center of the mall, formerly known as Knott's Camp Snoopy, Camp Snoopy, and The Park at MOA. The park features roller coasters, among numerous other rides and attractions, and is the largest indoor theme park in the United States. Unlike many indoor amusement parks, Nickelodeon Universe has a great deal of natural foliage in and about the park, and its floor has a wide variance in height - the highest ground level in the park is 15 feet above the lowest. This allows for a far more naturalistic experience than would normally occur in an indoor amusement park.

The park features two new roller coasters; SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge and Avatar Airbender. It also has a miniature golfing section called Moose Mountain. With 18 holes, it is designed to create a challenge for players hoping to seek a hole in one.

Guests travel through a 300 foot long curved tunnel through 14 feet of water to view over 4,500 sea creatures including sharks, turtles, stingrays, and many more. Underwater Adventures offers special events such as sleepovers, scuba diving, snorkeling, and birthday parties.



Twin Cities public events:




The mall is used as a major transportation hub in the region, with bus and light rail service linking the mall to other destinations. Regular public transit service is provided by Metro Transit and other area bus lines, and nearby Mystic Lake Casino offers free shuttles to their establishment. The primary bus/rail station for scheduled local service is in the lower level of the eastern parking ramp. There, the Hiawatha Line light rail line connects the mall to the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport and from there to downtown Minneapolis (another major shopping destination in the region, particularly during weekdays). The mall is being discouraged as a park and ride facility, and overnight parking is banned to prevent passengers taking the train to the airport. Commuters are encouraged to use the nearby 28th Avenue Station's parking lot. The mall is the first stop on the Cedar Avenue Bus Rapid Transitway and the nineteenth, final stop on the Hiawatha Line.

Union (American Civil War)

During the American Civil War, the Union meant the federal government of the United States, which was supported by the twenty free states and five border states. It was opposed by 11 Southern slave states. The Union states included the Western states of California, Oregon, and (after 1864) Nevada. They also included states then called the "Old Northwest" and now usually thought to be part of the Midwest. However, the Union has been also often called "the North", both then and now. The Union states were mostly richer and more industrialized.

Painful sexual act

Painful sexual act is a medical problem where a person feels pain in their genitals before, during, or after a sexual act. Doctors call this problem dyspareunia. It can have physical or emotional causes. Both men and women can have dyspareunia. Up to one-fifth of women (one in every five) may have dyspareunia at some point in their lives.

When a woman experiences a painful sexual act, the pain may distract her from feeling pleasure and excitement. Her vagina will be less wet and will not expand as much as usual. When the vagina is dry and undilated, thrusting of the penis is painful. Even after the original cause of her pain has disappeared, a woman may feel pain simply because she expects pain.

In most cases, painful sexual acts have a physical cause at first. There are many physical problems that can cause or worsen painful sexual act. A doctor may be able to identify the cause by doing a careful physical examination and medical history. Some of the most common physical causes are infections of the vagina, urinary tract, cervix, or fallopian tubes; endometriosis; scar tissue left by surgery (like an episiotomy); and ovarian cysts and tumors. Common infections are mycoses (infections caused by a fungus), candidiasis, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, urinary tract infections, coliform bacteria, monilial organisms and herpes). Painful sexual acts can also be caused by problems with a woman's anatomy, like hymenal remnants (pieces of the hymen that stay in the vagina) or female genital mutilation, or when the entrance to the vagina has become too small for normal penetration (Sarrell and Sarrell 1989).

In women who are past menopause, a common cause of painful sexual act is having too little estrogen. In women who are breastfeeding, a common cause is dryness of the vagina. Women who are getting radiation therapy for cancer in the pelvic area may have pain during sex because the walls of the vagina have atrophied (wasted away) and are more sensitive to injury. Dryness in the vagina can also be a cause of painful sexual act for women with Sjögren's syndrome, which attacks the glands that create saliva and tears.

Painful sexual acts may be one of the first symptoms of cystitis (a bladder infection). People with cystitis may have bladder pain during or after sex. Women with cystitis usually have pain the day after sex, because the muscles around her bladder are spasming (tightening up painfully). Women with cystitis usually also have urinary frequency (needing to urinate a lot) and/or urinary urgency (needing to urinate suddenly).

Pain is sometimes experienced in the testicular or glans area of the penis immediately after ejaculation. Infections of the prostate, bladder, or seminal vesicles can lead to burning or itching sensations following ejaculation. Men suffering from cystitis may experience intense pain at the moment of ejaculation, focused at the tip of the penis. Gonorrheal infections are associated with burning or sharp penis pains during ejaculation. Urethritis or prostatitis can make genital stimulation painful or uncomfortable. Anatomic deformities of the penis (retraction of a too-tight foreskin) may also result in pain during sexual act. 
In men pain in the genital organs during ejaculation or immediately after is experienced as sharp, stabbing, and/or burning, it may be persistent and returning. The duration of pain is usually brief. The immediate cause of psychogenic post ejaculatory pain is the involuntary painful spasm or cramping of certain pain-sensitive muscles in the male genital and reproductive organs. The painful muscle cramps may be attributable to a man’s conflict about ejaculating.

A pelvic floor disorder can also be the cause of pain during and after sex.

Sufferers will see several doctors before a correct diagnosis is made. Women are also often hesitant to seek treatment for chronic vulvar pain, especially since many women begin experiencing symptoms around the time they become sexually active. Before being successfully diagnosed patients sometimes are told that the pain is "in their head". For the diagnosis doctor carefully takes a history and carefully examines the pelvis to duplicate the discomfort and to identify a site or source of the pelvic pain. The diagnosis of painful sexual act has to be differentiated from conditions known as ‘’’chronic vulvar pain’’’ and vaginismus. The pain may be acquired or lifelong. It may be generalized (complete) or situational. During the first two weeks, painful sexual acts caused by penis insertion or movement of the penis in the vagina or by deep penetration is often due to disease or injury deep within the pelvis. Inquiry should determine whether the pain is superficial or deep - whether it occurs primarily at the vaginal outlet or vaginal barrel or upon deep thrusting against the cervix. The possible role of psychological factors in either causing or maintaining the pain must be considered.

Atrophy of vagina as a source of painful sexual act is most frequently seen in women after menopause and is generally associated with estrogen deficiency. That is associated with inadequacy of lubrication of vagina, which can lead to painful friction during sexual act.




Neem

Neem is a tree in the mahogany family Meliaceae. It is native to India, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Pakistan. It grows in tropical and semi-tropical regions. It was also the state tree of Hyderabad Deccan.

Neem is a fast-growing tree in India that can reach up to 15–20 m (about 50–65 feet) tall, and sometimes even to 35–40 m (115–131 feet). It is evergreen. It is found in some major parts of Tamil nadu like tuticorin,tirunelveli ,etc.

Products made from neem have been used in India for over two millennia for their medicinal properties. They are said to be antifungal, antidiabetic, antibacterial, antiviral, contraceptive and sedative. Neem products are also used in selectively controlling pests in plants. Neem is considered a part of Ayurvedic medicine.

Neem is also known as the' village pharmacy'. All parts of neem are used for preparing many different medicines, especially for skin disease.

Nigel de Jong

Nigel de Jong (; born 30 November 1984) is a Dutch former professional footballer. He is a midfielder for Italian Serie A club Milan and the Netherlands national team. He joined the Ajax youth academy when he was young and made the first team at age 17.

De Jong moved from Ajax in 2006 to join Hamburg. He then moved to Manchester City in January 2009 for around £18 million. He became an important part of Manchester City's midfield. He has earned a reputation of being combative and feisty player. This got him nicknames like ""The Terrier"" and ""Lawnmower"". He moved to Italian club Milan in August 2012.

On 19 October 2002, de Jong played for the Ajax first team for the first time. He scored his first goal on 18 February 2003 in a 1–1 draw against Arsenal in the UEFA Champions League. He started playing in the first team often in the next season. In this season, Ajax won the Eredivisie. In 2004–05, de Jong was named Ajax Player of the Season. Later, after starting in midfield for quite a while, he found himself sitting on the bench more often than being one of the players at the start of a match. On 7 December 2005, it was announced that de Jong did not want to stay with Ajax. His contract with Ajax was due to finish in July 2006.

On 26 January 2006, de Jong signed a four and a half year contract at German Bundesliga club Hamburg. He moved there for about €1 million. He played for Hamburg for the first time two days later. In the match, Hamburg lost 2–1 to Nuremberg. In March 2006, de Jong scored the winning goal in Bayern Munich's first ever loss at the Allianz Arena. The week after, he got his first red card in a UEFA Cup match against Rapid Bucharest. He had to stop playing in April because he needed surgery on a knee problem. The injury also meant that he could not play for the Netherlands at the 2006 World Cup. However, after becoming fit again, he was put on standby.

On 21 January 2009, de Jong moved to Manchester City for around £18 million. He signed a four-and-a-half year contract. He played for the first time against Newcastle United on 28 January 2009. He appeared sixteen times in the Premier League.

De Jong was in the starting team against Arsenal on 12 September 2009. He was given Man of the Match by Sky Sports after Manchester City won 2-1 over Chelsea on 5 December 2009. By the end of the season, the fans liked him. He was one of Roberto Mancini's first picks as defensive midfielder as the team just missed out on the Champions League. De Jong scored his first goal for Manchester City when they won 2-1 against West Ham United on 1 May 2011.

On 31 August 2012, de Jong joined Italian Serie A club Milan. He signed a three-year contract.

On 31 March 2004, de Jong played his first game with the Netherlands in a friendly against France. He was not picked to play in UEFA Euro 2004. He missed the 2006 FIFA World Cup because his knee was injured.

He scored his first goal for the Netherlands against Iceland on 6 June 2009 in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match. This match made the Netherlands go through to the 2010 World Cup.

De Jong was part of the Dutch team for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He was one of the starting players for their first match in the competition. In this match, they won 2–0 against Denmark. He was not allowed to play in the semi final against Uruguay because he got his second yellow card in a match against Brazil. He played in the Final, where the Netherlands lost 1–0 to Spain.

Nematomorpha

The Nematomorpha (horsehair worms) are a phylum of parasitic cycloneuralian animals. They look similar to nematode worms and live in similar environments, which is why their names are similar. They are sometimes called Gordiacea.

They range in size from long and in extreme cases may be up to 2 meters long. They are in diameter. Horsehair worms can be discovered in damp areas such as watering troughs, streams, puddles, and cisterns. 

About 326 species are known and an estimate suggests that there may be about 2000 species worldwide. 

Fossilized worms have been reported from Lower Cretaceous Burmese amber 100–110 million years ago.

The adult worms are free living and, in North America, are usually found only in the summer months in or near shallow water.

The larvae are parasitic on arthropods: beetles, cockroaches, grasshoppers and crickets. These are their final hosts, but since they do not live in water, the nematomorph life cycle has an extra stage. 

A day or two after they come out of their hosts, the adult worms mate in the water, and then around mid-August or Mid-October, they lay their eggs in the water. It takes about a month for the larvae to develop inside the egg. Once the larvae hatch, they somehow get into gastropods (like snails and slugs), insects, or earthworms, which live in moist habitats. There they build a cyst, and grow. The animal they grow inside is called an interim (temporary) host, because a final host is still needed.

Next, developing nematomorph worms can be found in their final hosts (beetles, etc.). It is not clear how they get there, but probably the final host eats the interim host with the larvae inside them. After they appear in the final host, the nematomorphs begin to eat it from the inside.

The nematomorph may control the host, leading it towards water and even causing it to jump into the water. Then it breaks out of the beetle in or near the water and finds a knot of other worms. There it can mate.

Burgess Shale

The Burgess Shale Formation in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia is one of the world's most celebrated fossil sites, the best of its kind. It is famous for the exceptional preservation of the soft parts of its fossils. It is ~505 million years old (Middle Cambrian), one of the earliest soft-parts fossil beds.

The rock unit is a black shale, and crops out at a number of localities near the town of Field in the Yoho National Park.

The Burgess Shale was discovered by palaeontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott in 1909, towards the end of the season's fieldwork. He returned in 1910 with his sons, and established a quarry on the flanks of Fossil Ridge. The fact that fossils were of soft-bodied forms, and the range of organisms new to science, led him to return to the quarry almost every year until 1924. At this point, aged 74, he had got over 65,000 specimens.

Describing the fossils is a vast task, pursued by Walcott until his death in 1927, and continued into the 21st century. Walcott, led by scientific opinion at the time, attempted to categorise all fossils into living taxa. As a result, the fossils were regarded as little more than curiosities at the time. It was not until 1962 that a first-hand reinvestigation of the fossils was attempted, by Alberto Simonetta. This led scientists to recognise that Walcott had barely scratched the surface of information available in the Burgess Shale.

A second quarry (in the same geological formation) was opened. A thorough reassessment of the Burgess Shale showed that the fauna were much more varied and unusual than Walcott had realised. The Royal Ontario Museum now has the largest collection of Burgess Shale material in the world with over 150,000 specimens. Many of the animals present had bizarre anatomical features and only the slightest resemblance to other known animals. Examples include "Opabinia", with five eyes and a snout like a vacuum cleaner hose; "Nectocaris", and "Hallucigenia". This last was originally reconstructed upside down, walking on its spines.

The Burgess Shale was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. It became part of the Canada Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site in 1984.


Solnhofen Limestone

The Solnhofen limestone is the world's most famous fossil site. It is a lagerstätte of Upper Jurassic limestone which has preserved many fossils in great detail. The specimens of "Archaeopteryx" are perhaps the world's most valuable fossils, because they are the earliest fossils of a bird capable of flight.

The Solnhofen beds lie in the German state of Bavaria (Bayern), halfway between Nuremberg (Nürnberg) and Munich (München). They were originally quarried as a source of roof and floor tiles, then for lithographic printing.

In the late Jurassic this area was an archipelago at the edge of the Tethys Sea. This included placid lagoons which had limited access to the open sea because they were surrounded by coral reefs. Water runoff from the land was low and, under the sun, evaporation was high. Salinity rose so high that the resulting brine could not support life, except at the top of the water column.

The lowest water was not only very salty, but hypoxic: very low in oxygen. This was caused by the lack of water mixing. Many ordinary scavengers were absent from the lagoon floor. From the condition of the water, it follows that almost all of the fossilised animals were not living in the lagoon. They must have lived on land, in the air, or out to sea beyond the reef. Then when they died, they fell, drifted, or were washed into the lagoons from the air, ocean or land. Occasional storms at sea would have killed flying animals, and swept fish over the reef in a suspension of finely-dispersed lime. There the bodies sank into the dead zone and were preserved.

Once in the lagoon, bodies became buried in soft carbonate mud. Thus, many delicate creatures avoided consumption by scavengers or being torn apart by currents. The wings of dragonflies, the imprints of stray feathers, and terrestrial plants that washed into the lagoons were all preserved. 

"The variety and number of fossils known is deceptive. The occurrence of fossils is quite low. Indeed, a worker can quarry for an entire day and find not a single one. The hundreds of years of quarrying are what make them seem so apparently common". 

The range of fossil species gives a comprehensive picture of a local Jurassic ecosystem. At times, the lagoons almost dried out, exposing sticky carbonate muds that trapped insects and even a few small dinosaurs. Over 600 species have been identified. Seven genera and up to 29 species of pterosaur have been found. This suggests that in this ecosystem pterosaurs were more common and diversified than birds. The pterosaur sizes ranged from that of a sparrow to 1.2 m (4 ft) in length.

The fine-grained texture of the mud silt forming the limestone is ideal for making lithographic plates for printing illustrations. Extensive quarrying in the 19th century revealed many fossil finds, as commemorated in the name "Archaeopteryx lithographica", all the specimens of which come from these deposits. The closest modern analogue to the Solnhofen conditions is said to be Orca Basin in the northern Gulf of Mexico, though that area is much deeper than the Solnhofen lagoons.

The Solnhofen biota is composed of the animals and plants which lived in the area. All were found in the limestone quarries.

The carbonate was produced mainly by: 
Both these groups produce calcium carbonate skeletal structures.

Some of remains of the land plants got down into the lagoon. They were almost all gynmosperms.









The data show some things about the biota of the region.


Aenictogiton

Aenictogiton is a genus of ants. The genus has seven species. The genus is given its own subfamily, Aenictogitoninae. All of the species are known only from males from middle Africa and show a phylogenetic liking to the army ants (and are in the dorylomorph subfamilies). Nothing is known about the workers, queens and behavior of these ants. A few not described species are known to exist in a few collections in the world.


Ketosis

Ketosis is when there are greater levels of ketone bodies in the blood or urine. It comes when ketone bodies are released into the bloodstream due to low glycogen levels in the liver. Ketone bodies are made by a process called ketogenesis. Ketosis can be understood as the use of body fat as a source of energy. Ketosis has 3 main sources of energy, also known as ketone bodies: acetoacetate, acetone, and beta-hydroxybutyrate.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that is most common in children. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a cancer that begins in muscle tissue - usually the muscles that are attached to bones to help a person move.

Rhabdomyosarcoma should not be confused with rhabdomyolysis, which is often called "rhabdo" for short.

There are three different kinds of rhabdomyosarcoma.

This is the most common type of rhabdomyosarcoma. More than half of people with this cancer have ERMS. It is most common in children under age 6.

Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma usually happens in: 

This is the second most common type of rhabdomyosarcoma. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is more common in older children and teenagers, but it can also happen in younger children and adults.

ARMS usually happens in the big muscles in:

However, it can also happen in the genitals or the area around the anus.

This type of rhabdomyosarcoma usually grows faster than embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and needs more treatment than ERMS.

Anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma does not happen very often. When it does happen, it usually affects adults; is very rare in children.

This type of cancer usually grows quickly and needs a lot of treatment.

The choice of how to treat rhabdomyosarcoma depends on many things. For example:

Based on all of these things, the patient and their medical team can decide what treatment is best. There are three types of treatments for rhabdomyosarcoma:

The prognosis of a person with rhabdomyosarcoma also depends on many different things. For example, adults with rhabdomyosarcoma usually have tumors that grow faster and are harder to treat. Prognosis also depends on the type of rhabdomyosarcoma a person has, what kind of treatment they get, whether their cancer has spread, and many other things.

Underweight

The term underweight refers to humans that have much less weight than they should. Being underweight is bad for the overall health of the person affected. It is normal that a person's weights changes over time. Being underweight is often defined using a measure called the body mass index which calculates a score, based on height and weight. If this score is below 18.5, a person is generally said to be underweight. This is only a general indication, though as the scores must not be calculated for everyone. It does not apply to children and adolescents, for example.

Being underweight can have different causes:

There are problems that are related to being underweight. Very often being underweight is not the first problem. Rather, it often is the effect of another condition or disease. Unexpected weight loss requires the attention of a doctor. There might be another disease. If that disease is treated, the weight problem also disappears.

Another problem underweight people face is that the weight problem affects their health: Their immune system is weakened, and they may get sick more often. People who are underweight because they cannot get or afford the right food need special attention. Women who are underweight may not have their menstruation and face difficult pregnancies.

Once they were being underweight, psychically, they may feel sad and worried about their health. Therefore, family and friends should support them to help them get rid of their unhappiness. 

Etihad Airways

Etihad Airways is one of two major airlines in the United Arab Emirates. It was created by royal decree in July 2003. It started carrying passengers in November 2003.

Petrol Ofisi

Petrol Ofisi is Turkish petroleum company. It was created in 1941 by Turkey to make gasoline and oil available to the country of Turkey. The government sold the company in July 2000. More than 95% of the company is now owned by Doğan Holding and OMV. The remaining shares of the company are publicly traded stock.

Pot-in-pot refrigerator

The pot-in-pot refrigerator, also known as a Zeer in Arabic, is a food cooling device. It works by using the evaporation of water. It needs no electricity.

It is made by putting a clay pot inside a larger clay pot with wet sand in between the pots and a wet cloth on top. As the water evaporates it cools the inside, letting food stored in the inner pot to be kept fresh for some time. It must be placed in a dry, ventilated place for the water to evaporate to the outside.

Evaporative coolers perform poorly or not at all in climates with high humidity.

Mohammed Bah Abba of Nigeria patented the device in 1995 and was awarded a Rolex prize in 2000 for developing the “pot-in-pot preservation/cooling system”. However, the device was known at least as early as the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, as seen by the hieroglyphic kbb, "to cool".

Earthenware wine coolers work on the same principle. They are soaked in cold water for a while, then emptied and put on the table. The pores of the earthenware are now full of water. Evaporation from the earthenware keeps white wine cool enough for several hours.


Ankylosauridae

Ankylosauridae is a family of any armoured dinosaur which evolved 125 million years ago and became extinct 65 million years ago during the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event. Ankylosauridae and their sister group, the Nodosauridae make up the infraorder Ankylosauria. 

They have been found in western North America, Europe and East Asia. Good specimens are rare; most are known only from fragments, and bits of their armour.

"Scelidosaurus", whose remains had been found in England, was described by Richard Owen in 1861. Its exact position in the group is still not yet agreed. It was a largely quadrupedal armoured animal from the Lower Jurassic, feeding on low scrubby plants. This is pretty much a description of many dinosaurs in this group.

Jehol Biota

The Jehol biota includes all the living organisms – the ecosystem – of northeastern China between 133 to 120 million years ago (mya). This is the Lower Cretaceous ecosystem which left fossils in the Yixian Formation, some 125–121 mya, and the Jiufotang Formation. It is also believed to have left fossils in the Sinuiju series of North Korea. 

The ecosystem in the Lower Cretaceous was dominated by wetlands and numerous lakes (not rivers, deltas, or marine habitats). Rainfall was seasonal, alternating between semi-arid, and mesic conditions. The climate was temperate. The Jehol ecosystem was interrupted at times by ash eruptions from volcanoes to the west. The word "Jehol" was the name given during the Japanese occupation of North-East China, 1933–1946.

The Jehol biota is noteworthy for the many different fossils and the large numbers of individuals of each species that have been recovered.

The biota includes many species that were previously known only from the Upper Jurassic or earlier. These include the dinosaur "Sinosauropteryx", and the pterosaur "Dendrorhynchoides". There was even a primitive protomammal – a tritylodont therapsid – from Lower Cretaceous Japan. Tritylodonts were previously thought to have gone extinct in the Middle Jurassic. The biota also has the earliest and most basal (primitive) known members of groups which spread all around the world by the Upper Cretaceous, including neoceratopsians, therizinosaurs, tyrannosaurs, and oviraptors.

The Jehol biota has produced fossils of plant mega- and microfossils, including the earliest angiosperms, charophytes and dinocysts, snails (gastropods), clams (bivalves), superabundant aquatic arthropods called conchostracans, ostracods, shrimps, insects, spiders, fish, frogs and salamanders, turtles, choristoderes, lizards (squamata), pterosaurs, and dinosaurs including dinobirds, the largest mammals known from the Mesozoic, and a great diversity of birds including the earliest advanced birds, and the smallest and largest birds known from the Mesozoic.

The forests around the lakes were dominated by conifers including members of the podocarp pine, araucaria, and cypress families. There were also ginkgos, bennettitaleans, ephedra, horsetails, ferns, and mosses. The leaves and needles of the trees show adaptations to a dry season, but some of the ferns and mosses are types that grow in very wet habitats. It is possible that the latter avoided dry conditions by growing very close to bodies of water. "Archaefructus" has been described as the earliest known flowering plant (Angiosperm), and it is reconstructed as a water plant.

The fossils have been found in several sites of exceptional preservation. The two most famous are the Yixian and Jiufotang Formations. The Yixian and Jiufotang Formations are "Lagerstatten", meaning that they have exceptionally good conditions for fossil preservation. The fossils are numerous, but also very well preserved. They often have articulated skeletons (bones connected), soft tissues, colour patterns, stomach contents, and twigs with leaves and flowers still attached. 

Palaeontologists deduced two things from this. The first is that the land animals and plants were washed into the lakes very gently, or were already in the lakes when they died. They do not show the damage seen in fossils formed by large floods. Second, volcanic ash is commonly interbedded with lake sediments, and ashfalls seem to have quickly buried the fossilized organisms, created anoxic conditions around them, and prevented scavenging.

The biota probably extended as far as North Korea. Its earliest appearance may be in another Chinese lagerstätte, the Huajiying Formation.

A geological formation in Liaoning, N.E. China. It has outstanding preservation. The deposits of siliclastic (SiO) sediment alternate with basalt. It was first recognised by the Japanese when they occupied Manchuria ('Jehol'). The formation was laid down 125–121 million years ago. It contains the famous "Confuciusornis" beds.

"Sinodelphys", the earliest metatherian mammal, was found in this formation.

The Jiufotang Formation is a Lower Cretaceous geological formation in Liaoning. It has yielded fossils of feathered dinosaurs, primitive birds, pterosaurs, and other organisms. 

The exact age of the Jiufotang has been debated for years, with estimates ranging from the Upper Jurassic to the Lower Cretaceous. Argon radiometry confirmed a Lower Cretaceous age for the site, 120.3 +/-0.7 million years ago. Fossils of "Microraptor" and "Jeholornis" are from the Jiufotang.

Lower Cretaceous, but exact dates uncertain. This is probably the earliest of the Jehol biota lagerstätte sites. Contains sedimentary members interspersed with volcanic ash. Contains birds, dinosaurs and fish.

New York City draft riots

The New York Draft Riots (July 13 – 16, 1863; known at the time as Draft Week) were violent disturbances in New York City. They happened when anger with President Lincoln and his laws was highest. At first it just wanted to show anger at the draft. But the protests became violent and "a virtual racial pogrom, with uncounted numbers of blacks murdered on the streets". Major General John E. Wool said on July 16, "Martial law ought (should) to be proclaimed, but I have not a sufficient (enough) force to enforce it." The military stopped the mob using weapons. However, they had already destroyed many buildings, including homes and an orphanage for black children.

FC Erzgebirge Aue

The Fußballclub Erzgebirge Aue is a football club which plays in the German 2. Bundesliga. The club is from Aue in Saxony.

The club was founded as SG Aue in 1945 and on 1 November 1948 became BSG Pneumatik Aue. Changes in sponsorship led to a change in name to Zentra Wismut Aue in 1949 and then simply to SC Wismut Aue in 1951. 1951 they promoted to the DDR-Oberliga. In 1954 the government decided that the nearby city Chemnitz(now called Karl-Marx-Stadt) should have a good team. So the name of Aue was changed to SC Wismut Karl Marx Stadt. But the club still played in Aue. In 1963 Karl Marx Stadt got its own team so the club was renamed to SC Wismut Aue.

Till 1989 Aue was one of the most successful teams in the DDR. They were 3 times winner of the DDR Oberliga (1956, 1957, 1959) and won the Cup once(1955). In the united Germany the started in the NOFV-Oberliga Süd (4th stage). With the establishment of the Regionalliga Nordost (3rd stage) in 1994, the club qualified for the new league. 200o they came to the Regionalliga Nord and were promoted to the 2. Bundesliga after the 1st place there. 2007 they were again relegated but came back in 2010.

Digital rights

Digital rights are the rights of people regarding what they can do with their computer. There are many cases that need special thought related to digital rights, such as the right to have data accessible to a few people (privacy) and freedom of expression. Very often the word is used when referring to computer networks such as the Internet.

In 2003, the United Nations held a special talk, called the World Summit on the Information Society. One of the tasks of this talk was to make the digital divide smaller. The digital divide separates countries into "rich" ones and "poor" ones. For "poor" countries accessing the internet is much more hard. After long talks, all people in the talk signed a closing statement.

The statement pointed out that human rights were universal, and that they could not be divided. They were also related to the basic freedoms that the Vienna Declaration had defined, and could not be separated from them. In addition, democracy as well as sustainable development should be respected and the rule of law should be made stronger.

This declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression in the "Information Society". It says:
"We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information Society, and as outlined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organization. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits of the Information Society offers."
Digital rights management is in this area, as an example.



Enigma machine

The Enigma machine was created for Germany by Arthur Scherbius in World War I. It is a cypher machine: changing the letters of a message so that it appears to be random letters. Enigmas were among the most-used kind of cypher machines for the German military in World War II.

Each time a letter is typed, it appears as another letter in the alphabet. The choices are "not" random. They are decided by a series of rotors which are set each day to a different starting set-up. Every press of a key turns the rotors to a new position.

German military messages done on the Enigma machine were first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau, beginning in December 1932. Later, they designed mechanical devices for breaking Enigma cyphers. From 1938 more complexity was added to the Enigma machines, making decryption more difficult.

On 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Poles showed French and British intelligence agents their cryptanalysis of the Enigma, and promised each delegation a Polish-built Enigma. The demonstration was a vital start for the later British work at Bletchley Park.

During the invasion of Poland (1939) the Polish codebreakers were sent to France for safety. Later, they fled to Britain. Making technical improvements, British codebreakers solved a vast number of messages from Enigma, and gave the plaintext to military staff. The information gained from this team, called "Ultra" by the British, was a great help to the Allied war effort. Ultra also included decrypts of other German, Italian and Japanese cyphers and codes, including the cypher of the German High Command.

Mistakes by German operators helped the cryptanalysis of Luftwaffe Enigmas, and the British capture of key tables and a machine from a German submarine helped in cracking Navy ones.

On 15th July 2011, Queen Elizabeth II visited Bletchley Park, where the machine is kept in the Museum, to pay tribute to those who worked there, since they cut short the war by breaking the cyphers of Nazi Germany.

Northwest Passage

The Northwest Passage is a sea passage along the north coast of North America, through the Arctic Ocean. Because of ice, the passage is usually closed to ships. 

The Spanish Empire wanted to reach Asia by a western route, because Portugal controlled the eastern route around the Cape of Good Hope. Spain wanted to have a route that it could control. This caused most European countries to search for a possible route. Roald Amundsen was the first person to navigate the passage between 1903 and 1906.

Global warming is increasing the melting for the Passage.


Chatroulette

Chatroulette is a webcam chatting site founded by Andrei Ternowski in November 2009. Two people are randomly connected. At any time, one of the people can end the chat by pressing F9 on their keyboard. According to Robert J. Moore, the CEO and co-founder of RJMetrics, about 1 in 8 people are either naked or lewd.

The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is a 2009 Dutch horror movie. It is written and directed by Tom Six. The movie is about a mad doctor who wants to stick people together so they become what he calls his 'human centipede'.

"The Human Centipede" did not get very many good reviews, but Tom Six made two sequels to the movie called "The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)" and "The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence)".

Lindsay (played by Ashley C. Williams) and Jenny (played by Ashlynn Yennie) are two American girls who are on holiday in Germany. They are kidnapped by a mad doctor called Dr. Heiter (played by Dieter Laser) after their car breaks down and they go to his house to look for help. The doctor Heiter then kidnaps a Japanese man named Katsuro (played by Akihiro Kitamura). The doctor tells the three that he is world-famous for separating conjoined twins, but wants to join people together so they share a single digestive system. He tells the three how he will connect his three victims together mouth-to-anus. Lindsay tries to escape, but is captured before she can get away. The doctor then sews the three together; he sews Lindsays's mouth to Katsuro's anus, and Jenny's mouth to Lindsay's anus. This means that when he feeds Katsuro food, Katsuro defecates into Lindsay's mouth, and Lindsay defecates her feces into Jenny's mouth.

The doctor calls his victims his 'human centipede', and he tries to train his centipede as a pet. However, the doctor becomes very restless when he is kept awake by the screaming of his victims, and even more annoyed when Jenny starts to get ill from blood poisoning.

When the police visit the doctor to look for the missing people, he decides to add them to his centipede and get rid of Jenny. The doctor tries but fails to drug the detectives, and they leave the house saying they will come back later. The three try to escape, and Katsuro attacks the doctor, by stabbing him in the foot and leg, but they do not escape the house. Katsuro tells the doctor that he deserves his fate, because he had treated his family very badly in the past, then he kills himself with a piece of glass. The police come back to the house and search it, as the doctor hides near his swimming pool. One policeman finds the 'human centipede' but then hears a gunshot which he goes to investigate. He discovers the other policeman dead in the swimming pool. The doctor then shoots him in the stomach, and as he is dying he shoots the doctor in the head. The policeman then falls in the pool and is dead.

Jenny and Lindsay hold hands as Jenny dies from her blood poisoning. Lindsay is left alone in the house. The movie ends with her screaming into Heiter's empty laboratory, while still attached to Katsuro and Jenny.


Most reviews said "The Human Centipede" was not very good. However some Horror blogs liked the idea and thought it was funny.

The movie won some awards at Film Festivals.


Isle Royale National Park

Isle Royale National Park is a wildlife reserve on more than 100 islands in northwest Lake Superior, in northern Michigan in the United States. This national park was opened in 1940. The wildlife includes moose, wolves and many kinds of birds.

One of the islands is called Isle Royale. It has an area of 229 square miles. Native Americans mined copper on this island in pre-Columbian times (before 1492). The mines can still be seen here.

Mare Tranquillitatis

Mare Tranquillitatis is a large area on the visible side of the Moon. It is also called the Sea of Tranquillity. It is called a sea because ancient astronomers looked at the Moon and thought they saw seas and oceans on the Moon. Now we know that they are not seas. They are darkened areas on the Moon's surface. They may have been made by ancient volcanoes by things such as leaks and eruptions. Mare Tranquillitatis is just one of the 22 "Seas" and "Oceans" on the Moon.

In 1651, astronomers Francesco Grimaldi and Giovanni Battista Riccioli named Mare Tranquillitatis in their lunar map.

Mare Tranquillitatis was the landing site for the first manned landing on the Moon on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC. Apollo 11 landed at .

Heterodontosaur

The Heterodontosauridae ("different-toothed lizards") is a family of early ornithischian dinosaurs.

They have often been considered basal ornithopods, although recent studies suggest they may have been more closely related to marginocephalians. Although their fossils are rare, they lived around the globe beginning in the Upper Triassic and may have persisted into the Lower Cretaceous.

A large gap, called a diastema, separated the premaxillary teeth from the those of the maxilla (the main upper jaw bone) in many ornithischia, but this diastema was arched in heterodontosaurs. 

The mandible (lower jaw) was tipped by the predentary, a bone unique to ornithischia. This bone also supported a beak similar to the one found on the premaxilla. All the teeth in the lower jaw were found on the dentary bone.

Heterodontosaurids are called that because they have two different kinds of teeth. There were three premaxillary teeth. In the early Jurassic "Abrictosaurus", "Heterodontosaurus", and "Lycorhinus", the first two premaxillary teeth were small and conical, while the much larger third tooth resembled the canines of carnivoran mammals and is often called the "caniniform" or 'tusk'. 

Several early studies suggested that heterodontosaurs were primitive ornithischians. The main hypothesis in recent years has put heterodontosaurids in as basal ornithopods. However, others have suggested that heterodontosaurs share a common ancestor with Marginocephalia (ceratopsians and pachycephalosaurs). This has support from some recent studies. A clade containing heterodontosaurs and marginocephalians has been named Heterodontosauriformes. Heterodontosaurs may even be basal to both ornithopods and marginocephalians. In 2007, a cladistic analysis suggested that heterodontosaurs are basal to all known ornithischians except "Pisanosaurus", a result that echoes some of the very earliest work on the family.

Pterygota

Pterygota is a subclass of insects that includes the winged insects. It also includes insect orders that are secondarily wingless. That means insect groups whose ancestors once had wings but that have lost them later in evolution.

The Pterygota today includes almost all insects. That is because flying led to a great radiation of insect types. The groups without flight are in the Apterygota.

In the Pterygota, are the Palaeoptera and the Neoptera. The Palaeoptera is paraphyletic, and its classification is being discussed. Likewise the Exopterygota. There are no agreed alternatives at present, so the taxonomy is left in its traditional form.

The Endopterygota is made up of all the insects which have complete metamorphosis. It is agreed to be a good monophyletic clade, even though some of the details may need to be adjusted.

Robert Schuman

Robert Schuman (29 June 1886 – 4 September 1963) was a famous French politician. Schuman was a politician with the "Mouvement Républicain Populaire" (Popular Republican Movement) party which is a French Christian Democrat party. Schuman was also an independent political thinker and activist. He was twice Prime Minister of France. He also served as Minister of Finance and Foreign Minister. He was an important person in Europe after World War 2, and worked on creating European and trans-Atlantic institutions. He is regarded as one of the founders of the European Union, the Council of Europe and NATO.

Neoptera

Neoptera is a classification group that has almost all the winged insects, mostly those that can flex their wings over their abdomens. This is in contrast with the more basal orders of winged insects, which are not able to flex their wings in this way.

The Neoptera can be contrasted with the Palaeoptera, the 'ancient-winged' insects, which include the Odonata, the Ephemeroptera and extinct groups such as the Palaeodictyoptera.

Endopterygota

The Endopterygota (or Holometabola), are insects of the subclass Pterygota.

They have complete metamorphosis. This means they go through different larval, pupal, and adult stages. The larval and adult stages differ very much in their anatomy and behavior. This is called holometabolism, or complete metamorphism.

They are distinguished from the Exopterygota (or Hemipterodea) by the way in which their wings develop. Endopterygota ("internal winged forms") develop wings inside the body during metamorphosis.

The earliest endopterygote fossils date from the Carboniferous.

The Vienna Declaration was a statement to reinforce the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Charter. This led to the starting of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. It was adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993.

The main principle is that "all human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated." (Part I para 5) This means that the international community must treat all matters about human rights both economic, social and cultural rights and civil rights equallly and with the same importance without exceptions. This phase is cited also by Declaration of Montreal, Yogyakarta Principles and Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

This Declaration aims at full realization of all human rights and freedoms without any discrimination such as racism, xenophobia, being in immigration, migrant workers, indigenous, ethnic or minority group, with tolerance and also affirm the human rights of women, child against all child abuse; child labour, child soldier, child prostitution, child pornography and any form of human trafficking, unfree prostitution, sexual slavery and against inhuman use of any weapons of war, especially the landmine, and also arrims the human rights of persons with disabilities. 

To realize all human rights, this Declaration demands all countries to ratify fully all treaties on human rights as much as possible and to make effective legal system to give remedy for human rights violations are indispensable to democracy and sustainable development not only the fair and full realization of human rights.

And appeals to the States which do not recognize formally the Geneva Conventions, to take necessary action to realize all human rights.

Nihon Odai Ichiran

A French translation of "Nihon Ōdai Ichiran" ("Annales des empereurs du Japon") was published in 1834. It was translated by a Dutchman Isaac Titsingh ; this translation was one of very few books about Japan of the time.

Dutch historian Isaac Titsingh brought the seven volumes of the book with him when he returned to Europe in 1797. He returned after twenty years in Asia. Titsingh's French translation was published in 1834. The Japanese originals were lost in the 19th century wars in Europe. 

This was the first major history of Japan to be published in the West. It was also the first history book by a Japanese writer to be published in Europe.

Isaac Titsingh described "Nihon odai ichiran" as a very difficult book. He thought that the translation was "a most tedious task."

In the 1950s, "Ōdai-ichiran" was evaluated by Japanologist John Whitney Hall who confirmed Titsingh's work is a careful translation from Japanese sources.

Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People

Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People (abbreviated SBCG4AP) is an episodic series of point-and-click adventure games developed by Telltale Games based on the Homestar Runner web cartoon and starring Strong Bad. The five episodes include Homestar Ruiner, Strong Badia the Free, Baddest of the Bands, Dangeresque 3: The Criminal Projective, and 8-Bit is Enough.

Strong Bad

Strong Bad is one of the major characters of the "Homestar Runner" series of animated surreal comedy Flash web cartoons. He is portrayed by Matt Chapman, the principal voice actor and co-founder of the series. Strong Bad enjoys pranking the other characters of the series, along with his ever-diligent lackey pet named "The Cheat" and his older brother Strong Mad. The main segment that Strong Bad is a part of is ""Strong Bad Email"", in which he answers emails sent to him by fans. "Strong Bad Email" has turned into several DVDs, as well as a podcast, since its first episode in 2001.

Strong Bad is sometimes referred to as the main antagonist of the series due to his pranks that he, Strong Mad, and The Cheat play on the other characters, and his insulting of his brother Strong Sad. He seems to be a character influenced by the American popular culture trends of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, 
such as heavy metal music and the second and third generations of video games and video game consoles. Since he is one of the site's most popular characters, merchandise has also spun off of Strong Bad, which includes t-shirts and sweatshirts sold by the website.

Strong Bad has been one of the series most popular characters, and has been well received. In an article by National Review Online, Strong Bad was described as "a non-stop braggart, liar, manipulator, and egotist", but also "one of the coolest characters on the Internet and the real star of Homestarrunner.com, which may be the most popular homegrown animation in the world". Segments have been spun off of his emails, including "Teen Girl Squad" a comic drawn by Strong Bad about four teenage friends.

Old Style and New Style dates

Old Style (or O.S.) and New Style (or N.S.) are terms used for calendar dates in English language historical studies, for two reasons. The first reason is that the method of dating that is most widely used around the world today, the Gregorian calendar, was introduced into English cultures only in 1752. The second is that 1 January has not always been the first day of the year: in the British Empire (and some other countries), March 25th was the start of the year. Both of these conventions changed just a few centuries ago, when the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 was made law. The dating style used before 1752Julian Calendar, year beginning 25 March is called Old Style Dating and the dating style used todayGregorian Calendar, year beginning 1 January is called New Style Dating. So when a date is given in a history book (or an old book), we need to know whether it is using 'New Style' or 'Old Style' dating. During the time of the changeover, people would give both dates. Even today, when historians are writing about an event in those times, they often give the date as it was used at the time but also give the modern equivalent for your convenience. 

The reason for changing the calendar was that people realised that there is a mistake in the Julian calendar, that it adds too many leap years. This meant that the date of Easter was being calculated wrongly, because it depends on March 21 being the day before the equinox. So they designed a new calendar that corrected this error. The new rule was that a leap year would happen every four years (as before) "but not" if the year ended in 00 "unless" it could be divided evenly by 400. (So 1600 and 2000 were leap years, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not.) Pope Gregory XIII had declared that this new calendar should be used from 1582 onwards. But only Roman Catholic countries accepted this ruling: Protestant and Eastern Orthodox countries refused to have the Pope tell them what to do. So even in Europe, the change happened at different times.

For example, it was not until 1752 that Great Britain and its colonies changed over to the new calendar, also changing the start of the year from 25 March to 1 January at the same time. Russia changed in 1918, after the 'October' Revolution.

The Latin words for O.S. are "stili veteris" or "stilo vetere". These terms are used in some books worldwide. They can be shortened to "st.v".

In Europe and its colonies, the 'old style calendar' means the Julian calendar. Other countries used different systems: for example China, Japan and Korea used lunisolar calendars. 

Clarence S. Campbell Bowl

The Clarence S. Campbell Bowl is a National Hockey League (NHL) trophy awarded to the Western Conference playoff champions. The trophy is named for Clarence S. Campbell to honor his work for the NHL. He was the president of the NHL from 1946 to 1977. The trophy is a made of sterling silver. It was made by a British silversmith in 1878. 

The trophy was first awarded in 1968 to the regular-season champions of the West Division. Starting in 1975, the trophy was awarded to the regular-season winner of the Campbell Conference. Starting in 1982, the trophy was awarded to the playoff champion in the Campbell Conference. Since 1994, the trophy has been awarded to the playoff champion in the Western Conference.

A traditional supersitition that is prevalent among many of today's NHL players is that no player should either touch or lift the Campbell (Western Conference champion) or Prince of Wales (Eastern Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; the players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that they should be hoisting.

Nilüfer, Bursa

Nilüfer is a district of Bursa Province of Turkey.

Vuvuzela

A vuvuzela is a blowing horn commonly used in soccer games in South Africa. They are also called lepatas or a stadium horn. To blow this horn, the lip and lung strength of the blower has to be strong to make a sound like a foghorn or an elephant.

The "vuvuzela" was originally made out of tin. It became very popular in South Africa in the 1990s. A fan of the Kaizer Chiefs FC named Freddie "Saddam" Maake says that he invented the vuvuzela. He got the idea from the aluminium 1965 bicycle horn, and after taking off the black rubber, he blew it. After that, he thought it was too short, and so he joined a pipe to make it longer. He has kept photos of himself in South African soccer games holding the aluminium vuvuzela. He says the instrument was not allowed to be used because it was thought of as a dangerous weapon. Because of this, he tried to find a plastic company that could make it safer.

In 2001, South Africa-based company Masincedane Sport began to sell the plastic version. Neil van Schalkwyk, the co-owner of Masincedane Sport, won the SAB KickStart Award in 2001.

Vuvuzelas have been said to be rooted in African history, but this is argued between many historians. South African people used to blow on a kudu horn to call villagers to a meeting. Also, there is a South African saying that "A baboon is killed by a lot of noise." Similar horns have been made for a long time by many people. A horn that looks identical to a vuvuzela is seen in Winslow Homer's woodcut "The Dinner Horn" from the 1870s.

In the 2010 World Cup, vuvuzelas were in the news all over the world because it was normal in South Africa for them to be blown at football matches. The world football governing body, FIFA, did not want to allow the use of vuvuzelas. This was because they were afraid that hooligans might use the instrument as a weapon and that businesses could put advertisements on vuvuzelas. However the South African Football Association (SAFA) said that vuvuzelas were important for South African games, and FIFA decided in July 2008 to let the instruments be used.

Some football players and audiences did not like the vuvuzelas. The Lee Dixon of the BBC Three said that the sounds were "quite irritating". The European broadcasters also complained to the FIFA that they could not hear the commentators because of the sound.

Vuvuzelas have also caused problems. With a Vuvuzela, high sound pressure levels can be reached. These are about 120 dB(A) at a distance of one metre, and about 191 db(A) next to the instrument. There have been moves to prohibit the use of vuvuzelas in certain public viewing areas, because they can damage hearing, and because their sound may be louder than that of emergency broadcasts. Demand for earplugs to protect from hearing loss during the World Cup was bigger than the available supply. Many pharmacies ran out of stock. Neil van Schalkwyk, manufacturer of the plastic vuvuzela, began selling earplugs to fans. After the World Cup 2010 vuvuzelas started to be banned in other countries. In Britain Tottenham Hotspur was the first football team to ban them in July 2010, and many other football teams have since followed. They were banned because of health and safety reasons, especially because it was said that people might not hear any safety announcements.

Web accessibility

Web accessibility is how easy it is to use the internet for people with disabilities. 

This can be different types of disabilities. For example, websites might have important information in a sound file with somebody reading it out loud, which would make it possible for people who are blind or who have trouble seeing to get the information. Another way of making a website more accessible would be to remove an image with flashing lights, because such images could give some people seizures.


Brachiosaur

Brachiosaurs are a family of sauropod dinosaurs, the Brachiosauridae. They were herbivorous quadrupeds with longer forelegs than hind legs. As a result, there is also some dispute about which animals belong within this family.

The largest mounted skeleton in the world is a brachiosaur, the "Giraffatitan brancai" (formerly "Brachiosaurus brancai") at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany.

Brachiosaurs first evolved in the Middle Jurassic, and died out at the end of the Lower Cretaceous, surviving for about 60 million years. The earliest known brachiosaur may be "" from the Middle Jurassic of Africa. The giant "Sauroposeidon" from North America was one of the last brachiosaurs, living just before the end of the Early Cretaceous period. 

The name "brachiosaur" means "arm lizard", which may sound like a strange name for a four-legged animal. The family Brachiosauridae was given this name because the dinosaurs in it tended to have longer "arms" (front legs) than back legs.

Brachiosaurs have been featured in many works of popular culture, particularly the type genus, "Brachiosaurus". "Brachiosaurus" was featured in the 1993 film "Jurassic Park", as well as the 2000 Disney film "". The brachiosaur "Astrodon" is the state dinosaur of Maryland. It was featured in paleontologist Robert T. Bakker's novel Raptor Red, where it was portrayed as a prey item of the dromaeosaur "Utahraptor".

Giraffatitan

Giraffatitan ("giraffe titan") is a genus of sauropod dinosaurs. It lived during the Upper Jurassic, about 140 million years ago. It was related to "Brachiosaurus", and was one of the largest animals known to have walked the Earth.

Giraffatitans were about long and weighed about . They had very long necks. They were obviously adapted for feeding on tall conifers. These were the main trees in the Jurassic forests. They lived in what is now Tanzania.

The specimen was first named as an African species of "Brachiosaurus" ("B. brancai") in 1914. In 1991, George Olshevsky said there were enough differences to make its own genus, creating "Giraffatitan".

Several giant titanosaurians appear to surpass "Giraffatitan" in sheer mass. However, "Giraffatitan" and "Brachiosaurus" are still the largest brachiosaurid sauropods known from relatively complete material.

All size estimates for "Giraffatitan" are based on the skeleton mounted in Berlin, which is partly constructed from authentic bones. These were largely taken from specimen HMN SII, a subadult individual between in length and about twelve meters (forty feet) tall.

However, landfall was reached in North America on 24 June 1497. His precise landing-place is a matter of much controversy, with Cape Bonavista or St. John's in Newfoundland the most likely sites.

Object (grammar)

An object in grammar is the target of an action, and occurs in any sentence with a transitive verb. It is an element in the clause which follows the verb, as in:

These are direct objects. The following are indirect objects:
The structure of these sentences is (S/V/O/O) where S = subject, V = verb and O = object. The first object is an "indirect object", the second is a "direct object". Notice that, in the last example, you sent a letter, not your son. The sentence makes perfect sense without the indirect object.

An equivalent sentence to the last example is:
Here some grammarians also see "son" as the indirect object ("letter" is the term which cannot be left out).

Subject (grammar)

The subject in grammar is the agent (the 'doer') in an active sentence such as: "Alan kissed Jane".

However, there is a difficulty. The following two sentences are identical in meaning:
Only in the first sentence is "our children" the grammatical subject. So there is a difference between the logical subject and the grammatical subject. Also, many sentences have no subject, for instance:

If a sentence does have a subject, then the rest of the sentence may be called the "predicate". 

Frigate

A frigate () is a warship. The term has been used for warships of many sizes and roles for a few centuries. During the age of sail they were small, agile ships that were extensively used in the American War of Independence, and later against the British. Their main use was shore defense.

In the modern day the term "Frigate" covers a broad range of ships. This is primarily for political reasons. The generally accepted term is of a warship less that 6, 000 dwt and greater that around 2, 000 dwt. Its primary purpose is usually anti-submarine warfare. It can also be a long range patrol vessel or in smaller navies an anti-air vessel.

Eugène Gigout

Eugène Gigout (23 March 1844 – 9 December 1925) was a French organist and composer of European late-romantic music for organ.

Gigout was born in Nancy, and died in Paris.

A student of Camille Saint-Saëns, he served as the organist of Saint-Augustin Church in Paris for 62 years. He became known as a teacher. Also, his output as a composer was large and of high quality. Renowned as an expert improviser, he also founded his own music school. His nephew-by-marriage, Leon Boëllmann, became another fine organist and composer for the organ (but died at the very young age of 35).

The "10 pièces pour orgue", composed in 1890, are Gigout's most famous compositions. They are the "Toccata in B minor", his best-known composition, which turns up as a common encore at organ concerts. Also fairly often performed, and to be found in the same collection, is a "Scherzo in E major".

Other compositions by Gigout sometimes played nowadays are "Grand Choeur Dialogué" and "Marche Religieuse". Gigout's works are now available on many commercial recordings.

Schola Cantorum

La Schola Cantorum is a private music school in Paris. It was started in 1894 by Charles Bordes, Alexandre Guilmant and Vincent d'Indy. It was to make up for the Paris Conservatoire's emphasis on opera. Its past students are many significant figures in 20 century music.

Voice (grammar)

Voice in grammar expresses the way the action (or state) that the verb expresses relates to the subject or object. 

In English grammar, there are two voices: "active" and "passive". When a clause is in the active voice, the subject is the doer of the action. When a clause is in the passive voice, the subject is the receiver of the action. The active voice is much more commonly used than the passive voice.


This example shows how the word order changes the emphasis of the sentence. The first clearly answers the question "Who chose the furniture?" The second is more of an incidental comment.

The active voice is usually easier to say, and easier to understand than the passive voice. When a person learns a language, it is learnt first, and uses fewer words than the passive voice. Therefore, given an equal choice, the active voice is usually chosen.

Transitivity (mathematics)

In logic and mathematics, transitivity is a property of a binary relation. It is a prerequisite of an equivalence relation and of a partial order.

In general, given a set with a relation, the relation is transitive if whenever a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c. For example:


Given a relation formula_1, the smallest transitive relation containing formula_1 is called the transitive closure of formula_1, and is written as formula_4.


Beer Sheba

Beer Sheba is a city on the northern edge of the Negev region in Israel. It is the home of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.


Desert scorpion

The desert scorpion ("Hadrurus arizonensis") is the largest scorpion in North America. It reaches a length of .

Scorpions are arachnids, with eight legs. Their body has two body parts, called abdomen and cepholothorax.

The desert scorpion’s habitat is the desert. It is a warm place where the hottest days can reach . Desert scorpions range is south west. In extreme weather conditions, the extra layer of fat under scorpion’s exoskeleton helps it to survive. It lives in sandy places in the desert like sand dunes.

It is a burrowing scorpion, but often found under rocks. Its diet consists of large insects, spiders, and small vertebrates. This is an aggressive and active scorpion. Like all scorpions, it is nocturnal. Also like all scorpions, the giant desert hairy scorpion gives birth to live young, which stay on the mother's back for a week or more before leaving.


Black widow

Black widows are spiders. Their scientific name is "Latrodectus mactans". They share the genus name "Latrodectus" with several similar spiders (sometimes called "widow spiders"). 

The female spider is shiny black and has a round abdomen with a red hourglass pattern on its underside. They are closely related to another group called "Steatoda" (sometimes called "false widow spiders). That group contains species that are not dangerous to humans. All of the true widow spiders can give bites that are harmful to human beings and may kill children or people who are not in good health.

Female widow spiders are rather large. They have a body length of approximately 0.5 inch. The males of the widow spiders are much smaller than the females.

Both the widow spiders and the "Steatoda" spiders belong to a larger group that includes many kinds of spiders that make similar kinds of webs and have the same general body shape.

Black widow spiders live in warm places all over the world. They like to build their webs in safe places under something like an overturned box sitting on the ground. Often they are found under the seats of outdoor toilets. They like to be left alone, so they rarely come inside places where people live.

Like other spiders, black widows bite for two reasons: to kill things to eat and to protect themselves. They catch flying insects in their webs and bite them so that they will stop fighting to get free. When people put their hands into this spider's web they might get bitten by mistake, but usually people get bitten when they squeeze a spider and the spider defends itself. Unfortunately, humans are very sensitive to the venom that the spider gives in its bite. The good thing is that widow spiders almost always run away if they can. If something big hits their web then they drop straight down to the ground and run away.

Black widows eat mostly flies and moths. The female black widow is infamous for eating males of its kind, hence the "widow" in black.


Pill bug

Armadillidiidae is a family of woodlice, a terrestrial crustacean group in the order Isopoda. They are commonly known as pill bugs or potato bugs or rollie pollies. Pill bugs are not insects, but are crustaceans. Crustaceans are animals with hard shells made from many pieces for protection.

Pill bugs look like gray pills. The pill bug's abdomen has seven segments. Pill bugs have flat bodies. The pill bug has three basic body parts called the head, thorax, and abdomen, moce and they can be many sizes.

The head has three eyes (simple and compound) and a mouth. Pill bugs have two sets of antennae. One of the sets is visible to see. The thorax holds the legs. The abdomen holds the exopods of uropods and is attached to some crustaceans' abdomens. Pillbugs eat rotten plants, rotten animals, old garbage, and even bits of food in animal dung. Pill bugs do not breathe through lungs; they have gills. Because of this, they need to be in a damp place or they will die. They also prefer dark rocks or any other dark place to stay that is dark. They are more active at night and early morning because of the darkness. Pill bugs are not beneficial to potted plants. If you notice your potted plants have one or two of them crawling around on the plant, there are probably many more that you don't see feeding off of the roots.

Pill bugs have the typical lifespan of an Isopod, living two years average and five years maximum.
The Pill bugs come from a family called Armadillidiidae. 

For some people, looking for Pill Bugs in their garden is helpful to their garden and also enjoyable, especially for small children. To some people, keeping Pill Bugs as pets is also an enjoyable thing. To keep a Pill Bug as a pet, it's area which it is kept in must be moist and/or damp, with plants that are fresh and plants that have begun to rot. Pill Bugs are still garden animals so please remember you cannot keep them or their full life and should never, under any circumstances, be released back into the wild once rescued.

Druze

Druze (; ; "Durūz," plural "Druzes") is an Arab religious sect and community. It is estimated that there are more than 1 million Druzes in the world today, and most of them live in the Middle Eastern countries, especially in Lebanon and Syria. There are some smaller Druze communities around the world. 'Druze' is the name given to the community by outsiders, and the term is not used by Druzes themselves. Instead, they call themselves "muwaḥḥidūn" (“unitarians”). Druze’s origin is Shi'i Islam of Fatimad dynasty, but Druzes hold distinctive beliefs and practices and put much emphasis on philosophy and spirituality. 

It is believed that the origin of Druze comes from Fatimid dynasty in Egypt in the 11th century. Because Fatimas were derived of Shi’a Islam called Isma’ilis, the root of Druze is also the branch of Shi’a. The sixth caliph of Fatimid dynasty, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, played an important role to elaborate the Druze doctrine. In Druze manuscript, he is regarded as the founder of Druze.

In 1016, a Persian man called Hamza Ibn 'Ali came to Cairo to help al-Hakim. At that time, al-Hakim attempted to spread the belief of Druze. In 1017, al-Hakim designated Hamza as an imam, and Hamza especially contributed to elaborate the Druze doctrine and to spread the belief by sending missionaries.

There was conflict over the Druze doctrine between Hamza and Muḥammad al-Darāzī. Darāzī was also a Druze missionary who arrived in Cairo in 1016. He offered his service to al-Hakim and was recruited as a missionary. In order to get more support from al-Hakim than Hamza, Darāzī began to alter the teaching by Hamza and declared that the presence of al-Hakim is divine. However, al-Hakim did not appreciate it and people began to criticise Darāzī’s corrupted teachings. In 1019, Darāzī is said to be executed or killed.

In 1021, al-Hakim disappeared suddenly during his trip to the east Cairo for reasons unknown. After his disappearance, his successor of Fatimad caliph al-Zāḥir oppressed the Druze movement to spread its doctrine. Druze gradually fell into decline in Egypt, but in Syria and Lebanon the belivers remained because of the effort by the missionaries.

In 1043, the Druze doctrine prohibited its believers from believing other religion and outsiders from becoming a new member of Druze. Since then, Druze has been the closed community and has kept the policy until now. 

The term "Druze" was given to the community by outsiders. They apparently mixed up Muḥammad al-Darāzī, one of the early missionaries of Druze, as the founder of the religion. However, because of his misbehavior, Druzes and its manuscripts regard Darāzī as the first betrayer. Therefore, the term never used in the Druze manuscripts and the members reject using it. Instead, the Druzes call themselves "Muwwahhidun," meaning 'Unitarians'.

Within the Druze community, the strict religious authority exists. The religious elite has a huge impact on the rest of the people, and that makes the community members closely united. There are two main classes in Druze community: the initiated or wise ("'uqqal") and the uninitiated or ignorant ("juhhal"). The duty of the initiated is telling its mystical, complex teaching and oral traditions to the uninitiated. The initiated study the Druze’s belief by discussing and reading its holy scripture in a prayer house ("khalwa" or "majlis"). In order to become the initiated, it is required to show deep respect and dedication to the God and to go through the long process of application. Women also have the chance to become the initiated. According to Druze doctrine, women are more spiritually matured than men, so women are required to take less-severe training to become the initiated. The initiated people are easily recognised because of their dark clothes with white and rounded turbans.

According to the Druze manuscripts, after the someone’s dead, the soul is soon incarnated, meaning the soul gets a new human body and reborns as a different person. A soul is incarnated without changing its religion, skin colour or race, so a Druze reborns as a Druze over time. This idea comes from one of the Druze doctrines that the number of Druze souls is constant.

For Druzes, it is quite rare and strongly discouraged to get married with a non-Druze person in order to maintain the religious teaching secret from outsiders. In addition, because only a child whose parents are both Druze is accepted as a Druze, the marriage within Druze community is important to prevent the number of Druzes from decreasing. But nowadays for many young Druzes living in a small community outside the Middle East have difficulty finding their Druze partner.

The Druze worship places are called "majlis" or "khalwa". Druzes worship there normally on Thursday evenings. Both the initiated and the uninitiated join the gathering. There, some religious ceremonies such as spiritual readings and prayer are conducted under the direction of the initiated. After the open session is over, the uninitiated leave the hall and only some initiated are permitted to remain there and join a limited session. There, they discuss and meditate mystical reading and transcription.

The Druze flag and its symbol star have the same five colours and each colour has two meanings: spiritual principles and key figures. In the Druze manuscript, there are five people who are respected by their contribution to Druze, and five cosmic spiritual elements that are main principles of existence for Druzes.

The majority of Druzes are living in the Middle East, especially in Lebanon and Syria. Because of the economic and political instability, some Druzes emigrated outside the Middle East and small communities are found in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America and Australia. However, because of its strong feeling of unity, they are closely related to their hometown and companions.

In Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, the legal and administrative center of Druze is located. Over 300,000 Druze are living in Lebanon, which is around 7% of the total population of the country. The western edges of the Lebanon Mountains is the most populated area of Druzes. Since the independence of Lebanon, Druze has kept much power for the country’s politics.

There are around 600,000 Druze in Syria and the country has the largest population of Druze in the world. Around 6% of the Syrian population is Druze. Suwayda, the city located in the area of Jabal al-Durūz, holds the huge number of Druzes. In 1925, Druze leader Sulṭān al-Aṭrash rose a rebellion against French rule and it was considered to be the first nationalist movement in Syria.

The population of Druze in Israel is less than 1% of the total population, but the Druze's contribution to the Israeli government is not small. Although Druze is an Arab community, theyl are patriotic citizens and many have been fighting for Israel against Palestine.

Ready to Fall

"Ready to Fall" is the first single by melodic hardcore band Rise Against from their fourth studio album, "The Sufferer & The Witness" (2006).

An acoustic version of this song was done live on the CJZN Radio station in Victoria, British Columbia, on January 18, 2007, before a Billy Talent concert featuring Rise Against, Anti-Flag, and Moneen.

On March 12, 2009, the song became a downloadable song in the video game, "Guitar Hero World Tour". It is also shown in Tap Tap Revenge 3 on the iPhone and iPod Touch as a downloadable double song pack with Audience of One. The song was also shown in 2009 action movie 12 Rounds.

The video was made in 2006. It is about pollution and its effects on the environment. The video is 3 minutes and 52 seconds long. It cuts between shots of the band playing and shots of animals being saved or dying, if not already dead. This is from many environmental dangers made by humans. At the end of the video, lead singer Tim McIlrath says, "Every action has a reaction. We've got one planet, one chance."

There was also a version played on television. There are also ones that are more graphic. This was never really released. But it is available on some websites. The video serves a testimony to veganism. Rise Against is an active supporter of PETA, an animal rights organization, and the band members are all active vegetarians.

The song got to number 13 on the "Billboard" Modern Rock Tracks chart. It is the lowest charting single from "The Sufferer & the Witness". Although, it was the band's second highest charting single.

Soccer City

Soccer City is a sports stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was first built in 1987. At that time, it was named the FNB Stadium.

In 2009, the stadium was improved. More seats were added. New locker (dressing) rooms and new floodlights were built.

The stadium co-hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup. It is one of the 10 stadiums where World Cup matches were played.

2010 World Cup Matches

All times are given in South African Standard time (UTC+2).
On June 29, the South African government announced that a memorial service for Nelson Mandela would be held 10 to 14 days after his death at Soccer City. Mandela died on December 5, 2013 and a memorial service was held at Soccer City.

FNB Stadium is mostly used for concerts and local 5-a-side tournaments. When South Africa's most popular soccer team, the [Kaizer Chiefs] play in the stadium, they attract approximately 15,000 fans, during rival soccer matches and derbies they attract approximately more than 75 000 fans when they play there among the rotating venues that they use.


Acacia

Acacia is a genus of shrub or tree are belonging to the subfamily Mimosoideae of the family Fabaceae, first described in Africa by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in 1773. Many non-Australian species tend to be thorny, whereas the majority of Australian Acacias are not. 

Acacias are heavily defended against herbivores. Different species have different combinations of defenses:

Products from the acacia plants have often been used for medicinal purposes.

Various species of acacia yield gum. True gum arabic is the product of "Acacia senegal", abundant in dry tropical West Africa from Senegal to northern Nigeria.

"Acacia arabica" is the gum-Arabic tree of India, but yields a gum inferior to the true gum-Arabic.

This species of acacia grows two kinds of thorns. The main defense is provided by pairs 5cm long arranged nearly at a right angle. Smaller stipular spines grow between the pairs of big thorns. These emerge from hollow galls, bulbous swellings 2 to 3cm across. One of four different species of ant lives in each of these igloos, which they open up by cutting holes into them. A dying bush whistles as the wind blows over these entrances. Most acacias make toxins that rush to leaves that are under attack by browsers. The whistling thorn does not. It is infested with stinging ants that swarm out and prepare to bite anything they can when the branch is disturbed. Most browsers seem to avoid infested bushes, perhaps because the ants stink of formic acid.

Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts

Many East Asian scripts can be written both horizontally and vertically.

Documents around the world have many different ways of writing. But there are mainly two ways of writing: writing horizontally (횡서, 橫書) or vertically (종서縱書). There are two kinds of horizontal writing. One kind can be read from left to right (좌횡서, 左橫書); the other is read from right to left (우횡서, 右橫書). There are two kinds of vertical writing as well: from left to right (좌정서, 左縱書) or from right to left (우정서, 右縱書), both of these are written from top to bottom. Traditionally, the countries in the East Asian cultural sphere (such as Korea, China, Japan or Vietnam) write vertically from right to left. When it was necessary to write horizontally, they wrote horizontally from right to left. When the Western culture began influencing them, they began writing horizontally from left to right, which is now used widely.

Most Western languages are written horizontally from left to right, but Arabic and Hebrew are written horizontally from right to left. Mongol letters are written horizontally from left to right.

Long ago, people used hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs were very flexible characters. They were often written from left to right in the first line, and then right to left in the second line, and so on. This is called boustrophedon. A person can tell which direction to read by which direction the hieroglyphs of animals and people were facing. If the hieroglyphs were facing left, then the line must be read from left to right. If they were facing right, they must be read from right to left.



Mimosoideae

Mimosoideae is a subfamily of the flowering plant family Fabaceae. Members of this family usually have flowers with small petals and many stamens. 

Some classification systems, for example the Cronquist system, treat Fabaceae in a narrow sense, raising Mimosoideae to the rank of family as Mimosaceae. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group treats Fabaceae in the broad sense.

Affix

An affix is a piece added to a word, or root, which signals or changes its role in a sentence. It is part of grammar. Affixes may occur in various positions in a word:


Enigma

Enigma may refer to:


New Caledonia national football team

New Caledonia national football team is the national football team of New Caledonia.

Midshipman

A midshipman is an officer cadet, or a commissioned officer. They are the lowest rank of officer in the Royal Navy, United States Navy, and many Commonwealth navies. Commonwealth countries which use this rank are Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, India, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Kenya. Before 1968, it was used by the Royal Canadian Navy. But it was replaced with that of naval cadet upon the making of the Canadian Forces.

Impressionist music

The impressionist movement in music was a movement in Europen classical music. It was mostly in France. It began in the late 19th century and ended in the middle of the 20th century. There were two very famous composers of this movement, Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. Debussy actually did not like the term 'Impressionist' in his works. English impressionist musicians include Cyril Scott (1879–1970) and John Ireland (1879–1962). Other well-known composers labeled impressionist include Paul Dukas, Gabriel Fauré, Manuel de Falla, Isaac Albéniz, Giacomo Puccini, Leoš Janáček, Alexander Scriabin and Kurt Atterberg

The first pieces of impressionist music were probably composed by Franz Liszt, the first such piece for orchestra is probably Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, composed by Claude Debussy, between 1892 and 1894.

The impressionism of Debussy is achieved through a number of means the overall aim of which were to weaken the teleological (Purpose driven) harmonic structure of classical (functional) western harmony. In functional harmony a path is set that leads inexorably to a final cadence at which the tonic is clearly affirmed, dissonance whether through the use of suspensions or 7th chords etc. is correctly prepared and then resolved creating a flow of tension and release. By contrast, many of Debussy's dissonances simply flow onto another dissonance in chains of seventh chords etc. Another way that Debussy holds tonality in suspense is through the use of the pentatonic and whole-tone scales in both melody and harmony. The story of modernist music has been a response to the extreme chromaticism of radical romantic composers such as Wagner and Liszt. The ones who felt compelled to complete the task took music to the chromatic extreme of atonality, others found ways to continue to write music using recognisable harmonic sequences and tonal (therefore recallable) melody by emancipating the dissonance and freeing it from its functional straightjacket. Debussy played a massive part in developing the vocabulary for this kind of composition. All non-atonal composers of the modernist era owe a debt to Debussy, including Stravinsky, Bartok, Messiaen and possibly even Steve Reich.


Neoclassicism music

Neoclassicism in music was popular in the twentieth-century. Mostly between the two World Wars. This kind of music is when composers try to come back to beautiful ways with the broadly defined way of "classicism", namely order, balance, clarity, economy, and emotions. Neoclassicism had two distinct national lines of development. They were French and German. Neoclassicsim was a beautiful trend rather than a movement. Many composers normally do not think of themselves as "neoclassicists." But some really do have some elements of the style.

Vincent d'Indy

Paul Marie Theodore Vincent d'Indy (27 March 1851–2 December 1931) was a French composer and music teacher. Born in Paris, he was encouraged to learn music by his uncle who had studied with César Franck. D'Indy later also studied with Franck at the Paris Conservatoire. He liked the music of Lizst, Beethoven and Wagner. He went to the first performance of Wagner's "Ring" at Bayreuth in 1876. He organized performances of works by Rameau and Monteverdi whose work had been mostly forgotten. He was a very conservative in his views on music, and after his proposed changes to the Conservatoire were ignored, he set up his own music school, the Schola Cantorum in 1894.

He wrote a large number of musical compositions including operas, overtures, symphonies, choral works, piano works, string sextets, string quartets, folk song arrangements, and a cello sonata. One of his well known works is the "Symphonie sur un Chant Montagnard Français" (1886) ("Symphony on a French Mountain Song"). 

He also wrote books including a biography of César Franck, and a book on how to write music.

Edgard Varèse

Edgard Victor Achille Charles Varèse, whose name was also spelled Edgar Varèse (December 22, 1883 – November 6, 1965), was a French composer who spent the greater part of his career in the United States.

Varèse's music has an emphasis on timbre and rhythm. He made up the term "organized sound." This phrase means that some timbres and rhythms can be grouped together. Although his finished works only last about three hours, he has been thought as an influence by many big composers of the late 20th century. His use of new instruments and electronic resources led to his being known as the "Father of Electronic Music" while Henry Miller described him as "The stratospheric Colossus of Sound".

Conservapedia

Conservapedia is a wiki-based online encyclopedia designed for Americans who are conservative Christians. It was created by Andrew Schlafly. Conservapedia is a reaction to what its creators see as a "liberal point of view" in Wikipedia. Conservapedia has articles on many things, but most of the site is about politics and religion. It also has lectures and other materials for students, and classes taught by Mr. Schlafly for free. All articles are written from a conservative point of view dominant in the Right-wing of the Republican Party in the United States of America. Conservapedia has some different ideas on community. They have Administrators who have the most power. Users cannot edit at nighttime in the U.S. (because of vandalism), upload images, or do other things they could do at most wikis. Users are granted these rights and can also earn the right to block other users. As of August 2018, Conservapedia owned 47,610 articles.

Conservapedia was founded by lawyer Andrew Schlafly because of what he felt was a liberal bias in Wikipedia. He did this with his homeschooled World History class after one of his students used the Common Era dating method instead of the Anno Domini method, which he liked better.

Unlike Wikipedia, anonymous people are not allowed to contribute to Conservapedia. They have to create accounts that should be using part of their real names (such as the preferred real first name and last initial setup). Edits should follow the site's conservative, Christian point of view. Administrators control every aspect of the site and have the final say in editorial authority. Vandals often edit Conservapedia to mess up the pages because they do not agree with the site's point of view. Some editors are banned for making minor mistakes.

In part of Conservapedia, editors edit the Bible to remove what they call "liberal bias" from modern versions. They claim that the New International Version of the Bible is written at the seventh-grade level and that it has politically correct language. Critics say that it is not good to rewrite the Bible and say it was bad for them to remove Jesus' prayer in Luke 23:34 and the adulteress story.

Schlafly got into an argument with Michigan State University researcher Richard Lenski over his twenty-year experiment with e.coli samples he used to show evolution happening. Schlafly mailed Lenski asking for the results. Lenski replied by showing Schlafly his paper on the subject. Schlafly (who did not read the paper) asked for the evidence and Lenski refused to hand him the samples since Schlafly is not enough of an expert. Conservapedians got in a campaign criticizing Lenski.

Critics use this as a way to show how ignorant they think Conservapedia is.

Conservapedia has had some bad reactions from people who think that it is full of statements that are untrue. It has also been criticized for supporting some ideas such as creationism.

A site called RationalWiki was created mainly to criticize Conservapedia. Some editors of that site decided that they wanted to vandalize or destroy Conservapedia. Rational-Wiki now mocks and criticizes other things too.

Two other sites, A Storehouse of Knowledge and Ameriwiki, were created as alternatives to Conservapedia.

The Bible Retranslation project has come under criticism by people who feel it is wrong to change God's word.

However, there are still some who praise Conservapedia.


Text grammar

A text grammar is the study of texts above the level of the sentence. It shows how texts are put together so as to convey ideas, facts, messages, and fiction. 

A similar term is discourse analysis. Both are mostly concerned with natural language use; discourse analysis would include spoken language. Speech is also the parent of rhetoric, the ancient study of persuasive speaking. In a similar way, literary criticism parallels text grammar, because both concentrate on the printed word. A text grammar approach puts emphasis on the linguistic structure of a text, rather than its cultural or symbolic meaning.

A text is a coherent body of sentences. Coherent means they are linked by a consistent "theme". The text ends when "completion" is signalled. For example, when a problem introduced at the start is solved, or when a promised discussion has reached a conclusion. 

Each text focuses on certain things. If texts are grouped by what they are doing, then there are five basic text types:
Many texts, of course, can and do have a mixture of two or more of these types. 

Discourse analysis

Discourse analysis is a subject which studies a text or a conversation. This is a subject in linguistics which does not study sentences, like in syntax, but the entire text or conversation. The text or conversation is known as discourse. Discourse analyst prefer to use real life discourse in their studies, rather than invented sentences like in traditional linguistics. This way of studying real life discourse is called corpus linguistics. 

Discourse analysis is related to text linguistics. However, text linguistics studies how discourse is structured so that they are connected (how sentences are joined to each other). Discourse analysis studies this, and also how the discourse is connected to the context. This context includes who the people talking or writing are, the social and cultural context. Also, it studies the way mode, which is the way the language is represented (is it a letter, speech, email, Internat chat?), influences discourse. Discourse analysis is also interested in the genre (topic) of the discourse.

Aphaenogaster kimberleyensis

Aphaenogaster kimberleyensis is a species of ant in Australia. It has been found and described by Shattuck, S. O. in 2008. It's habitat is mainly forested areas, ranging from rainforests to woodlands. They build their nests using soil mounds that are more extensive than the mounds made by most ants.

Aphaenogaster

Aphaenogaster is a genus of myrmicine ants. Almost 200 species have been described. Also, 11 fossil species are known. They live worldwide except from South America and Southern Africa. 

They are often confused with "Pheidole" or "Pheidologeton". These two have major and minor workers, while "Aphaenogaster" has only a single worker caste. "Pheidole" has a 3-segmented club on its antenna. But "Aphaenogaster" has four segments and a larger body size. "Pheidologeton" has a 11-segmented antenna, while the antenna in "Aphaenogaster" is 12-segmented.

They make very thick, easily seen nests with many big entrances in a small place. These entrances can have diameters of up to 4 cm and are up to 30 cm deep. This resulted in their common name funnel ants. These nests can be a bad problem for golfers or on pastures and unsealed airstrips, because the fragile ground easily breaks under pressure.

"Aphaenogaster" gets most of its food from tended aphids on the roots of plants. This explains that they are not commonly seen out of their tunnels. The funnel-shaped openings could play a role in trapping arthropods, which are also eaten.

Although these ants are not aggressive, they will bite when their nest is disturbed.

Schubert wrote another lied entitled "Der Wanderer;" it is numbered D.649.

The song begins with a recitative, describing the setting: mountains, a steaming valley, the roaring sea. The wanderer is strolling quietly, unhappily, and asks, sighing, the question: "where?"

The next section, consisting of 8 bars of a slow melody sung in pianissimo, describes the feelings of the wanderer: He feels that he is a stranger everywhere. This 8 bar section was later used by Schubert as theme for the second movement of the "Wanderer Fantasy".

Next the music shifts to the key of E major, the tempo increases and the time signature changes to 6/8. The wanderer asks: "where are you my beloved land?" This place the wanderer longs for is described as green with hope, "the land where my roses bloom, my friends stroll, my dead rise" and, finally, "the land which speaks my language, Oh land, where are you?" Towards the end of this section, the music gets quite animated and forms the climax of the song.

Finally, the music returns to the original minor key and slow tempo. After quoting the question "where?" from the opening, the song closes with a "ghostly breath" finally answering the question: "There where you are not, there is happiness." The song closes in the key of E major.


Erzincan

Erzincan is the capital of Erzincan Province in the eastern Anatolian region of Turkey. 
On December 27, 1939 at 01:57 UTC, the city was hit by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake, the most powerful to hit the country since the 1668 North Anatolia earthquake, which killed 32,700 people and injured more than 100,000. On the same day, the temperature was , which caused many survivors of the earthquake to die from hypothermia. The city was almost completely destroyed and it took many years to recover. It is the second-deadliest earthquake in Turkey after the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake and the deadliest earthquake in Turkey in the 20th century.

At 08:18 UTC on 13 March 1992, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake shook the city, killing 652 people and injuring more than 2,000. The city was badly damaged. 150 buildings collapsed and 8,000 buildings were damaged so badly, that they were later demolished.

Life Before Life

Life Before Life is a book written by psychiatrist Jim B. Tucker. It presents an overview of more than 40 years of reincarnation research at the University of Virginia into children's reports of past life memories. 

The book suggests that consciousness can be considered separately from the brain, which provides a basis for claims of reincarnation. "Life Before Life" has been translated into ten languages and the foreword to the book is written by Ian Stevenson. 

Ian Stevenson

Ian Stevenson, M.D., was a Canadian professor of psychiatry. He worked at the University of Virginia, in the area of parapsychology.

Stevenson thought that the idea of reincarnation might help modern medicine better understand aspects of human behavior and development. He traveled a lot over a period of 40 years to investigate 3,000 childhood cases that suggested to him the possibility of past lives. 
Stevenson saw reincarnation as the survival of the personality after death, although he never suggested a physical way a personality might survive death.

Stevenson's research was the subject of Jim B. Tucker's "Life Before Life" (2005).

Stevenson found that the best evidence supporting the belief in reincarnation comes from the cases of young children who, typically between the ages of 2 and 5, make statements about a previous life they claim to have had before being born. Their statements are often accompanied by behaviour that is unusual for their family but appropriate for the life that the child claims to remember. There is often a "forgetting of the imaged memories between the ages of 5 and 8; a high incidence of violent death claimed in the claimed previous life; and mention of the mode of death by the subject".
Some 35 per cent of the subjects have birthmarks or birth defects which often correspond to injuries or illness experienced by the deceased person who the subject remembers. Medical documents have confirmed this correspondence in more than forty cases.

Ian Stevenson authored or co-authored more than a dozen books. Stevenson died in 2007, and many of these books are mentioned in his obituaries in the "British Medical Journal", "New York Times", and the "Washington Post". 


Jhelum

Jhelum (Urdu and ) is a city on the right bank of the Jhelum River, in the district of the same name in the north of Punjab province, Pakistan. Jhelum is known for providing a large number of soldiers to the British and later to the Pakistan armed forces due to which it is also known as city of soldiers or land of martyrs.

This area is sometimes called North Panjab, Upper Panjab, Greater Pothohar/Extended Pothwar (or occasionally Hazara region), and nowadays more specifically and correctly known as Panjistan Country and when it is combined with Mirpuri, Poonchi (in Kashmir) and (Southern) Hindko localities (mostly Hazara) is also known as "Panjistani belt".

The Panjistani language (as originally formulated by Mohammad Afzal UK (1987) and some others) was formerly called North Panjabi, Mirpuri, "Poonchi", Pothwari, "Chakwali", Hindko, Pahari, "Upper Panjabi", Northern Lahnda, etc. In Jhelum it is spoken with the local accent or dialect known as Jhelumi.

These political parties namely the "Panjistan Freedom Party" (PFP) Panjistan National Party (PNP) Panjistan Communist Party (PCP) "Panjistan Republican Party" (PRP) "Panjistan Democratic Front" (PDF) Panjistan Popular Front (PPF) Panjistan Socialist Party (PSP) Panjistan Unionist party (PUP) Panjistan National Unity Party (PNUP) "Panjistan Democratic party" (PDP) Panjistan workers party (PWP) Panjistan Social Democratic Party (PSDP) and these major socio-cultural groupings called Panjistani language movement (PLM) Panjistani language board (PLB) Panjistani Literary Forum (PLF) Panjistani language Society (PLS) and Just for Panjistani Commission (JPC) want the creation of North Panjab or Panjistan province and recently formed the Charter of Panjistani council (or CPC).

Parapsychology

Parapsychology is the study of psychic events. These phenomona involve the exchange of information between a person and their environment, without the use of the five senses. They include extrasensory perception (such as telepathy), influence of mind on matter (psychokinesis), anomalous experiences (such as past life experiences and near death experiences) and apparitions. Such things have been reported for a very long time.

In 2005, Nobel Laureate Brian Josephson said that many scientists are not yet swayed by the evidence for parapsychology and the paranormal. Josephson contends that some scientists feel uncomfortable about ideas such as telepathy and that their emotions sometimes get in the way when making evaluations.The study of purported psychic phenomena and other paranormal claims, as those connected to near-death experiences, synchronicity, apparitional encounters, etc., is known as parapsychology. The majority of mainstream scientists disagree with it, calling it a pseudoscience.


Created by psychologist Michael Shermer. It states that the brain makes sense of the world by seeing patterns. Because of this the mind is constantly looking for new patterns to better understand the world. However, sometimes the mind finds patterns where none exist. This is called Paternicity or pareidolia. It is the tendency to find patterns, even when they aren’t really there. When this happens people often view the world through these false patterns.

Heuristics are ways of thinking that conserve mental effort that allow quick decisions about a large amount of information. One problem with heuristics is that they are often wrong.

Anchoring and Adjustment is a type of heuristic in which a person makes an educated guess about a question. Then, when that person learns new information they adjust their answer around their original guess. Psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman first discovered this type of heuristic. In one of their first studies on Anchoring and Adjustment they gave divided participants into two groups, gave them one of two problems and asked them to guess the answer.

These two problems were:
1 is the anchor in the first problem and 2 is the anchor in the second problem. The average guess of the group given the first problem (with 1 as the anchor) is much lower than the group given the second problem (with 2 as the anchor). The average guess of the first group was 512 and the average guess of the second group was 2,250. Even though these answers were very different both were very far from the true answer, which was 40,320.

The Availability Heuristic is used when a person answers a question based on how easily instances of an event come to mind. An example would be living in a neighborhood with a high crime rate and overestimating the amount of robberies that take place in the United States every year.



Handedness

Handedness is the preference for using either the left or the right side of the body for certain things. People are described as left-handed or right-handed when they prefer to write with their left or their right hand. They may prefer the use of certain hands for certain tasks.
Most people are right-handed. Many prefer to use their right eye, right foot and right ear if forced to make a choice between the two). The reasons for this are not fully understood. 

Ambidexterity is when a person has approximately equal skill with both hands and/or both sides of the body. True ambidexterity is very rare. In some sports work is done to even up the influence of the non-dominant side. Soccer is a good example.

Handedness is caused by the lateralisation of brain function. Lateralisation is not only found in humans: it is found in many kinds of animals.

Handedness seems to follow from the brain hemisphere division of labor. In most people the left side of the brain controls speaking, and the left cerebral hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body. In 90-92% of all humans, the left hemisphere is the language hemisphere. Therefore right-handedness predominates. This theory predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor. 

Many societies have tried to force right-handedness onto left-handed children ("forced laterality"). The general experience is that such attempts are not entirely successful, and cause distress. Writing is a good example. A right-handed script moves towards the right, and the righthanded writer's hand reveals what has just been written, which is good feedback. When a left-handed person writes a right-handed script, their hand obscures (hides) what has just been written. That interferes with the natural visual feedback to the writer. So the way our alphabet is written, moving to the right, is better for right-handed writers. 

Always there are always more right-handed people in a population. But, all the same, the world has many important scripts which are written right to left. Some, like Arabic, Hebrew, Persian and Urdu are widespread and important. It is worth remembering that in the past most people could not write. Even in England in 1800 many men signed their marriage certificate with an X, because they were illiterate (could not write). Widespread literacy came in the 19th century. So, when writing was invented, it was a few thousand years ago, and only the priests and officials needed to use it. Almost all monuments of that time used pictures as well as words, so that the mass of people could understand them. Much that we take for granted, like spaces between words (!), was not there at the start of writing, and several oriental languages can be written top-to-bottom as well as horizontally.

On the other hand, with a keyboard, handedness does not matter. This is why the issue of handedness is not so important now as it once was.

However, there are many tools which are usually made for right-handed people, and it may be difficult and more expensive to buy left-handed versions.

Physical anthropologists have pointed out that the human ability to throw weapons such as rocks and spears is quite notable. Chimpanzees have handedness, but their ability to throw is much less good. For protection, catching prey and for making tools, handedness is critical. Handedness may have been part of the mental make-up of Neanderthals, with asymmetric wear on their teeth as evidence. This would make sense, though it brings the question: "since its reason is not obvious, then why is it so widespread?". Even Darwin asked himself "Are monkeys right-handed??". In general, the answer appears to be yes.

Many other animals also have handedness. For example: elephants often have preferences for whether they swing their trunks to the left or the right. Honeybees have right antennas that are more sensitive to smells. Parrots can be left- or right-footed, and some don’t mind (they are ambidextrous). Animals as different as chickens and minnows like to look for food with one eye and look out for predators with the other. This seems to help them do two things at once.


Andromeda galaxy

The Andromeda galaxy is the nearest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way, our galaxy. Andromeda is sometimes called Messier 31, M31 or NGC 224 by astronomers. It is about 2.6 million light years away from us. In other words, we see it as it was 2.6 million years ago. The galaxy looks like a dim, fuzzy star to the naked eye. Andromeda is named after Andromeda constellation, where it is located.

Andromeda is the largest galaxy of the Local Group. The group is the Andromeda galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, the Triangulum galaxy, and about 30 other smaller clusters. Although the largest, Andromeda may not be the most massive. Recent findings suggest that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and may be the most massive in the group.

The 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that M31 contains a trillion stars (10). This is more than the number of stars in our own galaxy, which is estimated to be c. 200-400 billion.

Andromeda is estimated to be 7.1 solar masses. In comparison, a 2009 study estimated that the Milky Way and Andromeda are about equal in mass,

At an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda galaxy is notable for being one of the brightest Messier objects as seen from Earth. It is visible to the naked eye on moonless nights even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution. Although it appears "more than six times as wide as the full Moon" when photographed by a larger telescope, only the brighter central region is visible to the naked eye. Being both large and bright, it is one of the farthest objects that can be seen without a telescope or binoculars.

The Andromeda galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about 100 to 140 kilometres per second (62 to 87 mi/s), so it is one of the few blue shifted galaxies. The Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way are thus expected to collide in perhaps 4.5 billion years. The Milky Way–Andromeda collision is likely to make the galaxies merge, to form a giant elliptical galaxy. Such events do happen in galaxy groups. However, 4.5 billion years is a vast period of time, roughly equal to the time the Earth has existed as a planet.

Orbiting M31 are at least 13 dwarf galaxies. the brightest and largest is M110, which can be seen with a basic telescope. The second-brightest and closest one to M31 is M32.

The Persian astronomer Al Sufi was the first man to record seeing the Andromeda galaxy. He called the galaxy "a small cloud" in his book, the "Book of Fixed Stars", which was published in 964 AD. The first person to look at the galaxy with a telescope was Simon Marius in 1612. In 1764 Charles Messier put it into his catalogue of astronomical objects. He called it M31 and gave the credit for its discovery to Marius, as he did not know that Al Sufi had seen it hundreds of years previously.

In 1751 William Herschel estimated the distance to the Andromeda "nebula" as "no more than 2000 times the distance to Sirius," or around 17,200 light years. The best modern estimate of Andromeda's distance is 2.54 million light years. In the 1920s astronomer Edwin Hubble proved that Andromeda was a galaxy, and not a gas cloud in the Milky Way as had been thought.

Andromeda was known to the ancients, but only in the 1920s was it understood as a galaxy.

Mechanical bull

A mechanical bull, also known as a Rodeo Bull or Bucking Bronco is a machine that gives the rider sense of riding a bucking animal such as a rodeo bull or horse. 

Its speed can be made faster or slower. Padded flooring is often used around the machine in order to prevent injury to those thrown off it. 
A special motor lets the operator to safely control the ride and safety for the rider; this motor allows the operator to stop the ride before a rider is thrown off the machine. The trained operator at the speed control box controls the unit’s speed as well as spin direction. The equipment has the ability of starting rides very slowly and can be advanced to faster speeds if a rider is able to handle them. It can go slow and simply spin for beginners and run at a more advanced speed for experts or professionals.

Mechanical bulls have been around for decades as a training machine for rodeo riders, as they enable a rider to improve their rodeo performance and skills without the risk. Although mechanical bulls are still used for rodeo training, they are also used as an amusement ride, both as party entertainment and entertainment found in bars, restaurants, and clubs.

As a form of entertainment, the mechanical bull often includes a saddle (even though saddles are not used in real bull riding) and often a model of the head of a bull, complete with horns. One of the earliest uses as a form of entertainment was at Bertrand Island Amusement Park in New Jersey), where a mechanical bucking bronco ride was introduced in the 1930s, under the name of "Ride 'Em Cowboy!".

The commercial use of mechanical bulls gained popular appeal with the release of the 1980 movie "Urban Cowboy". In this movie John Travolta and Debra Winger showed the riding a mechanical bull. The mechanical bull used in this movie was the El Toro brand of mechanical bull. This brand of mechanical bull is still being made, but does not carry the same safety features that are available on more current models. Mechanical bulls can also be seen in the films "Stir Crazy", and "". In the movie "Barnyard", in the night barn, a "Mechanical Man" is seen (as the main characters are cows).

In the television show "Strangers with Candy", Jerri Blank's physical education class is uses mechanical bull riding.

A bucking bronco was originally a cowboy term for a horse that jumps about with stiff knees and an arched back.

IOS

iOS (previously named iPhone OS) is an OS for smartphones, made and sold by Apple. It is the mobile OS of the iPhone, the iPod, the iPad, Apple TV and similar devices. At first iOS was called iPhone OS, but it was renamed to iOS in 2010 to show that the operating system was being supported on new Apple devices.

iOS was released in 2005, simply known as running a version of OS X for the first generation iPhone. Apple said on January 9, 2007 at a conference that there will be a new product, the iPhone, and it would have a "revolutionary" operating system.

On March 6, 2006, Apple renamed this form of OS X to "iPhone OS" following the release of the iPhone software development kit.

On July 11, 2008, along with the release of the iPhone 3G, Apple released iPhone OS 2.0, which introduced the App Store.

In June 2009, Apple released iPhone OS 3.0, which was released along with the iPhone 3GS. It was a minor upgrade to iPhone OS 2.0 except it could do a few new things. iPhone OS 3.0 was available for the first iPhone and iPod Touch, but not all features were supported on those devices. The last version to support the first iPhone and iPod Touch was 3.1.3. It was later available for the iPad when it was released (as of version 3.2).

In September 2009, Apple renamed "iPhone OS" to "iOS". The trademark "IOS" has been used by the tech company Cisco, so Apple licensed the trademark in order to avoid conflicts.

In mid-2010, Apple also released a significant update, iOS 4.0, which added the ability of multitasking, the option to have a wallpaper for the home screen and gives the user the ability to run several apps at the same time, while the number of apps are affected by the device's RAM. Not only that, but it also had a more polished design and was the first version of iOS to be available for the iPod Touch for free. Unfortunately, the iPhone 3G and iPod Touch (2nd generation) have limited features, meaning that they can't multitask or have a wallpaper for the home screen.

In October 2011, Apple released iOS 5, which introduced many new features such as the notifications pull-down bar, a free messaging service called iMessage, iCloud, and more. A voice assistant named Siri was also released to the iPhone 4S.

iOS 6 was released on September 19, 2012 with even more features. Siri was released to the iPad (3rd generation), iPod Touch (5th generation), and the iPhone 5. YouTube was removed and a YouTube app was added to the App Store. Google Maps was also removed and replaced with Apple Maps.

On September 18, 2013, iOS 7 was released with a new look and many features, and a new feature called "Control Center" where you can control basic settings, music, AirPlay, brightness, flashlight, and more.

On June 2, 2014, Apple announced iOS 8 at their annual Worldwide Developers Conference. It has several new features, such as a new app called Health, a feature called QuickType, which predicts which words you will type, and several other features. It was officially released to everyone on September 17, 2014.

iOS 11 was announced in mid-2017. It supports the iPhone 5S and newer, the iPad Air and newer, all iPad Pro models, the fourth-generation iPad mini, and the sixth-generation iPod touch. The update removes the labels from the main Phone, Messages, Mail, and Safari icons. The App Store and iTunes store logos are replaced with a simple "A" logo and star logo with a blue and purple background, respectively. The Control Center is also easier to use, with bigger buttons and custom controls for functions like Low Power Mode and Mobile Hotspot. On the Plus models of the iPhone 6, 6S, and 7, the Lock Screen can also be rotated. In the Control Center and on the Lock Screen, when a song is playing, only the song name and artist are shown instead of also showing the album name.

iOS 11 also allows users to "offload" apps, meaning that an app can be deleted while leaving behind the app's data. It also provides suggestions and functions for saving storage space, such as deleting old messages and files. Instead of the iCloud Drive app, there is a Files app that allows users to view their files in the iPhone itself and iCloud Drive.

The only way to get the software (apps) in iOS is the App Store. The App Store is an electronic market which gives you the ability to buy "apps" (applications), small user interface applications. By January 2013, Apple confirmed to have more than 800,000 applications in the App Store.

iOS Version 7, launched Sep 18, 2013, presented a radically different tone for the iPhone, than the aesthetic which had become iconic already under vers 1 through 6: first with sharper, brighter, flatter icons; less of the photographically detailed: fewer pigments but more uncommon ones, and second with a translucent smoke glass icon tray pulldown. A third major aesthetic difference lay in the shade of blue chosen, which was brighter and especially highlighted the style of version 7 over iOS 1.0.

iOS 7.03, released Oct 23, 2013, mostly disabled the gyroscopic compass on the Apple iPod Touch, including new-at-the-time models. Later software updates further restricted compass-related hardware features, to only devices with GPS/cellular connectivity.

A "soft update" over iTunes, of Sep 9, 2014, increased the size of every user's iTunes by U2's Songs of Innocence album, which at the time could not be deleted from many users' libraries.

iOS 8, which launched Sep 12, 2014, while not as radical an aesthetic change as iOS 7 from iOS 6, being virtually required for many users.
