Phyllomedusa burmeisteri

Burmeister's frog or the common walking leaf frog ("Phyllomedusa burmeisteri") is a frog that lives in eastern Brazil. People have seen it as high as 1000 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in forests on the Atlantic side of the country. People have seen it sitting on plants near water that does not flow. The female frog leaves her eggs in nests that she makes out of leaves. The leaves are on branches high over the water. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall into the water. Scientists think this frog can live in places that human beings have changed.

Scientists think this frog is in some danger from human beings changing the places where they live to dig useful rocks out of the ground and get wood to build with.

The pre-independence government under Aung San reached the Panglong Aggrement with the Shan, Kachin, and Chin peoples on February 12,1947. Kachin State was formed in the same year out of the former British Burma civil districts of Bhamo and Myitkyina, together with the northern district of Puta-o. The state was officialy announced on 10 January 1948 and Mungdaw Masat Masat Manau for 3 days since January 9 to 11,1962.

Kachin State was bordered by India to the west, and China to the north and east. Most of the hills and all the mountains of Myanmar are in Kachin State. It lies north latitude between 23°27N to 28°25N latitude, 96°0 and 98°44 longhitude. The highest mountain of Myanmar, Hkakabo Razi, was also in the Kachin State.
The economy of Kachin State was agricultural. The main products of it was rice, teak, sucar cane, and opium, the minerals include gold and jade.

As of 2014, Kachin State population is 1,689,441.
The dominant religion of the Kachin State in northern Myanmar is Theravada Buddhism, which is practiced by 64% of the Kachin people, followed by Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Mahayana Buddhism, and Tibetan Buddhism.

Tapta

Tapta (/tap-taa/) is a fictional, imaginary and non-existing character in Meitei folklore of Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak). It is an amusing as well as scary creature described by a mother's imagination to her child, to stop his cry. Etymologically, "Tapta" is made of two words, "Tap" (sound of water drops falling on the ground) and "Ta" (literally meaning "to fall") in Meitei (Manipuri).

Once there was a child who never stopped crying.
One night, when it was raining heavily, a thief came to steal a horse from the house of the child and a tiger also came to prey on one of the horses from the same place. As the two criminals were silently waiting a right time for their chances in the dark corners of the horse-stable, they heard the mother ("father" in another version) telling her child about many scary creatures, like the elephant, the horse, the lion and the tiger coming, to pacify his crying but it was of no use to the child.
And the non-stop weeping child suddenly remained silent when the mother mentioned the name "Tapta". So, both the thief and the tiger believed that "Tapta" might surely be a dangerous creature. In the darkness, the thief started searching for the horses in the horse-stable. And as he was touching things one by one in the darkness, it coincided that he held the legs of the hiding tiger, thinking it as one of the horses in the stable. And the tiger thought that the person holding him would be none other than the so called "Tapta". And so, the ferocious tiger behaved like an obedient pet animal, fearing of the "Tapta". In the darkness of the stable, the thief prepared reins and saddles on the tiger ("false horse") and drove him away towards the woods. Again in the darkness of the woods, the tiger still believed that the person riding on and driving him was the so called "Tapta". And during the dawn, when there was abundant light, the thief recognised that the creature he had stolen was not a horse but a tiger. So, he tried to escape himself from the driving beast but the tiger never stopped running. 
The thief saw a branch of a tree on the way the tiger was running. And with intelligent and quick steps, he jumped on the branch leaving the tiger alone running. A few moments later, the tiger realised the absence of the "Tapta" (actually, the thief) from his back. So, he thought that "Tapta" might even be able to fly on the air, that was how he was gone from him. So, on his way back to home, the tiger met many other animals, including a bear, an elephant, a fox and even another tiger (variable according to different versions of the story), to whom he narrated all the incidents. All these animals did not trust him and asked him to take them to the spot where the "Tapta" had freed him. On the other hand, the thief hid himself on a "tree hole" ("tree hollow") of the same tree, on whose branch he had jumped on. As the animals led by the tiger came to the spot, the tiger told them that the very spot was nearby the tree with a hole (where the thief was hiding). So, in searching for the "Tapta", they met many unlucky circumstances, leading them to believe in what the tiger had said to be correct. For example, when the bear inserted his small tail to the tree hollow, the thief pulled it inwards with his full strength and let it go off, that the bear fell on the ground. When the elephant inserted his trunk into the tree hollow, the thief hurted it with something (probably with a stick) so hard that the elephant yelled with pain. Finally, all of these animals approached to the lion, His Highness of the forest, and narrated all the incidents. So, the lion decided to check out the matter by Himself. Meanwhile, the thief had escaped and ran away for safety. And as the lion arrived, there was no one at that place. But the other animals still believe that there is a dangerous creature called the "Tapta".


Imre Festetics

Count Imre Festetics de Tolna (17641847) was a landowner and geneticist.

Imre Festetics studued the breeding of sheep. He published some rules of heredity, and was the first to refer to these as "genetic laws of nature" ("Die genetischen Gesatze der Natur"). In so doing he used the term "genetic" for the first time, 80 years before William Bateson did. 


Festetics was hindered by the complex nature of his study traits, which were aspects of wool quality. We now know this is polygenic, that is, controlled by many genes. It does not give clear-cut "Mendelian" ratios. When Gregor Mendel turned his attention to inheritance many of the principles had already been sketched out by Festetics.

Primary production

Primary production is the synthesis of organic compounds from carbon dioxide. It occurs by photosynthesis. Light is its source of energy. It also occurs through chemosynthesis, which uses the oxidation or reduction of inorganic chemical compounds as its source of energy. 

Almost all life on Earth relies directly or indirectly on primary production. The organisms responsible for primary production are known as "primary producers" or autotrophs. They form the base of the food chain. On land, these are mainly plants; in the sea (or lakes) algae do this role. Also, there are shallow water oxygen primary producers like sea grass.

By photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, energy is used to make complex organic molecules from simpler inorganic compounds (such as carbon dioxide (CO) and water (HO). The following are simplified equations of photosynthesis (top) and (one form of) chemosynthesis (bottom):

Tropical Storm Washi was a tropical storm of the 2011 Pacific typhoon season.

On December 11, a disturbance formed and stayed near Chuuk. On December 13, the low pressure area quickly got stronger. On the same day, the JTWC upgraded the low pressure to a tropical depression. They named it "27W". The JMA also upgraded it to a tropical depression. The JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm on December 14. They then downgraded it to a tropical depression early on December 15. The PAGASA called it "Sendong" as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility. After passing Palau on December 15, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm. They named it "Washi". On December 16, Washi made landfall over Surigao del Sur, a province of the Philippines. Several hours later, Washi arrived at the Sulu Sea and regained its strength quickly. Late on December 17, Washi crossed Palawan, and arrived at the South China Sea. On December 19, Washi weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated.

In the Philippines, Washi caused at least 1,268 deaths. 1,079 people are officially listed as missing.

Officials were also investigating reports that an entire village was swept away. The flash flooding happened overnight, following 10 hours of rain. This was made worse by overflowing rivers and tributaries. In some areas, up to 20 centimeters of rain fell in 24 hours. At least 20,000 people were staying in 10 evacuation centers in Cagayan de Oro. Officials said that despite government warning, some people did not evacuate. At least 9,433 houses were destroyed while 18,616 were damaged.

Phyllomedusa sauvagii

The painted-belly leaf frog ("Phyllomedusa sauvagii") is a frog that lives in rainforests in Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. Scientists think that the chemicals this frog makes in its skin have many uses. People have seen this frog between 0 and 1000 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 69.0 to 89.2 mm long from nose to rear end, and the adult female frog is 83.4 to 96.6 mm long. It has a short nose for a frog. It has circular teeth in its jaws. Its eyes are gray. Its pupils go up and down and open side to side like a cat's. It has disks on its toes for climbing, but they are small. It does not have webbed feet. Its skin is light brown to bright green in color and wrinkled. Sometimes this frog has white stripes on its belly and jaw.

This frog does not hop. It walks. It has an opposable thumb for holding on to branches and twigs, so it moves through the trees the way a monkey or lemur does.

Because this frog lives in trees instead of on the ground, it can dry out. The frog makes wax in its skin and spreads the wax all over its body with its feet. This makes it harder for water to leave the frog's body through the skin. This way, the frog can sit in the sun to warm up and it will not dry out

Scientists are not sure what this frog eats.

The frogs build nests in trees over bodies of water. The frogs fold leaves into nests. The female lays 200 to more than 800 eggs at a time. The frogs put jelly over the eggs. This stops the eggs from drying out. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall out of the nest into the water.

This frog is not endangered but there are fewer of them than there were. This is because human beings change the places where they live, especially to dig good rocks out of the earth, because of not enough rain, because chemicals used to kill pests kill the frogs too, and because human beings catch them to sell as pets. There are no international laws against having a painted-belly leaf frog as a pet.

This frog makes a chemicals in its skin. The chemicals are toxins, or poisons. When another animal tries to eat the frog, it gets the poison in its mouth. Scientists think humans could use some of these chemicals to kill dangerous microbes. Phylloseptin-1 is one of the chemicals that the frog makes. Scientists studied Phylloseptin-1 and saw it could kill "Staphylococcus aureus" bacteria, even after the bacteria had built a biofilm to protect themselves. Another chemical, Phylloseptin-S, can kill parasites, for example "Leishmania infantum", "Leishmania braziliensis", and "Leishmania major". The chemical Sauvagine is already used in medicine because it works very much like urotensin I, which can help human hearts and help the chemicals in the human body work well.

Phyllomedusa tarsius

The brown-belly leaf frog ("Phyllomedusa tarsius") is a frog that lives in Guyana, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, and Brazil. People have seen this frog as high as 800 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is to long from nose to rear end. The adult female frog is 110 mm long. Their skin is green on the back and some of their toes are brown and white. They have white and orange bellies, white chests, and white throats. Their eyes are orange, red, and black mixed together.

This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. It lives in trees. Male frogs sit on tall plants near ponds and sing for females. The females lay 200-500 eggs at a time in nests. The nest is built out of leaves in trees hanging over the pond. The female puts jelly on the eggs so they don't dry out. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall out of the nest into the water.

Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out, even though human beings cut down its forests and allow cows to eat grass where the forest used to be. But the frog lives in such a large place and is so good at living in places that humans have changed that there are many alive now.

Variable oystercatcher

The variable oystercatcher, black oystercatcher, tōrea pango, or tōrea tai ("Haematopus unicolor") is a bird in the family Haematopodidae. It lives in New Zealand.

This bird has a long orange bill and thick pink legs. Female birds have longer bills than male birds. Its eyes are red with an orange circle.

This bird does not have subspecies, but it can come in different shades of black and white and gray. Sometimes people see young variable oystercatchers and think they are South Island pied oystercatchers, but adult variable oystercatchers are too big.

Variable oystercatchers eat molluscs, worms, and crustaceans, but they like two-shelled molluscs the most. They can put their bill inside the crack between the two shells and then twist until it opens. Sometimes red-billed gulls take the variable oystercatcher's food.

Variable oystercatchers sometimes choose one partner for their whole life. Sometimes a pair will stay in the same place where they build nests all year, and sometimes they will fly with flocks for part of the year. Both the male and female variable oystercatcher sit on the egg. The egg takes 28 days to hatch. The chick can fly after 6-7 weeks.

Human beings killed this oystercatcher for food. Its population was lowest in about 1922, when people decided to stop hunting the bird. There were 2000 birds alive in the 1970s, 4000 in the 1990s and probably 5000 to 6000 alive today.

New Zealand does not have laws protecting the variable oystercatcher. However, variable oystercatchers build nests in the same places as the fairy terns and New Zealand dotterels, which are protected.

Rape culture

In sociology, rape culture is a term that is used to describe a society where rape is common. This is mostly due to the views these societies have about gender and sexuality. Other behaviours that can often be found include victim blaming and sexual objectification. People in these societies may trivialize rape, or they say that it isn't much of a problem. They also often deny the fact that sexual violence is causing harm to the victim. Very often, there is a combination of all these issues.

The term rape culture has also been used for other settings, or to describe the behavior of specific groups of people: Examples of these are people being raped in prison, or using rape in a war, as a form of psychological warfare. 

That way, entire societies have been called rape cultures.

Some people also have sexual fantasies about raping someone, or being raped; in that context, their ideas may be seen as part of pornography. 
Second-wave feminists first had the idea of 'rape culture', in the 1970s. Most of them came from the United States. 

Critics of the concept say that it doesn't exist or is not widespread. They also say that even if there may be societies where rape is common, the concept of 'rape culture' implies that the person who rapes is not at fault; rather it is the society that made the rape possible. 

There are many movements who have addressed the idea of rape culture. They include movements such as SlutWalk and Me Too. Tatiana Burke, an American activist started Me Too, after she was sexually assaulted in 2006. Some of these movements have developed into self-help groups, where victims can talk about their experiences, and help each other.

Sexual fantasy

A sexual fantasy is a mental image, or a pattern of thought that makes the person become sexually aroused or helps this process. It can be created by the person's imagination. Sometimes, erotic literature, or pornography can help create a sexual fantasy. The same may be true for certain objects, or being attracted to another person. Anything that can produce sexual arousal can also produce a sexual fantasy.

Sexual fantasies occur in almost all societies around the world. They are rarely put into practice, mainly because of cultural, social, moral, and religious constraints. In some cases, even a discussion by a person of sexual fantasies is subject to social taboos and inhibitions. Some people find it convenient to act out fantasies through sexual roleplay. People watching porn sometimes find their fantasies validated. A fantasy may be a positive or negative experience, or even both. It may be in response to a past experience and can influence future sexual behavior

Sexual fantasy is also used for a genre of literature, film or work of art. Such works may be appreciated for their aesthetics, though many people may feel uncomfortable with such works. For example, women in prison movies may be described as sexual fantasies, as are pornographic movies. In the case of movies, the term may describe a part of the movie, such as a fantasy scene or sequence. Besides pornographic films, some mainstream films have included sexual fantasy scenes, such as "Business Is Business" (1971), "Amarcord" (1973), "American Beauty" (1999) and others.

Yenakha Paotapi

Yenakha Paotapi or Yenakha Paodabi Saijin Polibi () is an old demoness (hingchabi). Stories often show her as an evil spirit. She stays around the eaves of roofs in Meitei mythology and folklore. Her story is from Antique Kangleipak (Ancient Manipur). The stories say she interferes everywhere. Legend says that she could not live with human beings. Instead, she lives like a dog or a jackal, sitting on graves.
In some stories, she is depicted as a minor goddess (lairembi) in the Meitei religion.

The Meitei name "Yenakha Paotaapi" (ꯌꯦꯅꯈꯥ ꯄꯥꯎꯇꯥꯄꯤ) or "Yenakha Paotaabi" (ꯌꯦꯅꯈꯥ ꯄꯥꯎꯇꯥꯕꯤ) is made up of two words "Yenakha" (ye.nə.kʰa, ꯌꯦꯅꯈꯥ) and "Paotaapi" (ꯄꯥꯎꯇꯥꯄꯤ) or "Paotaabi" (ꯄꯥꯎꯇꯥꯕꯤ). In Meitei, "Yenakha" (ye.nə.kʰa, ꯌꯦꯅꯈꯥ) means "either side of the house". The word "Paotaabi" (ꯄꯥꯎꯇꯥꯕꯤ) can be fragmented into "Pao" ("ꯄꯥꯎ"), "Ta" ("ꯇꯥ") (or "Da, "ꯗꯥ"") and "Bi" ("ꯕꯤ"). "Pao" ("ꯄꯥꯎ") means , or . In Meitei, "Ta" ("ꯇꯥ") has many meanings. Its meanings may be either (1) "to " or "to ", (2) "to arrive at a stage", (3) "to " or "to ", (4) "to turn over", (5) "to " or "to ". Here, in case of "Paotaabi", ""Pao"" means "to " or "to ". "Pi" ("ꯄꯤ") or "Bi" ("ꯕꯤ") is a suffix to denote feminine gender.

There are many legends of Yenakha Paotaapi. 
Once there was a childless couple. They would play a game together. They would make riddles. Whoever lost the riddle game would give the winner a . The husband made a riddle like this: <poem>
"A man with four hands
With a rucksack by his side, 
Is dancing round and round.
Rolling around cheerful is another man in front."</poem>
The wife could not find the answer to the riddle. Then, the husband told her the answer: 
<poem>"The answer is what you do many times. You use a four spoked wheel and when you rotate it, the yarn ball rotates in the front."</poem>

Then, the wife told a new riddle to her husband:
<poem>
"What is that cries when fed and stops crying when you stop feeding?"
</poem>

The husband answered that it was a "kaptreng", a traditional Meitei traditional wooden tool for ginning cotton. The wife had to give her husband a fish on the next day. They went to sleep that night. But "Yenakha Paotabi", the old demoness, had been listening to their riddles. She thought of an evil plan to ruin the couple's life. While planning, she thought,
<poem>
"I should not lose this opportunity. 
Tomorrow, I will impersonate the wife when she is away. 
She will be driven away by her husband. I will stay with him as his wife for few days and one day, when he is asleep, I will cut his throat and drink his blood. Oh! How tasty it will be!"</poem>
The next day, Yenakha Paodabi did everything in to her plan: She changed her appearance so she looked like the wife. When the real wife was away at the market, Yenakha Paodabi entered the house holding a Shareng fish, when the actual woman was away to market. The husband had no doubt about the woman until his real wife returned home, creating a great surprise to him with the presence of two women who looked exactly like his wife.
There was a huge quarrel and then a fight between the two identical women. The husband was unable to solve the problem. So, all of them went to the King to judge their matter. After hearing the whole story, the king said to the two women, 
<poem>
"As both of you are firm on your stands, let the great God show us the truth."
</poem>
Then, as per a new plan devised by the King, a priest (maiba) got blessings from the Lainingthou (Great God) and put a hollow bamboo pipe on a banana leaf. Then, the king told the two women that only the real woman would be able to pass through the narrow bamboo pipe. The king and asked the two to try to go through the pipe to prove their real identity. But this was a trick. The demoness, not realizing, immediately transformed. She shrunk until she could fit into the hollow bamboo pipe. Then, the king immediately made his men close both the ends of the bamboo pipe. Thus, Yenakha Paodabi, was trapped. He tried to burn the bamboo pipe, but Yenakha Paodabi requested him to let her go. The king released her. From that day onwards, Yenakha Paodabi never interfered again with the couple's life.

Once there lived a widowed lady with her three children. Since her husband's death, the woman went to market and sell vegetables to feed her children. The eldest child was a girl. The girl was little grown up. So, she helped her mother in household works. The two younger children were boys. The youngest one still fed on mother's milk. One day, the mother did not return home from the market. The boys started crying. Their sister tried to console them but she failed to do so. Meanwhile, Yenakha Paotabi heard the cry. She was very happy at this. She planned to eat up all the children that very day. It had been a very long time she had not eaten any human child. So, she hid herself at that house's eaves. On the other side, the mother eloped with a man. Taking advantage of this situation, Yenakha Paotabi changed the way she looked until she looked like the mother. She pretended to be coming back from the market. She took the youngest child from the sister's hands. She held the little boy in her arms. She ate him by breaking him into pieces. The elder brother asked her what she was eating. Yenakha Paotabi answered that it was not something he could eat. She said it was Thambou (Lotus stem) brought from the market. The sister came to know that the strange woman was not their mother but a witch. So she thought of running away with her survived younger brother to save their lives. The brother and the sister ran away from the place. Yenakha Paotabi finished eating the small boy. Then, she looked for the rest of the children. She found them missing. So she started following the children. The brother and the sister hid themselves at a nearby house (""a house at far away place found after running"" in another version of the story). Later, the two siblings found their real mother. They ran towards her joyfully calling "mother". But the mother said they were not hers. She had told her new husband that she did not have any children. But he became suspicious when the children called her "mother". So he asked her if she was hiding something from him. The mother brought a Shuk (stick of rice grinder). She said that the child who could throw this Shuk in front of the front yard of the house was her true child. According to her, the one who could not do it was not her true child. The daughter (sister) mentioned God Lainingthou's name. She closed her eyes filled with tears. She threw the Shuk. The Shuk fell ahead of the front yard. The brother failed. It was because he was not strong. According to the mother's words, the sister was accepted but the little boy was rejected. The sister cried at her mother's rejection of her younger brother. The sister took out some food to feed her little brother. Her mother scolded her. After that, the sister gave her younger brother only paddy grains to cook. The younger brother brought the grains to cook them somewhere. Accidentally, he slipped on a Lukrak (Culm sheath of bamboo tree) and all the grains fell off. When he was picking up the grains, a bird known as "Waba Chengjaba" ate them all. The younger brother cried and told his sister about the accident. She gave him some more grains. Taking the grains, he came back joyfully. However, he fell again and the bird ate his food again. He got angry. At the same time, he was also scared to tell his sister he had lost the food again. So, he suffered his hunger for that day. On the next day, he told everything to his sister. She gave him some rice and three strands of hair. She taught him how to catch the bird.
The younger brother made nets from the hairs. He put some rice in front of the net. Looking at the rice, the bird came and tried to pick it up. However, the net hooked its feet. Thus, it was trapped in the net. The young boy told the bird that he would kill it. He said that he would give the bird's two legs to his sister and would take the bird's body for himself. The bird promised him a Yai (magical diamond stone) in place of its life. The Yai would give everything that he wished.
The bird took out the Yai from his mouth and gave it to the boy. The bird was set free. The brother took his sister and fled away to a deserted area. They built a palace with the help of the Yai. With the help of the Yai, they gave food and clothing to many poor people. Their mother and stepfather grew poorer day by day. They had heard of the children's fame. So, the couple approached to the children for help. They were given good food, clothing and treasures. On the way back, the mother died because of . The stepfather returned home with all the gifts. In another version of the story, the brother and the sister planned to kill both the mother and the stepfather. So the brother gave the couple two bamboo bottles filled with bees. He told them that the bamboo bottles contained drinks for them. On the way back to home, the couple fell tired of their journey. So, without looking into the bamboo bottles, they opened the bamboo bottles. They died being bitten by the bees. On the other hand, the brother and the sister lived happily ever after.

Chita is founded in 1653. After 1825, the Decembrists gave exile to Chita. George Kennan said, "Among the exiles in Chita were some of the brightest, most cultivated, most sympathetic men and women that we had met in Eastern Siberia." When Richard Maack visited Chita in 1855, he saw a wooden town, with one, also wooden, church. He estimated Chita's population at under 1,000, but predicted that the Chita would soon get fast growth in population and economy, due to the upcoming annexation of the Amur valley by Russia.

Cherepovets

Cherepovets () is a city in European Russia. It is the largest city of the Vologda Oblast of Russia, but not the capital, which is Vologda. As of 2010, the city has 312,000 people.

Cherepovets was founded by two orthodox monks Feodosy and Afanasy in November 4, 1777. In 1362, they founded the Cherepovets Resurrection Monastery, in the vicinity of which Fedosyevo was founded. Historians consider the former village of Fedosyevo to be in the center of modern Cherepovets. Several centuries were needed to develop the Fedosyevo into a prominent trade, manufacturing, and regional transportation center. Cherepovets was really founded in 1777 by Catherine the Great and became the center in the administrative structure of the Novgorod Governorate. 

The construction of the Mariinsk canal system in 1810 made a important impact on the development of Cherepovets. The Mariinsk Canal System connected Cherepovets with the Volga River to the south and the Baltic Sea to the west. At that time, Cherepovets was still at a very early stage of development with a population of 3,000 people by 1863. For a long time, the city brickworks with seven workers was the sole industrial enterprise in Cherepovets.

The development of the city changed with bringing more development, and progress after Emancipation Reform happened in 1861 and the appearance of the shipbuilding industry. Cherepovets soon became a prominent shipbuilding and logistics center connecting major regional railways and waterways. In 1915, Cherepovets' population grew to 10,000.

After the revolution of Cherepovets, in March 1918, eastern people of the Novgorod Governorate were renamed to separate Cherepovets Governorate centered around Cherepovets. The new governorate existed for less than 10 years. In 1927, it was merged with Leningrad, Novgorod, Pskov, and Murmansk Governorates into a single Leningrad Oblast. In September 1937, most of the former Cherepovets Governorate territories (except for Tikhvin district) were transferred to the newly established Russian federal subject of Vologda Oblast.

After the revolution, in March 1918, eastern uyezds of the Novgorod Governorate were renamed to separate Cherepovets Governorate centered around Cherepovets. The new governorate existed for less than 10 years. In 1927, it was merged with Leningrad, Novgorod, Pskov, and Murmansk Governorates into a single Leningrad Oblast. In September 1937, most of the former Cherepovets Governorate territories (except for Tikhvin district) were transferred to the newly established Vologda Oblast.

The subsequent development of Cherepovets is closely related to the completion of the construction of Severstal in 1955, the second-largest of Russia. Unlike the majority of the most important science centers in the Soviet Union, the location of the future steel plant was selected far away from the actual mineral resources and deposits because for that was the many people advantage of having a well-developed infrastructure that allowed connection of the north and northwest of Russia by train, road trip, and water into a single operation system. It connected such remote mining centers as Vorkuta and Olenegorsk, Murmansk Oblast.

The rapid growth of the industry center drastically changed the city, and by the early 1960s, its population exceeded 100,000 people. At 1970, Cherepovets had become the largest city in Vologda Oblast, overtaking Vologda.
Cherepovets is the largest city of the Vologda Oblast. It is 528 kilometers north of Moscow, 537 kilometers east of Saint Petersburg, 631 kilometers northwest of Nizhny Novgorod, 1,705 kilometers northwest of Yekaterinburg, and 135 kilometers slight-southwest of Vologda.

Lai Khutsangbi

Lai Khutsangbi () (/laai-khoot-shaang-bee/) is a demoness (hingchabi) in Meitei mythology and folklore. Her story is from Antique Kangleipak (Ancient Manipur). She has very long hands. The word "Lai" means "deity or divinity," "Khut" means "hand," and "Sangbi" or "Shangbi" means "long" in Manipuri (Meitei). 
The legend says that when she walks, her long hands touch the ground. Her fingers are as sharp as thorns. She has a large mouth with a long tongue. Her look is very frightening.

There was a man and woman with a little child named Shasi (or "Shachi" or "Leirik" or "Naocha" in other versions) living in a house by itself in a village. Nearby was a forest where Lai Khutsangbi lived. She usually stole and ate livestock and human babies from the village. She took advantage of people's loneliness. The people in the village were afraid.

Lai Khutsangbi wanted to eat the child Shasi. But Shasi's father, Shasipa was so brave that the Lai Khutsangbi was afraid of him. One day, Shasipa left home to work somewhere far away. He would be gone for days. Lai Khutsangbi came to the house at night, and asked Shasi's mother, Shasima if her husband was at home or not. Shasima was smart, so she lied and said her husband was at home. Lai Khutsangbi left. But she came back night after night and asked the same question again and again. Shasi's mother also gave the same reply, hiding the true fact that Shasipa was away. After some time, Shasi's father returned home and Shasi's mother told him what had happened. Shasi's father decided to defeat the demoness. That night, he waited for Lai Khutsangbi with a sharpened sword. At midnight, the demoness, as usual, came to ask Shasima if her husband was home. This time, Shasi's mother replied that he was away from home. Unaware of the trick, Lai Khutsangbi broke through the wall of the house with one of her powerful hands, trying to find Shasi, the child. Shasi's father, who was waiting for this opportunity, chopped off the hand with his sword.
Then, the demoness screamed painfully, 
<poem>
Ayo Ema, I am dead! 
Ayo yo Ema ayo yo
Leimadeng deng Ningjaobi
You a big liar
Ayo yo Ema ayoyo
</poem>
Lai Khutsangbi ran away from the house, dragging her remaining long arm. The blood flew out of her cut arm and fell onto many plants growing on her way to the forest. It is said that the red patches seen on some plants is her blood. Shasi's father followed her into the woods. The demoness could not run fast because she was injured. Shasi's father caught her and stepped on her other remaining hand. Then, he chopped off that arm too.
The villagers thanked Shasipa for his bravery. From that day onwards, Lai Khutsangbi, the long handed demoness, was never seen again.

Lee Jae-myung

Lee Jae-myung (; born 22 December 1964) is a South Korean politician and lawyer. He has been a member of the National Assembly since 2022. In August 2022, he was elected Leader of the Democratic Party.

Lee was Mayor of Seongnam, the tenth largest city in South Korea, from 2010 to 2018. He is a member of the centre-liberal Democratic Party. In 2018, he became Governor of Gyeonggi Province. He became well known during his time as governor for his response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In July 2021, Lee announced his candidacy for President of South Korea in the 2022 election. He was seen as the front-runner for the presidency, leading in many polls until late 2021. He lost the election to conservative former prosecutor Yoon Suk-yeol by a small amount of votes in March 2022.

Lee was born on 22 December 1964 in Andong, the fifth of seven children. He was raised in poverty.

As a child, he worked at a rubber factory illegally as he was not old enough to work. He hurt his finger during a work accident. In a second workplace injury, an industrial press crushed his wrist joint. The injury was untreated and caused a disability in his arm. He is registered as a disabled person.

He studied at Chung-Ang University and Gachon University. He became a lawyer after graduating. In 1991, he married Kim Hye-kyung. They have two children.

As mayor of Seongnam, he was known for creating the city's social welfare program. From 2010 to 2014, Lee announced a moratorium on payments of debt. Some criticized Lee for this and accused him of creating a political stunt. Critics said the moratorium was not needed because the city had never been forced to repay the debt immediately.

At the same time, he used the money saved to expand social welfare programs, such as offering a universal basic income for young people, free school uniforms and free postnatal care.

Lee was also known for banning dog meat and to shut down dog slaughtering facilities in Moran Market. In 2016, Lee signed an agreement with shop owners that ended the display and slaughter of live dogs at the market.

After losing his first presidential campaign, Lee ran for Governor of Gyeonggi Province. Lee became known for his response to the COVID-19 pandemic as governor. 

Lee announced a special order for all foreigners working in Gyeonggi Province to be tested for COVID-19. Seoul announced similar policies but changed them to recommendation after facing criticism.

On 7 May 2022, Lee declared his candidacy in the June 2022 elections running for a district vacant seat in Incheon for the National Assembly. Lee won the seat in the elections on 1 June 2022. Afterwards, he was elected as the leader of the Democratic Party of Korea on 28 August and became the opposition leader.

In 2023, Lee launched a 24-day hunger strike to protest President Yoon Suk Yeol's response to Japan’s release of radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power, his handling of the country’s post-pandemic economy and his strict policies on North Korea.

While he was mayor of Seongnam, Lee ran for President of South Korea in 2017 after former president Park Geun-hye was impeached on corruption allegations. In the Democratic Party's primary election, Lee placed third behind Moon Jae-in, the former party chairman, and Ahn Hee-jung, the governor of South Chungcheong Province. Lee is part of the progressive wing in the Democratic Party.

Lee declared his candidacy in the 2022 presidential election in July 2021.

Lee became the nominee of the Democratic Party of Korea on 10 October 2021. Lee won a majority of the votes in the primary and made it directly to the presidential election without a runoff.

In the general election, Lee lost to Yoon Suk Yeol of the People Power Party, 47.8% to 48.6%.

Since late 2022, Lee has been at the center of a corruption investigation. It is said that while he was mayor of Seongnam, he would receive donations from businesses and did them favors. On 10 January 2023, he went to the prosecutors office for questioning. This also marked the first time that an opposition leader was brought in for questioning regarding a criminal case, following the South Korean transition into democracy.

In February 2023, a motion for the arrest of Lee Jae-myung, which was reapproved by the prosecution, was rejected by the National Assembly, however with a large number of rebel votes within the party. 

In September 2023, Seoul prosecutors pushed for another motion to arrest Lee on corruption charges for giving special favours to a land developer in Seongnam. On 21 September, the Democratic-majority National Assembly approved the motion, with a 149-136 vote, with dozens of his own party members voting to arrest him. On that day, he was given an arrest warrant, the first time an opposition leader was arrested since the country's democratic transition. As a result, Lee went on a hunger strike in protest against the charges and President Yoon Suk Yeol, accusing him of using the criminal justice system to scare political opponents.

Lee was released after the Seoul Central District Court rejected the arrest warrant on 27 September 2023.

On 2 January 2024, Lee was stabbed in the neck during a visit to Busan. Lee suffered a "one-centimetre wound on his neck" with minor bleeding. Lee was hospitalized at Pusan National University Hospital. He was then transferred to Seoul National University Hospital with "non life-threatening" injuries. Lee had emergency surgery later in the day and was in recovery under critical condition hours later.

The Trinidad leaf frog or Trinidad leaf-nesting frog ("Phyllomedusa trinitatis") is a frog that lives in Trinidad and in mountains in Venezuela near the ocean. Scientists have seen it up in the mountains, between 280 and 1000 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in trees and moves around at night. It lives in forests both low to the sea level and high up in mountains. People have seen it in ditches and in other places that human beings have changed. People call this a "bush-dwelling frog" because people see it in bushes, but the frogs are only in these low plants when it is time to lay eggs. The rest of the year, they are high in the trees where the branches meet like a roof, where people do not see it.

Kirov, Kirov Oblast

Kirov () is a city in and the capital of Kirov Oblast in Russia. As of 2020, the city has 518,348 people. It is a historical, cultural, industrial, and scientific center of Priural'e. This city is home to the Dymkovo toys.

The native Slavic tribe of Central Russia and the Volga regions, the Vyatichis. They mixed with the Novgorodian Slovenes and Finno-Ugric people. According to the medieval chronicles, the first settlements of Russia in the area appeared in the 12th century. Kirov was first mentioned as Vyatka for the first time in 1374 when Novgorod ushkuyniks plundered it on their way to Bolghar. Vyatka was governed by a veche as other Northern Russian republics of Pskov Oblast and Novgorod Oblast. At different times in the late 14th and 15th centuries Vyatka militias raided Ustyug, Novgorod and Tatar lands on Kama and Volga. Vyatka supported Yury of Zvenigorod during the Muscovite Civil War and after his party lost the victorious Vasily II sent Muscovite armies twice against Vyatka to subjugate it and eventually it was forced to accept the suzerainty of Moscow while retaining a significant measure of autonomy. In 1469 Vyatka allied with Khan Ibrahim of the Khanate of Kazan and did not take part in the campaign of Ivan III against the khanate.

After several unsuccessful campaigns by Moscow against Vyatka in 1480s, the latter was finally annexed in 1489.

Khlynov became known throughout Russia for its clay small statues and whistles. Kirov's oldest surviving monument is the Assumption Cathedral (1689), an imposing structure inhabiated by 5 globular domes.

In 1780, Catherine the Great renamed the town Vyatka and made it the seat of Vyatka Governorate. Kirov also served as a place of exile, notably for Alexander Herzen, Alexander Vitberg, and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. By the end of the 19th century, it was an important train station on the Trans-Siberian railway.

In December 1934, Kirov was renamed after a leader of the Soviet Union, Sergey Kirov, who was assassinated on December 1, 1934. However, whilst the name Kirov has remained since the end of the Soviet Union, some institutions such as the university bear the former name of Vyatka. 
Kirov was located on the Vyatka River of the European part of Russia. It is 896 kilometers northeast of Moscow, 1,384 kilometers southeast of Saint Petersburg, 576 kilometers northeast of Nizhny Novgorod, and 851 kilometers northwest of Yekaterinburg.

James Hemings

James Hemings (1765-1801) was an enslaved man from Virginia. He is famous for being Sally Hemings' older brother and for being Thomas Jefferson's chef, or head cook, while he was in Paris. Jefferson freed him when he was 30 years old. He died at age 36. He may have killed himself.

James Hemings was the son of an enslaved woman called Elizabeth "Betty" Hemings and a white man named John Wayles. According to one of her grandchildren, Elizabeth Hemings was Wales' concubine. This means they had a sexual relationship, and she was not his wife.

According to James' nephew, Madison Hemings, Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman who might have been born in Africa. She was enslaved to the Eppes family in Virginia. Historians do not know for sure what her name was. Papers with the names of enslaved women in the Eppes family include "Dinah," "Judy," "Abbie," "Sarah," "Parthenia," and others. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed said that there were many girls named "Thenia" in the Hemings family, and they might have been named after Parthenia. But she also says that "Sally" is a nickname for "Sarah," and there were many girls named "Sarah" and "Sally" in the Hemings family too.

Madison Hemings told the story: Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman and her father was an English sea captain named Hemings. The sea captain tried to buy Elizabeth Hemings from her owner, but the owner said no. He said he wanted to see what a half-white, half-African child would look like. Then Captain Hemings tried to take the child away from the owner without paying, but someone told the owner about his plan. Captain Hemings left Virginia and did not come back.

Captain Hemings tried to take his daughter from one of the men in the Eppes family, but historians do not know which one because they do not know when Elizabeth Hemings was born. One paper says "about 1735." 

Elizabeth Hemings lived at the Eppes family's house, which was called Bermuda Hundred, until 1746. That year, Martha Eppes married John Wayles. Elizabeth and many other enslaved people went with Martha to Wayles' house as part of her marriage settlement. A marriage settlement was any property that a married woman could control and her husband couldn't. In Virginia in the 1700s, many marriage settlements had enslaved people in them. Technically, the Eppes family owned Elizabeth Hemings.

Elizabeth Hemings had 12 children. The father of most of those children, including James, was John Wayles. John Wayles also had children with his wife, Martha Eppes. This made James Hemings the half-brother of Martha Wayles Skelton, who married Thomas Jefferson.

When Martha Wayles Skelton married Jefferson, Hemings and 134 other enslaved people went with Martha Skelton to Jefferson's house at Monticello. They were part of her own marriage settlement. James Hemings was 9 years old.

The Hemings family was the largest family at Monticello. James grew up with his mother, brothers and sisters around him. Unlike other enslaved people, Hemingses did not do much farm work. The women sewed and made clothes. Jefferson hired teachers so the Hemings' boys would learn jobs to do. For example, he paid for Robert Hemings to learn to be a barber.

Historian Annette Gordon-Reed wrote that the Hemings brothers did not live the same way as other enslaved men: Jefferson spent a lot of time away from Monticello. He told his white overseers that, while he was away, they should leave the Hemingses alone. Jefferson let James and his brothers go where they wanted so long as they came back when he told them to. James was allowed to look for jobs in Virginia, choose where to work, and keep his money. There are papers showing James Hemings would rent a horse to ride from town to town. But it was Jefferson who made these choices: The law said James Hemings was a slave. It said James Hemings could only do these things because Jefferson said he could.

Jefferson was elected Governor of Virginia in 1779 during the American Revolutionary War. The capital of Virginia changed. First it was Williamsburg, Virginia and then it was Richmond, Virginia. James and his brother Robert went with Jefferson to Richmond to work for him. When Benedict Arnold led British troops to attack Richmond in 1781, James and Robert took Martha Jefferson and her daughters away from the city.

When Thomas Jefferson went to France to be ambassador, he took James Hemings with him. Because Jefferson was an ambassador, he had to have guests come to his to eat. Those meals had to be very good. Jefferson paid for James Hemings to have cooking lessons from French chefs. One of his teachers was Monsieur Combeaux. Another of his teachers was the same man who cooked for the Prince de Condé. After about 19 months, James Hemings had learned enough to lead the kitchen at Jefferson's Paris house. The house was called the Hôtel de Langeac.

Jefferson paid James Hemings 24 livres a month. Hemings spent some of his money on a tutor so he could learn to speak French very well.

After Jefferson had been in Paris for a while, he wanted his other daughter to come live in Paris too. He wrote to his relatives and told them to send this daughter to Paris from Virginia. She was named Maria, but people called her "Polly." James' sister Sally Hemings came with Polly from Virginia. Sally Hemings fourteen when she arrived in Paris and Polly was nine. Sally Hemings stayed as a paid servant at the Hôtel de Langeac. We do not know when Thomas Jefferson began having sex with Sally Hemings, but she was pregnant when she was sixteen years old.

When James Hemings lived in Paris, Jefferson paid him as if he were a free man. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed says this could be because Jefferson did not want anyone to know Hemings was an enslaved person. The laws of France in the 1770s and 1780s did not allow people to keep slaves in France. People who brought slaves to France had to either send them out of the country or free them within a certain time. Enslaved people who knew about this law could go to the admiralty court and ask the French government to say they were free. The judge at the admiralty court for Paris almost always agreed that the person was free. Gordon-Reed says James Hemings could have stayed in Paris if he had wanted to. There were about 1000 black people living in Paris at the time, and French aristocrats liked to employ them. Hemings could have worked as a chef or cook.

Gordon-Reed says that if Hemings had gone to the admiralty court, Jefferson and the United States would have looked bad in front of the French. She also says that if Jefferson had freed the Hemings brother and sister, it would have made Jefferson and the United States look good in front of the French.

However, neither of these two things happened. According to Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson's son, Madison, Sally and James Hemings talked to Jefferson. Jefferson, James Hemings and Sally Hemings made a deal in private: Jefferson promised to free all of Sally Hemings's children, whether he was their father or not. Jefferson promised to free James Hemings after he had taught more people at Monticello how to cook in the French way.

James Hemings came back to America with Jefferson. Soon, Jefferson was made Secretary of State. Again, he needed to have important people over for dinner. James Hemings was his chef. Jefferson paid Hemings the same wage as the free people who worked for him: seven dollars a month. The capital of the United States changed from New York City to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1790. The law of Pennsylvania said that if slave owners brought slaves to Pennsylvania, then those slaves were free after six months. (Enslaved people who ran away to Pennsylvania were not free, even after six months.) James Hemings was in Philidelphia for more than six months. Again, he could have gone to court and asked the judge to say he was a free man if he had wanted to. We do not know why he did not.

While Jefferson and Hemings were in Pennsylvania, Jefferson wrote a contract:

Having been at great expence in having James Hemings taught the art of cookery, desiring to befriend him, and to require from him as little in return as possible, I do hereby promise and declare, that if the said James shall go with me to Monticello in the course of the ensuing winter, when I go to reside there myself, and shall there continue until he shall have taught such person as I shall place under him for that purpose to be a good cook, this previous condition being performed, he shall be thereupon made free, and I will thereupon execute all proper instruments to make him free. Given under my hand and seal in the county of Philadelphia and state of Pennsylvania this 15th. day of September one thousand seven hundred and ninety three.

This means:

Because I paid so much money for James Hemings to learn to cook and because I want to be nice to him, I promise I will free James Hemings "if" he comes back to Virginia with me this winter and teaches someone else to be my cook. As soon as he has done this, I will make him free. I will write and sign whatever papers I need to. I am making this agreement as official as I can. We're making this agreement in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 15, 1793.

Jefferson freed James Hemings in 1796 after he had taught his brother Peter to be a chef.

James traveled. He might have gone back to Paris. If he did, he found most of his old friends were dead and the city was very different. Jefferson met him again in Philadelphia.

Jefferson won the United States presidential election of 1800. He wanted James Hemings to come and work for him and be his chef again. He asked a friend to find Hemings in Baltimore and tell him to come north. Hemings sent letters back with the friend, but Jefferson never wrote to James himself. We do not know if Hemings did not want to be President Jefferson's chef or if Jefferson only thought he did not want to. However, James Hemings did work for Jefferson again, at Monticello, in 1801. He was paid $30 for a few weeks of work.

James Hemings died in 1801. It is not clear if he killed himself. One idea was that he died from drinking too much. Gordon-Reed says that head chefs who ran kitchens, like James Hemings did, could become alcoholics. This was because chefs were allowed to drink alcohol from the house kitchens. It was also because there was a lot of pressure in the job. Other historians say that a black man, even a free black men, in the late 1700s and early 1800s had a very, very hard life.

2020 Sakhir Grand Prix

The 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix is a Grand Prix that took place at Bahrain, Sakhir 1 week after the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix.

The race was won by Sergio Pérez of Racing Point, who took his first Formula One victory and Racing Point's only win as a constructor. Esteban Ocon finished second for the Renault team to claim his first podium in Formula One, while Pérez's teammate Lance Stroll finished third, giving Racing Point their only double podium finish as a constructor. Pérez became the first Mexican Formula One driver to win a race since Pedro Rodríguez won the 1970 Belgian Grand Prix. Racing Point became the first British constructor to win a race since Lotus F1 at the 2013 Australian Grand Prix. Recovering from a first-lap spin, Pérez won having inherited the lead on lap 64 of the race after longtime race leader George Russell fell foul of a pitstop error when Mercedes brought in both of their drivers under the Safety Car which was deployed on lap 62 after Jack Aitken who was substituting for him at Williams for this weekend spun and slammed into the wall on the main straight on the previous lap lap 61 which broke his front wing off and left debris on the circuit which initially forced the Virtual Safety Car (VSC) to be deployed so that the marshals could remove the debris safely, but on the following lap after the VSC had been deployed for roughly a minute, because a convenient gap in the on-circuit traffic could not be found in order to allow the marshals to come out onto the circuit to in order to remove the debris safely the Virtual Safety Car was then upgraded to a full Safety Car in order to create a convenient gap in the on-circuit traffic to allow the marshals to remove the debris safely before he then suffered a late puncture.

With his win Perez also became the 1st ever Formula 1 driver to win a world championship grand prix after running in last place at the end of the opening lap of a world championship grand prix.

Also as the race lasted for 87 laps the event had the highest lap count of a world championship grand prix since the Australian Grand Prix in 1995 which lasted for 81 laps.

Russell drove for Mercedes at this event rather than for his usual team Williams because he substituted for World Champion Lewis Hamilton who was ruled out of the event 4 days before the event started because he was legally required to self-isolate for 7 days after he tested positive for COVID-19 just 1 day after he won the Bahrain Grand Prix on the previous day.

The race also had 1 other Safety Car deployment which lasted from lap 1 to lap 6 after Charles Leclerc collided with Sergio Pérez as he tried to pass him at turn 4 and Max Verstappen then went off and slammed into the wall as he tried to avoid the damaged Ferrari and 1 other Virtual Safety Car (VSC) deployment which lasted for 90 seconds after it was deployed on lap 54 after Nicholas Latifi suffered electrical problems and stopped his car by a access road on the straight after turn 9 and ended on lap 55.

Because of his enforced absence from this event after he tested positive for COVID-19, this was the first race without Lewis Hamilton since the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix and it was also the first race without Romain Grosjean since the 2012 Italian Grand Prix after he suffered severe burns to his hands and feet in a massive crash on the opening lap of the Bahrain Grand Prix which took place 7 days earlier when he collided with Daniil Kvyat as he tried to pass him coming out of turn 3 and he slammed heavily into the wall and the force of the impact with the armco barrier severed the barrier and tore his car in half before it then caught fire which forced the race to be red flagged for 81 minutes.

Because of his injuries which also ruled him out of the season-closing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on the following weekend Haas's reserve driver Pietro Fittipaldi substituted for him at both this event and the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix thus this meant that the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix would turn out to be his final Formula One Grand Prix before he announced his retirement from Formula 1 as he moved to compete in the IndyCar Series from 2021 onwards initially on a partial schedule for Dale Coyne Racing which excluded the oval events because of the negative memories of his massive crash at the Bahrain Grand Prix in 2020 which left him with severe burns to his hands and feet.

By substituting for the injured Grosjean at Haas for this event Pietro Fittipaldi became the fifth different member of his family to have started a world championship Formula One Grand Prix after his maternal grandfather and 2 time Formula 1 world champion Emerson Fittipaldi, his great-uncle Wilson Fittipaldi (Emerson's brother), his second cousin Christian Fittipaldi (Wilson's son) and his uncle Max Papis (Emerson's son-in-law because he is married to his youngest daughter from his first marriage Tatiana).

At this event Russell's Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas who took pole position at this event with a time of 53.377 seconds broke the record for the fastest ever pole position lap time at any world championship grand prix in Formula 1 which was previously held by Niki Lauda at the French Grand Prix in 1974 when he took pole position at that event with a time of 58.79 seconds.

Flyby (spaceflight)

When talking about spaceflight, a flyby is when a spacecraft passes close to another object, and takes some measurements, or pictures. Sometimes, the spacecraft uses the other object to gain speed or to change direction, in an operation called gravity assist.

Spacecraft that are specially designed for this task are known as flyby spacecraft. Important parameters of a flyby are the time and the distance of the closest approach.

Flyby maneuvers can be done with a planet, a natural satellite or a non-planetary object such as a small Solar System body.

Planetary flybys have occurred with Mars or Earth amongst others.

The "New Horizons" spacecraft did a fly by the Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth on New Year's Day 2019, after its successful flyby of the dwarf planet Pluto in 2015.

On the night of December 31, 2018 to the morning of January 1, 2019 New Horizons performed the most distant flyby to date, of the Kuiper belt object Arrokoth. New Horizons previously did a flyby of Pluto in July 2015, and that was at about 32.9 AU (astronomical units) from the Sun, while the New Year's Day 2019 flyby of the Kuiper object Arrokoth was at 43.6 AU.

"Cassini-Huygens" (launched 1997) orbited Saturn from 2004-2017. It performed flybys of many of Saturn's moons including Titan. "Cassini-Huygen"s had its first flyby of Titan in October 2004.

Cassini conducted many flybys at various distances of the moons of Saturn. It achieved 126 flybys of Titan, and its final close flyby was on April 22, 2017 before its retirement.

An animation of the "Cassini" spacecraft trajectory around Saturn over 10 years, during which it passed closely by many moons of Saturn, is at right.

International Cometary Explorer (ISEE-3) passed through the plasma tail of comet Giacobini-Zinner doing a flyby of the distance of of the nucleus on September 11, 1985.

In 2010, the Deep Impact spacecraft, on the EPOXI mission did a flyby of comet Hartley 2.

Flyby is also used to describe when, for example, an asteroid approaches and flies by the Earth.

This was also the term for when a comet did a flyby of Mars in 2014.

P/2016 BA14 was radar imaged at distance of from Earth in 2016, during its flyby. This enabled the size of the nucleus to be calculated to about in diameter.

On December 16, 2018 the short period comet 46P/Wirtanen had its closest approach of Earth, coming within (one of its closest approaches to Earth).

Hanuba Hanubi Paan Thaaba

The "Hanuba Hanubi Paan Thaaba" (English: Old Man and Old Woman planting Taro) or "Hanubi Hentak! Hanuba Hentak!" is a Meitei folktale originated from Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur).

Once there was a childless old couple, who used to treat a group of monkeys, from the nearby forest, kindly like their own children. One day, the old couple was planting taro plants ("paan" or "paal" in Meitei) in their kitchen garden. Seeing that, the monkeys told the two that it was actually not the right way to plant taros. They told the two that the best peeled off tubers of the taros should initially be boiled in a pot until softened and after getting cooled, these should be planted by wrapping in the banana leaves tightly. The old couple believed the monkeys and they did so as suggested. In the midnight, the monkeys relished all the cooked taros from the garden. And in place of all those delicious taros, they uprooted some inedible giant wild taros from somewhere and planted them in the garden. 
In the next morning, the old couple were surprised at the sudden growth of the taros they had planted the previous day. The two immediately prepared a dish of the recently full grown taros and ate them. But as soon as they gulped some, both felt a tingling sensation in their throat. Unable to bear the allergy, both asked to give "hentak" (a traditional edible paste made from fish meat and some vegetables) to each other. It was only after they had the hentak that their allergy was cured. Realising that the monkeys had tricked them, the two devised a plan for revenge. And according to the plan, the old man ("hanuba" in Meitei) pretended to be dead, and the old woman ("hanubi" in Meitei) cried out loudly to make the monkeys hear her cry. Then, the monkeys came there and asked the old woman what had happened. She told them that the old man died after eating the taros. She asked them to help her taking the old man's body out in the lawn. All the monkeys, unaware of the plan, came inside the house. As soon as they came near the old man, he took up his stick and started beating them. Frightened, they all ran away. The old couple knew that the monkeys would surely come back. So, they climbed up on the attic and hid there. When the monkeys arrived, the attic broke and felt upon them. Thus, they fled the spot. Fearing that they might come back again, the old couple hid inside a large pot. When the monkeys came back, the old man started to fart slowly. Then, the old woman also farted but she did in an uncontrollable way that the pot banged on. The banging sound was too loud that the monkeys fled the spot and never came back.

"Hanubi Hentak", an animation feature film, based on the folktale, was produced by the PUPU FOLKs TV in 2017.

"Paan Thaaba" ("Planting Taro"), a play directed by Dr. Usham Rojio, based on the folktale, was premiered in MDU on 15th of August, 2018.

Edgar de Wahl

Edgar Alexei Robert von Wahl or de Wahl (23 August 1867 – 9 March 1948) was a Baltic German teacher, mathematician and linguist. He is most famous for being the creator of Interlingue (known as Occidental throughout his life), a naturalistic constructed language based on the Indo-European languages, which was initially published in 1922.

Edgar de Wahl was born in Kherson and spent his early childhood in Ukraine. Later, he moved with his family to Tallinn and then to Saint Petersburg, where he studied and served in the Imperial Russian Navy. After that, he worked as a teacher in Tallinn from 1894. When his home in Tallinn was bombed in 1943, he was imprisoned by Nazi troops. He refused to adhere to Heim ins Reich and was released in 1944 after his friends requested his transfer to a hospital due to his mental health issues. He died in a psychiatric hospital in 1948.

De Wahl was first introduced to interlinguistics through Volapük, which his father's colleague Waldemar Rosenberger introduced him to. He composed a lexicon of marine terminology for the language before turning to Esperanto in 1888. He supported Esperanto and influenced the early work on its grammar and vocabulary along with the ophthalmologist L.L. Zamenhof. After the failure of Reformed Esperanto, which he supported, he started creating his ideal form of an international language. In 1922, de Wahl published a "key" to a new language, Occidental, and the first edition of the periodical Kosmoglott (later Cosmoglotta). He developed the language over several decades with input from its speakers but became estranged from the movement centered in Switzerland from 1939 after the start of World War II. Later, he joined the Committee of Linguistic Advisors, part of the International Auxiliary Language Association, which presented Interlingua in 1951.

Edgar de Wahl was a member of the Päinurme line of the Wahl noble family. Edgar de Wahl's great-grandfather was Carl Gustav von Wahl, who bought the Pajusi, Tapiku and Kavastu manors and was also the owner of Kaave Manor for a short time. Carl Gustav von Wahl had a total of 14 children from two marriages, from whom different Wahl lines started. Of them, Edgar von Wahl's grandfather Alexei von Wahl, a civil servant who bought Päinurme manor in 1837, laid the foundation for the Päinurme line. Also, he was a tenant at Taevere Manor, where Edgar's father Oskar von Wahl was born.

Edgar Alexei Robert (born von Wahl) was born on August 23, 1867 to Oskar von Wahl and Lydia Amalie Marie (married 1866 in Tallinn), in what is now Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv Oblast in Ukraine (then in the Kherson Governorate, Russian Empire). The Wahl family had moved to Ukraine after his, a railway engineer, started work on the Odesa-Balta-Kremenchuk-Kharkov railway in 1866. By 1869, the Wahl family had moved to Kremenchuk, where de Wahl's brother Arthur Johann Oskar was born in 1870. After that, the family moved to Tallinn, where Wahl's two sisters were born - Lydia Jenny Cornelia in 1871 and Harriet Marie Jenny in 1873. The family later moved to Saint Petersburg where the third sister Jenny Theophile was born in 1877.

During his boyhood, de Wahl learnt several languages; he became fluent in German, Russian, Estonian and French. In upper secondary school he studied Latin and ancient Greek, and Spanish at university. In addition to these, throughout his life he was able to make himself understood in nine other languages. de Wahl had an interest in creating languages from a young age:
Even in my youth, I had the idea of constructing a language. Full of stories from Cooper, Gustave Aimard etc, I played American Indians with my friends, and conceived the idea of a special quasi-Indian jargon for our games. It was made of indian words taken from stories, and completed with other necessary words taken from diverse other languages. It had a grammar composed of mixed Ancient Greek and Estonian. This language was never used because my friends refused to learn it.

In 1892 de Wahl volunteered to serve in the Russian Navy. During his service, he travelled a lot, visiting the Caribbean islands and the United States among other places. In early 1894, he received the rank of Michman (Russian: мичман) and retired shortly after that.[8] In the summer of 1904, de Wahl was again called to active service. He served in the Baltic Fleet until October 1905, although he did not participate in the battles of the Russo-Japanese War.

According to the life stories of Estonian artist Olev Mikiver [et; sv], who knew de Wahl as a youth, de Wahl had been very proud of his Tsarist-era officer's uniform and sometimes even wore it later:

It is, however, unlikely that de Wahl participated in the stopping the Sveaborg rebellion, having already been released from service by then. He may have been called to active service during the First World War.

During his service in the Russian Navy, de Wahl was awarded the 2nd and 3rd rank of the Order of Saint Stanislav and the 3rd rank of the Order of Saint Anne. After getting the Estonian citizenship at the end of 1920 de Wahl was from 1921 also registered as a reserve officer of the Republic of Estonia.

In 1894, de Wahl moved to Tallinn, where he spent most of the rest of his life. That autumn, he started working as a teacher of mathematics and physics at St. Peter's High School of Science (now the Tallinn Secondary School of Science). Later he taught drawing at run by Baronness Elisabeth von der Howen, the , and the Tallinn Cathedral School. His teaching was interrupted only by his military service.

De Wahl's teaching style was described in the memoirs of the later Estonian Minister of Education Aleksander Veiderma, who himself studied at St Peter's High School of Science from 1906 to 1909:

English translation:

Mathematics and physics were also taught by Edgar von Wahl, a former naval officer who always had some interesting statements about an event or person. He was very messy in conducting physics experiments: utensils or glass often broke. His attitude towards students was simple, which is also proven true by the nickname Sass.

–Memoirs of Aleksander Veiderma

At the turn of the century, de Wahl's began to publish articles on linguistics in specialized publications, as well as writing in various Tallinn newspapers and magazines. Since 1898, de Wahl had been a member of the "Estonian Literature Society" (German: "Ehstländische Literärische Gesellschaft"), a German-language association that regularly organised presentations by and for its members. Under the pseudonym Julian Prorók, he published a booklet "Ketzereien: Keimzellen einer Philosophie" ("Heresies: Gametes of a Philosophy") in 1906 about his vision of global developments.

De Wahl also entered politics before the outbreak of World War I. In 1913 he was elected to the Tallinn city council, and became a member of the council committee for the protection of monuments of ancient buildings. Despite his teaching position, de Wahl did not address education issues on the City Council. He was an active attendee at council meetings, but spoke little.

After the start of World War I, the Germans living in the Russian Empire were subjected to repression, from which did not completely escape; the , of which de Wahl had been a member, was closed. In autumn 1914, he found himself at the centre of a propaganda campaign to change German place names. As a city councillor, he participated in discussions on the renaming of the city of Tallinn, following Mayor Jaan Poska's proposal replace its name with the Old Russian-language "Kolyvan" (in the discussion of the matter, the incorrect name "Kalyvan" was used). discovered that the oldest names of the city were "Ledenets" or "Lindanisa". He was interested in how much it would cost to change the name, which was said to have been met with "general laughter" at the council. The votes required to change the name were eventually reached by the council, but the change itself did not take place.

De Wahl was elected to the city council held just before the February Revolution in 1917. On the new council, he became a member of the city's fire department, public education, and pawnshop affairs committees, and continued as a member of the committee for the protection of monuments of ancient buildings. However, in August 1917, a new council was elected, and 's political activities ceased.

In February 1918, at the time of the Estonian Declaration of Independence, expressed a desire to join the voluntary militia Omakaitse. As a student who wrote weapon permits for volunteers: "Among those who wanted to make weapons, I only remember one: my physics teacher, von Wahl. I think I remember it because of the mood that might have arisen in the soul of a young student when his teacher asks him for a weapon."

In 1919, the Secondary School of Science was divided by language: the Tallinn High School of Science taught in Estonian and the Tallinn German High School of Science taught in German. continued as a professor at the latter, where he taught classes in mathematics, physics, geography, cosmography, and drawing. He had a house on Eha Street, not far from the school, where students often went for follow-up work. He had designed this house in a marine style and it was therefore nicknamed the "cabin" by his students. Among his students, was a popular teacher who was particularly dedicated to teaching geography since he had travelled extensively. The students were impressed by the fact that was a member of the English Club, which operated at the school.

De Wahl sometimes clashed with his colleagues, openly expressing his distaste for modern art, for instance comparing it to communism when invited to an art exhibition by the school's art teacher. retired in the mid-1920s, but continued to teach part-time until 1933. He then took up his hobbies, especially artificial languages, which had become a passion since the days of St. Petersburg. Additionally, he was editor of the magazine "" from 1929 to 1930.

Unlike his relatives, did not leave to be in 1939, deciding to stay in Estonia. , who represented the idealistic pan-European idea, did not like the National Socialist government of Germany, calling it a "termite state." Wahl may also have chosen to stay to avoid abandoning his large archive. The danger of ending up in a retirement home in Germany might also have played a role: this had happened to several of his acquaintances. De Wahl again avoided the to Germany that took place in the winter and early spring of 1941. He was certainly aware of the opportunity to leave, for when asked about his plans by one of his former students, he replied, leaving no doubt that his decision was stay in Estonia:

In the first year of Soviet repression, managed to escape, although some of his relatives were arrested. After the beginning of the German occupation of Estonia, he was suspected of anti-state activities. was arrested on August 12, 1943, because of letters sent to Posen, to his wife's sister-in-law, that were caught by the censors in Königsberg in July of that year. In these letters, he had predicted the outbreak of an uprising in Poland and advised the family who lived there to go to Germany:

In the same letter, noted that he had previously predicted the attack on Pearl Harbor and the later outbreak of war between the United States and Japan. During the interrogation did not deny what he had written, and repeated several of the accusations he had made, "firmly believing" in the veracity of his predictions. was held for some time in the Tallinn Labour and Education Camp, but the testimony given during his interrogation was considered strange by the "Sicherheitsdienst", and so was sent to be examined at the . There he was diagnosed with dementia caused by ageing and he was left in the Seewald hospital, which also saved him from a possible death penalty. was defended by several close relatives and friends who claimed that he was not responsible for his actions.

During the bombing raid in March 1944, 's house including his archive collection was destroyed, which came as a great shock to him. Three years later, in a letter to the Finnish Occidentalist , he recalled that what had happened was a real disaster, during which many irreplaceable and unique materials were lost.

In August 1945 of the Germans still living in Estonia by the NKVD took place. The list of people to be deported included 's name. At the time of the deportation, however, was among a dozen people who were not deported or whose whereabouts could not be determined. Although the reasons for 's escape are not known, in some cases the head of the task force that carried out the deportation made the decision not to take the seriously ill or disabled, so the decision may have been influenced by the opinion of the hospital staff. Therefore, it was his presence in a mental hospital that saved de Wahl for a second time.

During and after the war, his foreign colleagues had very little information about de Wahl's condition and location; only in the spring of 1946, the Finnish Occidentalist A. Z. Ramstedt was able to restore contact with de Wahl. It is unclear why the hospital staff at Seewald enabled such correspondence; perhaps that they may have recognized his dedication to linguistics when being supportive to his communication with the outside world.

De Wahl died on March 9, 1948. He was buried on March 14 at the Alexander Nevsky Cemetery in Siselinna Cemetery, Tallinn. In 1996, his remains were moved to the , the family cemetery of the family.

Phyllomedusa chaparroi

Phyllomedusa chaparroi is a frog that lives in Peru. Scientists have only seen it in two places. People have seen this frog between 537 and 650 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is about 67.9 to 77.5 mm long from nose to rear end. This frog looks like "Phyllomedusa camba". Scientists looked at the frogs' mitochondrial DNA to tell the two species apart. 

The iris of the eye is red-brown in color with tiny orange spots.

This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and forests that are growing back. People saw this frog at night near ponds that dry up for part of the year. They were on plants .5-1.5 meters above the ground. The female frog lays her eggs in a nest that she makes out of foam. She makes the nest on a leaf hanging over the water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water.

Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large space.

Bala shark

The bala shark, "Balantiocheilos melanopterus", also known as the tricolor shark, tricolor sharkminnow, silver shark, or shark minnow, is a fish of the family Cyprinidae, and is one of the two species in the genus "Balantiocheilos".

The bala shark is found in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo. Some people say they have seen it further north in the Mekong and Chao Phraya River, but this is due to confusion with the recently described and possibly extinct "B. ambusticauda" (although the presence of any "Balantiocheilos" in the Mekong is not known). Bala sharks are found in midwater depths in large and medium-sized rivers and lakes. They feed on phytoplankton, but mostly on small crustaceans, rotifers, and insects and their larvae. Bala sharks are misunderstood aquarium fish. They are generally peaceful and good to many other types of tropical fish. Bala sharks are in some pet stores, but may grow too large for an aquarium.

These fish have a silver body with black ends on their dorsal, caudal, anal, and pelvic fins. They have big eyes to find and catch their prey. The bala shark will grow to a maximum length of .

V(D)J recombination

V(D)J is the basis of the vertebrate immune system. It makes antibodies.

All vertebrates have an adaptive immune system. This protects them against many infections and diseases caused by viruses and bacteria. V(D)J is the basic mechanism. The work is done by developing lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). They make the immune system adaptive. What this means is that the body is able to defend against many infections it has never met before, and the defence gets better against repeat attacks from the same agent. 

The details are very complex. The system makes sequences of amino acids which bind on to the corresponding sequences of infective agents. The system also recognises "altered self cells" as seen in cancer.
Of course all systems have limits, so when the system fails to recognise a pathogen or cancer, we suffer the consequences.

In 1987 Susumu Tonegawa was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for his discovery of the genetic principle for generation of antibody diversity".

The V(D)J refers to the way variable, joining and sometimes diversity regions are produced in the white blood cells. The cells are made in the bone marrow and thymus of vertebrates.

Phyllomedusa distincta

The Sao Paulo leaf frog ("Phyllomedusa distincta") is a frog that lives in Brazil. People have seen it as high as 1000 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in forests that have never been cut down and in forests that have grown back. People have seen it on shrubs near water that does not flow. The female frog lays eggs on leaves that are over water that does not dry up. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water below.

Scientists do not believe that this frog is in danger of dying out. This is because it lives in such a large place. But there are fewer of this frog than there were. This is because human beings change the places where the frogs live to build towns and cities, make small farms, make tree farms, and get wood to build with.

Mute R. Kelly

Mute R. Kelly (also styled as #MuteRKelly) is an American movement. It wants contemporary R&B, soul and gospel singer and recording artist R. Kelly convicted (meaning found guilty) of sexual abuse, child pornography, kidnapping and obstruction of justice. The movement also wants Kelly to stop receiving money with his singing career.

The movement was founded by Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye in 2017. The latter said: "#MuteRKelly continues until the Black community has fully financially divested from the man and his music and we tackle the overwhelming issue of sexual abuse". Odeleye was an African American Arts Administrator from Atlanta, Georgia. Barnes is a lobbyist and activist. She also sought to lobby elected officials. She wanted to mobilize activists around the world to encourage users of music streaming platforms to #ThumbItDown, when R. Kelly's music plays. This was in order to change the algorithm of his songs until they are no longer playing.

During a period of two to three decades, Kelly was accused of sexual abuse of children and adolescents. One example was getting married to then fifteen-year-old R&B and pop singer Aaliyah on August 31, 1994 in Cook County, Illinois. The marriage was dissolved just over five months later at orders from from Aaliyah's family. Aaliyah later admitted she had lied to people about her age. She was really fifteen-years-old when she and Kelly married each other.


Black-winged stilt

The black-winged stilt or pied stilt ("Himantopus himantopus") is a bird in the family Recurvirostridae. It lives in many places in the world: Australia, South America, Central America, Africa, southern Asia, some of North America, some of Europe, the Philippines, New Zealand, New Guinea, Indonesia, and the Solomon Islands.

This bird has black and white feathers. Its legs are long and orange. Its bill is straight and black. The irises of its eyes are red. They have gray feathers on their heads. The gray part gets bigger as the bird gets older.

This bird lives in mudflats, marshes, and the shores of lakes and rivers.

This bird wades. It walks through shallow water on its long legs. It uses its beak to catch small animals with no spines off the top of the water. It can swim and put its head under the water to catch food, but it does not do this often. It eats insects, mollusks, and crustaceans. It can look for food in large flocks, groups of birds. The birds in the flock do not all have to be black-winged stilts. The black-winged stilt will look for food with banded stilts and red-necked avocets too.

Many pairs of black-winged stilts build nests near each other. This is called a colony. But each pair will fight other birds if they come too close to their nest. The birds either dig a small hole in the ground or put pieces of plants on the ground to make the nest. Both the male and female stilt sit on the eggs.

Magan (civilization)

Magan (also Makkan) was an ancient nation. It is mentioned in Sumerian cuneiform texts of around 2300 BC. It lasted to 550 BC as a source of copper and diorite for Mesopotamia.

Historians were not always sure where Magan was. Some historians thought Magan could be in part of Yemen called Ma'in in the south of Upper Egypt, in Nubia or the Sudan, and others as part of today's Iran or Pakistan.

With the disappearance of trade from the Indus region, the copper from Magan was later replaced by copper imports from ancient Cyprus.

The earliest Sumerian text that talks about Magan (Sumerian 𒈣𒃶 "Magan", Akkadian "Makkan") was written during the Umm al-Nar period (2600–2000 BCE). It also says "the Lords of Magan." Sumerian texts also talk about "Tilmun," which historians think was in what is Bahrain today, and about "Meluhha," which could be the Indus Valley. The Akkadians fought the Magans in the twenty-third century BCE. This could be why the people built forts. For example, the writers Naram-Sin and Manishtusu, wrote of fighting wars against "32 lords of Magan."

Gudea talks about the devotions to his Temple: "Magan and Meluhha will come down from their mountains to attend." The words Magan (𒈣𒃶) and Meluhha (𒈨𒈛𒄩) appear vertically in the first column on the right.

Naram-Sin gave the Akkadian title "Malek" to the defeated Ruler of Magan, a title which survives in the Arabic for king, "malek".

The Magans built good ships and could sail well for the time. King Sargon of Agade (2371–2316 BCE) wrote that ships Tilmun, Magan, and Meluhha came to his ports. His successor, Naram-Sin, conquered Magan but he honored the Magan King Manium by naming the city of Manium-Ki in Mesopotamia after him. Trade between the Indus Valley and Sumer went through Magan. However, that trade might have stopped at one time. Ur-Nammu (2113–2096 BCE) said he had "brought back the ships of Magan."

Archaeological finds from this time show trade not only with the Indus Valley and Sumer but also with Iran and Bactria. They might also show the earliest case of the disease poliomyelitis in the skeleton of a woman from Tell Abraq. The skeleton was found in modern Umm Al Quwain.

Trade was common between Magan and Ur before the reigns of the Gutian kings over Ur. After they were deposed, Ur-Nammu of Ur restored the roads and trade resumed between the two nations (c. 2100 BC).

Magan Civilization and Magan territory has also been mentioned in the fantasy book, MAGA - The Untold Legend (ISBN: 978-1777903404) and has a very close relationship with the Mayan Civilization, two mother civilizations of ancient world on earth established by MAGA and MAYA, respectively.

Most of the frogs scientists have seen were in forests that had been cut down and grown back with many streams and dense undergrowth: There were many bushes and other small plants under the trees. Scientists have seen the female frog lay eggs in a folded leaf hanging over the water. 

Scientists do not think this frog is in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place.

Medusa with the Head of Perseus

Medusa with the Head of Perseus is a sculpture. Argentine artist Luciano Garbati made it in 2008. It is famous because people in the Me Too movement talked about it. The media called the statue an "icon of justice" for people who survived sexual assault. That happened several years after the statue was made.

Medusa is a Greek myth. In the story, Perseus kills Medusa, not the other way around: Medusa is a monster with a face so terrible that anyone who sees her turns to stone. Medusa lives on an island. The hero Perseus comes to the island to kill Medusa. He cuts off her head and puts it in a bag. He later uses the head to turn his enemies to stone. Perseus then gives Medusa's dead head to the gods. Zeus puts Medusa's head on his shield so it will frighten his enemies.

At some point in history, no later than the Roman poet Ovid, another part was added to the myth: Medusa starts as a human priestess and not a monster. She works for the goddess Athena in her temple. She is raped by the god Poseidon in Athena's temple. To the people telling the myth, Medusa, not Poseidon, was the one who had done something bad. Athena punishes Medusa by turning her into an ugly monster: Her hair turns into snakes. Her face becomes terrifying. Only then does Medusa go to the island where Perseus will later kill her.

In the 1500s, Benvenuto Cellini made a sculpture called "Perseus with the Head of Medusa". In that sculpture, a nearly naked Perseus holds up Medusa's head. Garbati wanted to make that statue in reverse. Garbati did not think he was making feminist art. He only want to "flip the script" of the story of Perseus and Medusa. He only wanted to show the sculpture the opposite way.

Garbati started with clay. He used the clay model to make another sculpture out of resin and fiberglass. Then, he could use the resin sculpture to make copies out of bronze. The sculpture is almost 7 feet tall (about 2 meters). It shows a naked Medusa with a sword in her left hand. She holds a man's head by the hair in her right hand. She stares down and ahead. She looks like a woman and not a monster. Garbati used his own face for Perseus.

Garbati offered to sell the original resin sculpture for US$35,000 and bronze copies for US$60,000, depending on who made the bronze copy.

Garbati decided not to copy Cellini's statue exactly. Cellini shows Perseus holding Medusa's head high and smiling. He stands lightly on one foot. Garbati shows Medusa holding Perseus' head low and staring straight ahead. She stands heavily on both feet. Garbati said this was because Perseus coming to attack Medusa meant different things to Perseus and Medusa:

"I was thinking of Perseus, this man with all his gadgets, going there and having this victory. This difference between a masculine victory and a feminine one, that was central to my work. The representations of Perseus, he's always showing the fact that he won, showing the head…if you look at my Medusas…she is determined, she had to do what she did because she was defending herself. It’s quite a tragic moment."

During the #MeToo Movement, thousands of women wrote to Garbati saying what the statue meant to them. They said Medusa was a woman who had been raped who fought back.

Some people said that black women started the #MeToo Movement, so it was not good to have a statue made by a male artist as its symbol. Garbati answered that he liked that people liked his statue. He also said he'd learned more about patriarchy. Other people asked Garbati why he made Medusa naked and beautiful when she is ugly in the myth. He answered that artists have been showing Medusa as beautiful since the 400s b.c.e. Other people asked why Medusa was holding the head of Perseus and not of the god who raped her, Poseidon. This was because Garbati had not meant to make the statue about rape survivors. He had only meant to do Cellini's statue backwards.

For a long time, the statue stayed in Garbati's own art studio in Buenos Aires.

In 2020, the statue was shown in New York's Collect Pond Park near the court of criminal justice. This was where Harvey Weinstein stood trial for his crimes. Garbati and helpers started selling small copies of the statue. They gave 10% of the money to the National Women's Law Center.


Zhiar Ali

Zhiar Ali is a Kurdish person from Iraq who is a human rights activist, animal rights activist and journalist based in Sulaymaniyah. He is known for his work for LGBT rights in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Ali was the former media and communications officer at Rasan, he later founded Yeksani, a movement advocating for LGBT rights in the Iraqi Kurdistan. He had also co-founded the first pro-vegan animal rights organization Kurdistan Vegans. He has freelanced for news organizations, focusing on music journalism and political and social issues.

Ali was attacked by the media in a campaign, the campaign was bigger and was against the LGBT community in 2020. After these attacks, he was threatened with murder and assault. The attacks started happening more after Ali did a Global Pride speech on June 27, 2020, organized by InterPride.

He criticized Asayish and the Kurdistan Regional Government for an operation which detained LGBT people in Sulaymaniyah. The campaign took place after Asaiysh (local security forces) thought all gay people are sex workers, Ali tried talk about this mistake in a "Middle East Eye" interview. Denying that all members of the LGBT community in the Kurdistan region were sex workers, he blamed the government for forcing some into sex work and said that "prostitution is the last choice to earn a living".

Ali is the youngest of five brothers and sisters. He said in a makanati.net interview that he came out to his mother and older sister in 2017 when he founded Lava Foundation, an unregistered organization working on raising awareness of LGBT issues.
Like the vast majority of society, my family approached [sexuality] close-mindedly without having any information, they would insult [those who were gay]. When I would spend time with them, sometimes, they would engage in aggressive conversations and hurl insults towards LGBT people. [...] I would leave the room silently because I felt like those insults were directed at me. [...] I tried repeatedly to change and undergo a "curative treatment" to no avail. I got to the conclusion that this is me, accepted myself, and moved on. – Ali, on his experiences with his family and sexuality.
In an interview with Queer Film Festival Utrecht, Ali talked about his relationship with his family, reporting that he was disowned and kicked out of the family house when he came out publicly, and receieved death threats from his brother.

Ali has a plant-based lifestyle and co-founded in 2018, one of Iraq's first vegan organizations which focused on environmentalism as well as raising awareness about "a healthy lifestyle" at the same time as raising awareness about a vegan lifestyle. A vegan for five years, he had discussed the difficulties of the lifestyle in Iraq; vegan products are scarce, difficult to find, and often overpriced. During an interview, he claimed that before their work at Kurdistan Vegans, there were no dedicated vegan restaurants, but after their advocasy, one was announced in his region.

Ali began his activism in 2017 with Lava Foundation which did not last for a long time, and was hired by Rasan in late 2019; Lava Foundation activities were then carried out in Rasan. After more than a year with Rasan, Ali left the organization and founded Yeksani. Ali's activism focuses on raising awareness of regional LGBT community issues, letting the public know about the community's needs and wants and international actors to encourage action, and normalizing the community in Kurdish society. He emphasizes that LGBT+ living conditions in Kurdistan are poor due to a lack of public awareness.
Gay people should be protected by law and not discriminated against, [homosexuality] is a natural human desire, not an illness. Every workplace should be legally forced to be inclusive to LGBT people in job oppertunities, and even the local security forces need to treat them better. – Ali to Kurdish news outlet Peregraf in an interview.
Ali mostly uses social media for his activism. He regularly raises awareness about the legal laws used to put LGBT people in jail, and said in a BBC Persian interview that Articles 393, 394, 400, and 401 of Iraqi law are used to illegally detain LGBT people. Ali was also an animal rights activist and a former project manager of Kurdistan Vegans, where he arranged and coordinated World Vegan Day events for two years in a row.

He was a journalist with Spee Media, a local independent news outlet. He was focusing there on music journalism, and most of his work featured Wild Fire. He also wrote about conflict in the Middle East, LGBT+ rights in Iraq, and social and civic issues.

On May 17, 2020, the European Union (EU), British, and Canadian embassies raised the pride flag in their Baghdad headquarters, which caused a massive backlash, forcing the EU embassy to take down the flag after a few hours. This caused a hate campaign against the LGBT community of Iraq which was supported by visible Iraqi politicians. Ali wrote an extensive report about the progression and worsening situation of LGBT people in Iraq which was hosted on Rasan's website, reporting murder of people precieved to be gay, as well as messages of hate broadcast on national TV. The report was later used for assessments and further studies regarding LGBT rights in the region.

During an interview, Ali discussed the difficulties with being part of the LGBT+ community and finding housing, reporting that many LGBT youth are denied rent or properties are not sold to them, so they are forced to get married to the opposite gender only to have a place to live in. He also talked about how the Directorate of Non-Governmental Organizations have made it impossible to register LGBT organizations in the region.

On April 1, 2021, news said that Asayish set checkpoints around Sulaymaniyah and detained some people they thought were gay. Although a lot of people expressed anger on social media at the operation, seventeen members of Sulaimaniyah's Provincial Council signed a petition supporting the arrests. Ali led Take Action, an online campaign through Yeksani which received broad global support, and helped bring the issue to the attention of Amnesty International, the US Consulate in Erbil, Human Rights Watch, ILGA Asia, and other international, national, and local groups. The decision to conduct the operation was influenced by conservative groups in the region, especially the Kurdistan Justice Group.

According to Ali, 15 individuals (some underage) were apprehended by the operation and security checkpoints were set up in places thought to be popular with LGBT people. He said that Asaiysh did not differentiate between LGBT sex workers and other community members or later focused their operation on prostitution to avoid international backlash. Ali highlighted security forces' "tests" on suspects to determine if they had sexual contact before their arrests, calling the tests criminal and humiliating. He told "Middle East Eye" that "even if people resorted to sex working, it's the government's fault since it's their last choice of livelihood."

Ali repeatedly told the media that community lives were in danger, and he was afraid to be caught at one of the checkpoints since he is openly gay. After local and international pressure from civil-rights organizations and activists, Asayish stopped the operation, released the detainees, and published a statement that they were investigating reports of prostitution in the region and did not "target any specific groups of society."

Due to discrimination, followed by the operation, Ali reported that many LGBT people (including himself) felt excluded from Kurdish society. Many others also called the operation dehumanizing and criminal. Ali critisized other NGOs that claim to work on LGBT rights, and said "while they are getting massive funds, they take no action in reality", and recognized them as symbolic entities.

On February 22, 2021, it was announced that a lawsuit had been filed against Rasan by an Islamist Kurdistan Justice Group MP because the organization advocated for local LGBT+ rights and this was "against the values of the Kurdish culture." In response to the accusation, Rasan said they would defend themselves against the lawsuit in court and they work for everyone equally. Ali spoke against the MP during a live Rudaw interview, defending the LGBT+ community and saying that the MP's comments were "baseless and not based on any scientific evidence."

She accused the coach Ramesh Powar and BCCI COA member Diana Edulji in a letter to BCCI of bias, humiliation at not including her in the T20 world cup semifinals. Powar in turn criticized that Raj had threatened that she would retire from the game of the cricket when asked to play down the batting order. He also accused Raj of 'blackmailing and pressurising coaches' apart from causing division in the team during the recently concluded World T20. He added, "despite being a senior player in the team she puts in minimum inputs in team meetings. She could not understand & adapt to the team plan. She ignored her role and batted for own milestones. Lack of keeping the momentum going which was putting extra pressure on other batters." Raj's 50 against Ireland in the same tournament in which she ended up playing 25 dot balls was also criticized by the coach, Powar.

Her relationship with the T20 team's captain Harmanpreet Kaur is also said to be strained.

However after reappointment of Ramesh Powar as Head coach of Indian womens' cricket team in May 2021 , the two have reconciled. Mithali and Harmanpreet also confirmed no bad blood against each other across various interviews.

Raj is a Bharatanatyam dancer.

After the 2017 Women's Cricket World Cup, Viacom 18 Motion Pictures acquired the rights to make a feature film on Raj's life. She said "Hoping that this movie inspires more people, especially young girls to take up sports as a career."

The biopic is in planning and the shoot is scheduled to start in 2019. Raj said "I think Priyanka Chopra will be a great choice (to play me in the biopic). Our personalities match a lot. I am not a movie buff, so I'd love the experts to do their job." However, it was decided that Taapsee Pannu will play the role of Mithali Raj in the biopic named Shabaash Mithu. It will be directed by Rahul Dholakia in 2020.

Alimony

Alimony is the idea that two people who are married are responsible for each other: This also means that if they separate or get divorced, the partner with more money or other resources has to pay a sum of money to the partner with less. 

The meaning of the term goes back to the Latin, "alimentum" (which means food).

The Code of Hammurabi (1754 BC) says that a man has to provide for his wife so she can raise his children:

During the reign of Trajan (1st century) the state supported families with many children. This support was known as "alimenta." The picture shows a Denarius, a Roman coin of the time. On the coin, the words "ALIM.ITAL." can be read. They stand for "alimenta Italia." The coin also shows Abundantia, the goddess of abundance (of food) with her children. 

The Code of Justinian also talks about alimony.

People began to pay alimony in the modern way starting in the 16th century: The Latin word "sustentatio" was directly translated. The idea was one of the first forms of social security: Family members should support each other, in case of need.

English church courts awarded alimony in cases of separation and divorce. "Alimony pendente lite" was given before the divorce decree, based on the husband's duty to support the wife during a marriage that still continued. Alimony after the divorce was also based on the idea that church courts could not undo a marriage. They could only give a "divorce a mensa et thoro", which is similar to a legal separation today. As divorce did not end the marriage, the husband still had to support his wife.

In the 19th century, divorce laws were changed, and became more liberal. Divorce was still only possible in the case of marital misconduct. As a result, the requirement to pay alimony became linked to the concept of fault in the divorce. Alimony to wives was paid because it was assumed that the marriage, and the wife's right to support, would have continued but for the misbehavior of the husband. Ending alimony on divorce would have permitted a guilty husband to profit from his own misconduct. In contrast, if the wife committed the misconduct, she was considered to have lost any claim to ongoing support. During this period, parties could rarely afford alimony, and it was rarely awarded by courts. As husbands' incomes increased, and with it the possibility of paying alimony, the awarding of alimony increased, generally because a wife could show a need for ongoing financial support, and the husband had the ability to pay. No-fault divorce led to changes in alimony. Whereas spousal support was considered a right under the fault-based system, it became conditional under the no-fault approach. According to the American Bar Association, marital fault is a "factor" in awarding alimony in twenty-five states and the District of Columbia. Permanent alimony began to fall out of favor, as it prevented former spouses from beginning new lives, though in some states (e.g., Massachusetts, Mississippi, and Tennessee), permanent alimony awards continued, but with some limitations. Alimony moved beyond support to permitting the more dependent spouse to become financially independent or to have the same standard of living as during the marriage or common law marriage, though this was not possible in most cases.

In the 1970s, the United States Supreme Court ruled against gender bias in alimony awards. That means that men could get alimony from their wives, not only women from husbands. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the percentage of male alimony recipients rose from 2.4% in 2001 to 3.6% in 2006. In states like Massachusetts and Louisiana, the salaries of new spouses may be used in determining the alimony paid to the previous partners. Most recently, in several high-profile divorces, women such as Britney Spears, Victoria Principal, and Jessica Simpson have paid multimillion-dollar settlements instead of alimony to ex-husbands. According to divorce lawyers, aggressive pursuit of spousal support by men is becoming more common, as the stigma associated with asking for alimony fades.

Today, most countries have laws about alimony. Usually, the following people are covered:


Caring can be in the form of paying money, but it can also be one of the following:

Ahmed Deedat

Ahmad Hussein Deedat (; ) was a renowned Muslim thinker, author, orator and scholar of comparative religion. Born in Surat (India) in 1918, he joined his father in South Africa in 1927. He was able to learn English in a short time and was a bright pupil. However, he had to leave school at the age of 16 to support his family. He vigorously pursued self-education, including extensive studies on comparative religion, while working in a furniture shop. He was profoundly influenced by observing that, in addition to racial discrimination, the authorities used religious ideology to “numb the masses,” and that there was a profound misunderstanding of Islam among non- Muslims. He was inspired by the concept of holding interreligious public debates, which he read about in Kairanvi’s book “Truth Revealed” He delivered his first lecture, entitled “Mohammad: Messenger of Islam” in a movie theater in Durban, with only 15 people attending. Within a short time, his lectures attracted thousands of people who crossed the racial barrier to listen to him and ask questions.

What distinguished Deedat from his contemporaries was his intensive knowledge of the Bible and Holy scriptures, coupled with his command of English.

Following this tremendous initial success, The 51 Shaikh decided to dedicate his life to the explanation of Islam and promotion of its values. His contributions, especially in the field of comparative religion, extended for more than 40 years and included his authorship of numerous books and manuscripts in addition to hundreds of audio-taped lectures, televised programs and public debates on Islam.

His mother died when he was four years old, and his father died when he was seven. As a result, he grew up an orphan but he had a stable upbringing. He was an Islamic Scholar from Saudi Arabia. And also was a teacher and a author in Unaizah, Saudi Arabia. He authored more than 40 books in several different fields including tafsir, fiqh, and 'aqidah.

He had already attracted attention at a young age with his intelligence and his strong enthusiasm for learning. After the death of his father, he had read the Qurʾān, then thoroughly memorised it by the time he was eleven years old. Then he began learning from the learned men of his town and those who visited it. He worked hard until he acquired a respectable amount of knowledge in every field. When he reached the age of twenty-three, he began teaching. Like that, he used to both learn and teach, and the entirety of his time was spent doing that. It was like that until in the year 1351H, he was placed in charge of education in his town, and became a mentor for all the students.


Tafsir

The word ‘Tafsir’ comes from the root word ‘fassara’, which means to expound or to explain. Therefore, Tafsir of Quran means the explanation or interpretations of the verses of Quran. The Tafsir of Quran is not something done by anyone with ordinary or common intellect and understanding of Islam, rather it is done by people after obtaining extensive knowledge about Islam and reading the history of Islam thoroughly. The objective of a Tafsir is to find out the true meanings of the verses of Quran, so that the audience could benefit from it and know the right and true message of Quran.

Quran is the word of Allah Almighty, therefore, in order to understand it in the true sense, a person has to sharpen his or her intellectual ability as well as increase the knowledge. When one is at a particular intellectual level, only then can he or she start understanding the true message, which Allah Almighty conveyed through words of Quran. Pertaining to the explanation of Quran for the understanding of general audience, different people have tried to write the Tafsir of Quran. Although Muslims recite Quran and try reading it with translation, however, the reading of Tafsir has its own importance. The lines below discuss what Tafsir is, why is it important and its different kinds.

Muslims also believe in previous revelations, such as the "Tawrat" (Torah), the "Zabur" (Psalms), the "Injeel" (Gospel), the "Scrolls of Abraham", and the "Scrolls of Moses". The Islamic methodology of () refers to interpreting the Qur'an with/through the Bible. This approach adopts canonical Arabic versions of the Bible, including the Tawrat and the Injil, both to illuminate and to add exegetical depth to the reading of the Qur'an. Notable Muslim (commentators) of the Bible and Qur'an who weaved biblical texts together with Qur'anic ones include Abu al-Hakam Abd al-Salam bin al-Isbili of Al-Andalus and Ibrahim bin Umar bin Hasan al-Biqa'i.

There is a variety of reasons why Tafsir is important and people consult Tafsir when it comes to understanding of Quran. The few important reasons that make Tafsir important are as follows:

Safety in numbers

Individuals that are part of a larger group are less likely to be the victim of an accident, attack, or other bad event. This idea is called safety in numbers. Related theories show that mass behaviour can reduce accident risks. In the case of traffic safety, the effect really reduces the danger, rather than simply distributing it over a larger group.

The mathematical biologist W.D. Hamilton proposed his selfish herd theory in 1971. This theory tries to explain why animals seek central positions in a group: each individual can reduce its own danger by putting itself in a position with neighbours all around. So it moves towards the centre of the group. The effect was tested in brown fur seal predation by great white sharks. Decoy seals were used, and the distance between them was varied to produce different levels of danger. The seals in greater danger had (as predicted) an increased risk of shark attack. Antipredator adaptations include behaviour such as the flocking of birds, herding of sheep, and schooling of fish. Similarly, before jumping into the water, Adelie penguins wait until their group is large enough: this reduces the risk of seal predation for each penguin in the group. 

The same result can be seen when predators face a large number of prey animals: the chance of each prey animal surviving is greater.

In 1949 R. J. Smeed reported that per capita road death rates tended to be lower in countries where more people owned a motor vehicle. This observation led to Smeed's Law.

In 2003 P. L. Jacobsen compared rates of walking and cycling, in different countries. Jacobsen looked at the rates of collisions between motorists and cyclists or walkers. He found an inverse relationship. He used a concept called 'behavioural adaptation' to explain this. The concept says that drivers who are exposed to more cyclists on the road begin to drive more safely around them. Though an attractive concept for cycling advocates, it has not been empirically validated. Other combined modelling and empirical evidence suggests that while changes in driver behaviour might still be one way that collision risk per cyclist declines with greater numbers, the effect can be easily produced through simple spatial processes similar to the biological herding processes described above.

Without consideringthe other two hypotheses, Jacobsen concluded that "A motorist is less likely to collide with a person walking and bicycling if more people walk or bicycle." He described this theory as "safety in numbers."

Safety in numbers is also used to describe the following evidence: The number of pedestrians or cyclists correlates inversely with the risk of a motorist colliding with a pedestrian or cyclist. This non-linear relationship was first shown at intersections. Ecologic data from cities in California and Denmark, and European countries, as well as time-series data for the United Kingdom and the Netherlands confirmed it. The number of pedestrians or bicyclists injured increases at a slower rate than would be expected based on their numbers. That is, more people walk or cycle where the risk to the individual pedestrian or bicyclist is lower. A 2002 study looked at the question whether pedestrian risk decreased with pedestrian flow. The study used 1983-86 data from signalized intersections in a town in Canada. It found that in some cases pedestrian flow increased where the risk per pedestrian decreased.

After cycling was promoted in Finland, there was a 75% drop in cyclists deaths and the number of trips increased by 72%.

Between 2000 and 2008, serious bicycle injuries in England declined by 12%. Over the same period, the number of bicycle trips made in London doubled.

The percentaghe of trips made by bicycle rose from 15% to 18%.

In Germany, between 1975 and 2001, the total number of bicycle trips made in Berlin increased four-fold. Between 1990 and 2007, the percentage of trips made by bicycle increased from 5% to 10%. Between 1992 and 2006, the number of serious bicycle injuries fell by 38%.

Between 1992 and 2008, the number of bicyclists crossing four bridges into downtown was measured to have increased 369% between 1992 and 2008. During that same period, the number of reported crashes increased by only 14%.

Āyah

Ayah (Arabic: آية āyah, plural آيات āyāt); is the Arabic word for omen, sign, proof, commandment, law, rule and/or guidance. The word is usually used to refer to a verse of the Qur’an. An ayah is the smallest unit of the Qur’an; Muslims believe that each of the 6236 ayah of the Qur’an is a sign from God (called Allāh in Arabic). Chapters in the Qur’an, called surah in Arabic, are made up of several ayahs, though a sura may vary greatly in length, ranging from 3 to 286 ayahs. such as:

Al Imran

Al-Imran ( Arabic : آل عمران) is the third chapter of the Qur'an, with 200 verses and 20 ruku's. Surah Al-Imran was revealed in Medina.

Verses 33 to 35 of this Surah speak of "Ali-Imran" or "Descendants of Imran". Its name has been considered as a sign. (The correct pronunciation of the name of this surah is 'Ali Imran'). Imran is the grandfather of Isa (AS).

The first sermon starts from the first of the sura and continues till verse 32 and it was probably revealed near the battle of Badr.

The second speech starts from verse 33 and ends in verse 63 (up to the end of the 6th verse). It was revealed in the 9th Hijri when the Najran delegation arrived.

The third speech is from the beginning of the seventh ruku to the end of the twelfth ruku. It was revealed with the first speech.

The fourth discourse continues from the thirteenth ruku 'to the end of the surah. It was revealed after the battle of Uhod.

Verses: 

1: Alif Lam Meem. 

2: There is no god but Allah, He is the Ever-Living, the Possessor of all things. 

3: He has sent down to you the Book with the truth; Which confirms the previous books. 

4: The Torah and the Gospel have been sent down before this Book for the guidance of mankind, and the Revelation has been sent down. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah - for them is a severe punishment. And Allah is Mighty, Avenger. 

5: Nothing in the heavens and the earth is hidden from Allah. 

6: He is the God who shapes you in the womb as He wills. There is no god but Him. He is the Almighty, the Wise. 

7: He is the One who sent down the Book to you. There are some clear verses in it, they are the real part of the book. And the others are metaphorical. So those who have crookedness in their hearts, They follow the metaphors in them for the purpose of spreading sedition and misinterpretation. And no one knows their interpretation except Allah. And those who are deep in knowledge say: We believe in it. All this is a revelation from our Lord. And no one receives education except those who are endowed with understanding.

8: Our Lord! Thou wilt not lead our hearts astray after Our guidance, and bestow on us grace from Thee. You are the giver of everything. 

9: Our Lord! You will surely bring people together one day - there is no doubt about it. GOD does not fulfill His promise. 

10: Those who disbelieve, their wealth and their children will not avail them aught against Allah. And they are the fuel of Hell. 

11: The people of Pharaoh and those before them denied My revelations. As a result, GOD seized them for their sins, and GOD's retribution was severe. 

12: Tell the disbelievers that they will soon be defeated and driven to Hell. What a miserable position. 

13: Surely there was a sign for you between the two parties. A party fights in the way of Allah. And the other party was the disbelievers, who saw them with their own eyes. And whom Allah strengthens with His help. In the meantime, there are lessons for those who have vision. 

14: - Mankind has been fascinated by women, children, zodiac gold and silver, marked horses, cattle and farms. All these are the consumables of worldly life. The best refuge is with God.

Surah An-Nisa ( Arabic: سورة النساء, Sūratu an-Nisā, meaning "female") is the fourth surah of the Muslim religious book, the Qur'an , with 176 verses and 24 ruku's. Surah An-Nisa has been revealed in Medina . This surah talks about how Muslims should lead their lives and stay united.

This Surah is the sum of several speeches. Probably from the end of the third Hijri to the end of the fourth Hijri or from the beginning of the fifth Hijri, different parts of it were revealed at different times. Although it is not possible to say exactly from which verse to which verse a revelation was included in a speech and what was the time of its revelation, some provisions and events have been pointed out somewhere to help us know the date of their revelation from tradition. . So with the help of these we can point out a general limit of these speeches containing these provisions and hints.

As we know, the provisions regarding the distribution of inheritance and the rights of orphans were revealed after the battle of Uhud. Then seventy Muslims were martyred. As a result of this incident, the question arose as to how the inheritance of the martyrs would be distributed in different houses of the small settlements of Medina and how the interests of the orphans they had left would be preserved. On the basis of this, we can assume that the first four verses, and the first three verses of the fifth verse will have been revealed at this time.

We find in the hadith the tradition of reciting the prayer of fear (praying while fighting) in the battle of Jatur Rika. This battle took place in the fourth Hijri. So it can be inferred here that the speech (15 Ruku) in which the rules of prayer have been explained will have been revealed in the near future.

Bani Nadir was expelled from Medina in the month of Rabiul Awwal of the fourth Hijri. Therefore, the last warning given to the Jews in this speech, "Believe me before I disfigure your face," can be presumed to have been revealed at a very near time.

Tayammum was allowed due to lack of water during the battle of Banil Mustaliq. And this battle took place in the fifth Hijri. Therefore, it should be remembered that the speech in which (7th Ruku) mentioned Tayammum was revealed at that time.


Al-Ma'idah

Surah Al-Maidah (Arabic: سورة المائدة) is the 5th surah of the Muslim religious book, the Qur'an , which has 120 verses and 18 ruku's. The Surah was revealed in Medina.

It is named after the word 'Maidah' mentioned in a verse of 15 Ruku of this Surah. The word mayidah means 'dining table' or 'a table in which food is served'. Like most of the surahs in the Qur'an, the name of this surah has nothing to do with its subject matter. It has been called by this name merely to distinguish it from other Surahs.

This Surah was revealed at the end of 6 AH or at the beginning of 6 AH after the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah . This is clear from the subject matter of the Surah and the various narrations of the Hadith also prove its authenticity. The event of the month of Zilqad in the sixth Hijri. Fourteen, with Muslims the Prophet Muhammad Umrah to perform there has arisen. But the Quraish disbelievers, out of enmity, completely opposed the oldest religious tradition in Arabia and did not allow him to perform Umrah . After much debate and debate, they agreed that next year you can come to visit the house of God. At this time, on the one hand, the Muslims had a KaabaIt was necessary to explain the rules of pilgrimage for the purpose of pilgrimage, so that the Umrah could be performed with full Islamic dignity next year, and on the other hand, it was necessary to urge them to respond to the excesses of the infidel enemies by not allowing them to perform Umrah. Let them take the lead, so that they may not again oppress the disbelievers. Because Hajj to many disbelieving tribesThe tour had to go through Muslim-dominated areas. In the same way that the Muslims were not allowed to visit the Ka'bah, they could have forcibly blocked the way of visiting the Ka'bah of these disbelieving tribes. This is the context in which the introductory speech at the beginning of this Surah is discussed. This issue has been raised again in the front thirteen ruku's. This proves that the same speech continues from the first ruku to the fourteenth ruku. In addition, all the other contents we find in this Surah seem to be of the same period

The continuity of the narration suggests that this entire surah is included in a single discourse and that it was probably revealed at the same time. Again, some of its verses may have been revealed later separately and due to the unity of content, they have been included in different places of this Surah. But nowhere in the continuity of narration is the slightest emptiness felt. As a result, there is no time to think of it as the sum of two or three speeches.


Al-An'am

Surah Al-An'am (Arabic: سورة الأنعام, "meaning the animal") Muslim religious texts of the Qur'an 6 Number of Surat , the number of verses 165 and the number of rukura. This Surah was revealed in Makkah . This Surah Allah's Oneness, punarutthana, Heaven and Hell have been discussed.

In this Surah, in the 16th and 18th Ruku, the imaginary and superstitious idea of ​​the Arabs regarding the prohibition of some An'am (domesticated animals) and the halal of some of them has been refuted. In this context, this Surah has been named Al An'am.

According to Ibn 'Abbas, this entire Surah was revealed in Makkah at the same time. Hazrat Asma bint Yazid , the cousin of Hazrat Muaz Ibn Jabal , said that this Surah was revealed while the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was riding on a camel. Then I was holding the reins of her camel. Under the weight of the burden, the camel's condition had reached such a level that it seemed as if this understanding would break her bones. It is also clearly stated in the hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recorded this Surah on the night it was revealed.

If we think about its subject matter, it is clear that this Surah would have been revealed towards the end of the Meccan period. The narration of Hazrat Asma bint Yazid also proves this to be true. Because he belonged to the Ansar. After the migration he converted to Islam. If he had attended the service of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in Makkah out of sheer devotion before accepting Islam, he would surely have been in the last year of his stay in Makkah. Earlier, his relationship with the people of Yasreb was not so close that one of their women could come to his service.


Al-A'raf

Surah Al-A'raf (Arabic: سورة الأعراف, meaning "high place") is the seventh book of the Muslim religious book, the Qur'an , with 206 verses and 24 ruku's. This Surah was revealed in Makkah . The central theme of this Surah is the call to believe in the Prophethood.

In verses 46 and 48 of this surah (in the fifth verse) the Araf or the people of Araf are mentioned in the Companions. That is why it is named Al Araf. In other words, the meaning of calling this Surah Surah Al-A'raf is that it is the Surah in which A'raf is mentioned.

Looking at the subject matter of this Surah, it is clear that this Surah was revealed at about the same time as Surah An-Amr . Of course, it cannot be said with certainty whether it was revealed before or after An'am. However, from the eloquence of the speech given in this Surah, it is clear that it is related to that time. Therefore, in order to understand its historical background, it is enough to take a look at the introduction written at the beginning of Surah An-Nam.

Scientists do not know whether this frog is in danger of dying out, but they say that the forests where it lives are in a lot of danger. Human beings take wood to burn for fuel. Humans cut down forests to make towns and farms and places for goats to eat grass.

Al-Anfal

Al-Anfal (Arabic: الأنفال) Muslim religious texts of the Qur'an 8 Number chapter , verses 75. Surah Al-Anfal was revealed in Medina.

The name of this Surah is Surah Al-Anfal; This is because the word is mentioned in the first verse of the Surah, which means war-acquired wealth. Most of its descriptions are related to this. Some have even named it Surah Badr. [Bukhari: 482] Because, most of the discussion was about the battle of Badr. Some have also called this Surah as 'Jihad'.

This Surah was revealed in the second Hijri after the battle of Badr. This is a detailed review of the first battle between Islam and Kufr.


At-Tawbah

Surah At-Tawbah (Arabic: سورة التوبة , "Repentance"), also known as Surah Bar'ah or Bar'at (Rejection) is the ninth surah of the Muslim religious book, the Qur'an . This Surah was revealed in Medina and has 129 verses. Arabic repentance means forgiveness. It is called Surah Tawba, because it describes the acceptance of Muslims' repentance. The other name of the surah is Bara'at - it is called Bara'at because it refers to the separation of the disbelievers from the disbelievers and their release from responsibility.


Yunus (surah)

Surah Yunus (Arabic: سورة يونس) is the tenth surah of the Qur'an , a religious book for Muslims. This Surah was revealed in Makkah and has 109 verses. Koraana and the principles of Islam uddesyabali this Surah Tawheed , Prophethood , Hereafter etc. bisbacaracara the merits and the evidence showing the changing-changing events has been arranged to be understood better. Along with some didactic, historical events and the introduction of the story he has to be careful of all the people who have God, the Cherisher and the public on the signs do not think about it.


Al-Fatiha


The word Fatiha is derived from the Arabic word "Fathun" which means "opening up". It has been named in accordance with the content of this Surah. The one with the help of which a subject, book or thing is inaugurated is called 'Fatiha'. In other words, the word conveys the meaning of introduction and beginning of speech.

There are four other names of this surah in the hadith, one of which is Ummul. However, there are at least 23 titles of this surah in Islamic writing. It is called Saba Masani or the widely read seven verses.

There are several other names for this surah. Such as- Fatihatul Kitab, Ummul Kitab, Suratul-Hamd, Suratus-Salat, As-Sabi'ul Masani.

As this sura is the foundation of Islamic prayer, most Islamic scholars hold that it was revealed in Mecca early in Muhammad's career. One tradition has Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad's son-in-law, one of his earliest followers and his rightful successor in the eyes of Shi'ite Muslims, saying: "The Opening of the Book was revealed in Mecca from a treasure beneath the divine throne." The eleventh-century Islamic scholar al-Wahidi relates a tradition in which the Fatiha constituted the first revelation of the Qur’an, rather than the famous demand from the angel that Muhammad "recite," which sura 96 currently enshrines as the first revelation of the Qur'an. Al-Awahidi adds, "This is also the opinion of Ali ibn Abi Talib." This belief persisted to the extent that the twelfth-century Persian Islamic Scholar and jurist Zamakhshari states that most Qur'an commentators at the time he was writing believed that the Fatiha was the first sura revealed. The idea is that the Fatiha was the beginning of the Qur'anic revelation. However, it is a minority view, with mainstream Islamic scholars today holding that sura 96, or at least the start of it, was the first revelation to come to Muhammad.

Instead of "Praise be to Allah," the seventeenth-century Shi'ite scholar Muhammad Baqir Majlisi has, "We greatly praise Allah."

Instead of "the compassionate, the merciful" "(ar-rahman ar-rahim)," a variant seen in Cairo by the Qur'anic scholar Arthur Jeffery (1892-1959) has "the sustainer, the merciful" (ar-razzaqi ar-rahimi).

Instead of "master of the day of judgment," the Warsh Qur'an has "king of the day of judgment."

The Last Girl (memoir)

The Last Girl: My Story of Captivity, and My Fight Against the Islamic State is a autobiographical book by Nadia Murad in which she tells how she was captured and enslaved by the Islamic State during the Second Iraqi Civil War. Murad won the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize for this book.

In the first part of the book, Murad writes about growing up in the Yazidi village of Kocho, Sinjar District. She lived there with her mother, two older sisters and eight older brothers. Murad writes about several disputes with nearby Sunni villages and terrorist attacks that she remembered. She then talks about the August 2014 occupation of Kocho by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. During the occupation, ISIS people killed many people in Kocho in a massacre. Some of the people of Kocho ran away to the Sinjar Mountains, and the rest were kidnapped by ISIS. The ISIS agents told the men still in Kocho that they had to change religions. The men of Kocho said no, and the ISIS agents killed them. Young women were kidnapped as sexual slaves. Murad criticized Peshmerga troops for running away from Kocho one day before the massacre.

In the second part of the book, Murad tells the readers about what happened to her during the Second Iraqi Civil War. ISIS agents took her and other women to an place in Solagh. She was then taken to Mosul, which had been captured by ISIS in June 2014. Yazidi women who weren't enslaved were attacked by anyone who wanted to hurt them. A high-ranking militant wanted to buy Murad, but she convinced a skinnier judge to buy her instead. When Murad was in Al-Hamdaniya District, she tried attempted to escape through a window. The guards who caught her raped her and sent her away to an ISIS checkpoint. She was imprisoned there and raped by people passing. Then she was bought by someone in Mosul again. There, she successfully and easily escaped that man, who had left the front door unlocked. She said that was miraculous.

In the third part of the book, Murad talks about how she escaped from ISIS-held territory. First, she walked around Mosul for almost two hours. Then she saw a family and asked them for help. They agreed to help her run away. Murad used fake identities to escape with the family's younger son. The family sent him away with Murad so he would not join ISIS. Murad and the boy entered Iraqi Kurdistan, but they kept their fake identities so that no one would use Murad's status as a former slave for political reasons. Murad found she could not leave Sulaymaniyah, so she decided to tell her story to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The PUK gave the interview to the media, even though they had said they wouldn't. This meant that the family who had helped Murad in Mosul were in danger. Murad found some people from her family, and she waited to learn about the rest. Her mother had been killed in Solagh, and Nadia's niece Kathrine, who had tried to escape six times, had been killed in the same explosion blast that injured Lamiya Aji Bashar. Six of Murad's brothers had been killed, and one of her nephews had become an ISIS soldier.

Murad's attorney is Amal Clooney, a Lebanese-British barrister. Clooney wrote the foreword to "The Last Girl".
"The Last Girl" was released for sale in the UK, Germany and Netherlands on October 31, 2017. Rights to print the book were sold in twenty other territories. According to the Associated Press, Murad noted in a statement "that she had lost numerous friends and family members to ISIS and hoped her story would 'influence world leaders to act. The book was released right after the October 2017 Iraqi–Kurdish conflict.

First-wave feminism

First-wave feminism was a time of feminist activity and thought in the Western world. It happened during the 19th and early 20th century. It focused on laws about women, mainly giving women the right to vote. Later waves of feminism would focus on things like economic equality and social equality.

Journalist Martha Lear was the first to call it "first-wave feminism". She did this in an article she wrote for "New York Times Magazine" in March 1968. It was called "The Second Feminist Wave: What do these women want?" First-wave feminism focused on women's power under law. Second-wave feminism was about economic and social power, for example, equal pay for equal work.

In her book "The Second Sex," Simone de Beauvoir wrote that the first woman to "take up her pen in defense of her sex" was Christine de Pizan. Christine de Pizan wrote in the 15th century. Feminists Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and Modesta di Pozzo di Forzi worked in the 16th century. Marie le Jars de Gournay, Anne Bradstreet and François Poullain de la Barre's Equality of sexes came out in 1673.

Black stilt

The black stilt or kaki ("Himantopus novaezelandiae") is a bird in the family Recurvirostridae. It lives in New Zealand.

This bird has black feathers and long legs.

The black stilt lives next to rivers and lakes, in swamps and by ponds. It goes to rivers, streams, or swamps to lay eggs. It goes further inland for the winter. But because these areas are usually close to each other, scientists do not think of it as a migratory bird.

This bird wades into the water to look for food.

As of 2021 there were about 170 of these birds alive in the wild. In 1981, there were only 23 birds. There are fewer of them because of invasive species, animals that humans brought to New Zealand. Cats and ferrets kill many stilts, chicks, and eggs. Human beings also change the places where the birds like to live. Human beings using the seashore for work or fun can scare the adult birds away from the nests. They can accidentally kill the chicks or eggs.

The Kakī Recovery Programme keeps some breeding pairs. They put the eggs in incubators until they hatch. They raise the chicks by hand until they are too big for cats or ferrets to eat easily. They also take eggs from wild nests. That way, predators cannot eat the parents as they sit on the nest.

In some parts of New Zealand, for example Tasman River, human beings try to stop the predators from eating the birds. It has worked.

Qubo Night Owl

The Qubo Night Owl was a programming block at night that ran from 12AM to 6AM (Eastern Time).

In August 2013, however, the contract for the Filmation shows lapsed and newer acquisitions filled the block. The block suffered network decay (or in this case, "block decay") for most of its run, adding preschool shows and shows for older kids that would be normally seen during the daytime hours as opposed to the undesirable graveyard slots. After five and a half years of abandoning its original focus, the block appeared for the final time on January 7, 2019 as it was replaced with infomercials the following day, marking the first time the channel has followed the trope of networks airing infomercials during the graveyard hours (even though it was stated in a 2010 sizzle reel that they would never do such a thing, proving further that time does fly by fast in a decade). From the screen bug for Qubo Night Owl only appeared during the midnight hour (when Sidekick, Zoo Clues and Safari Tracks usually aired at the time). As of June 17, 2019, the Qubo Night Owl screenbug no longer appears.

Alfhild was a daughter of the Geatish king Synardus that lived in modern Sweden. Historians do not know if she was a real person or a legend. If she did live, it was probably between the 5th and 12th centuries. The earliest piece of writing that talks about her is the Gesta Danorum.

When Alfhild was a young princess, the room she slept in was guarded by a lizard and a snake. These reptiles scared away suitors who were not brave. A Danish prince named Alf, who was also Geatish, came to Geatland and fought the animal guards and won. But Alfhild's mother told her to run away from Alf dressed as a man. She did, and she became a woman fighter called a shield maiden. 

She found a group of pirate ships that had lost their captain. She became the captain and made the other women part of the sailing crew. The crew doubled in number.

She was so good at piracy that she hurt a large part of the Danish and Finnish shipping economy. She also sailed to Iceland once. Prince Alf then went to stop the fleet. At that time, he did not know that Alfhild was pirate leader. He found them off the coast of Finland. 

In the original story, Alfhild killed Alf, the latter underestimating the fleet's power, and then put his head on a spear and continued pirating. People know this from Norse hearsay in dining halls. 

In Christian story, she knocked off his helmet. This made her recognize him, and she stopped pirating and married Alf. She then became queen of Denmark. This version is probably wrong: It agreed with the things Christianity and patriarchy saw as good.

There are some differences in the story in later popular culture. Here Alfhild is almost always called Awilda. (Other spellings: "Alwilda, Alvilda, Alvild, Alvilde, Alfhilda, Avilda, Alvida, Altilda, Ælfhild").

During the 1800s, Alfhild/Awilda was a popular subject for scrimshaw carved by sailors on whaling ships.

The story about Alf And Alfhild has also been made into Italian operas.

In 1686, ""L'Amazzone Corsara, ovvero L'Alvilda, regina de Goti"," by Carlo Pallavicino.

From TV Animation: One Piece Treasure Battle!

One Piece: Treasure Battle! (トレジャーバトル!, Torejā Batoru!) is a party game for the Nintendo Gamecube, published by Bandai and released in November 2002. It was the first "One Piece" game designed for a sixth-generation console, as well as the first to feature fully three-dimensional gameplay.

There is a special competition called the "Treasure Battle" clash which is being hosted in the Grand Line on a special series of islands. The "Blueberry Times" newspaper is covering the events via journalist Rocky Hattari. The Straw Hats, along with Vivi and Ace, should trust each other and work together in a group made of two members and battle through various events to get Treasure Cards. The Treasure Cards are said to give the possessor happiness and can make wishes and dreams come true. The Straw Hats, Vivi, and Ace decided to compete. Luffy and Vivi pair up together. Zoro and Ace, who were not interested in the treasure but their competitive sides are rubbed, so they join "just to win". Sanji followed Nami, who is joining for the treasure. Chopper was amazed hearing that Usopp had a plan. Thus, the teams were decided.


Story mode. There are 4 stories to choose from:

The player will fight 3 Treasure Battles in a row, then have a special mini game for the 4th, and then a best-of-3 round Treasure Battle for the conclusion.

A Treasure Battle is a fight between two teams. The team that can successfully carry a treasure to a goal, preventing the other team from taking it until time up, wins. After winning a Treasure Battle in the story mode; players get a Treasure Card.

The player chooses the stages and characters.

"Treasure Battle" is a (two-player-in-each) team game, and has players grabbing a treasure chest and putting it into a boxing ring at the end of each island level, then literally waiting for their ship to come in. Once their pirate ship arrives, that team wins. A team can throw the chest to each other over a limited distance, lob it in the direction they are facing over a greater distance, or even use it to attack the members of the opposite team who are doing their best to grab the treasure chest and take it back to their own boxing ring, and their awaiting pirate vessel.

The screen is split in the "Treasure Battle" according to how many human players are involved. In one-player mode, the full screen allows a decent view of the action, but the 2- and 4-player splits reduce the action to an extremely small view that can make it very hard to determine what is really happening.

"Battle Royal" is a similar game to "Treasure Battle", except there is no chest and the arena is more confined. Each team just bashes the opposition about, as much as possible, for just under 3 minutes. All players are displayed on the full screen, which will zoom in and out depending on the spread of the action.

"Kung Fu Survival" both teams are placed on to a very small island inhabited by large numbers of Kung-Fu Dugongs. Whichever team beats up the most dugongs within the time limit wins. The player can walk right up to a dugong and attack it in the face, or if they choose Zoro they can have him attack with a kendo. The dugongs are basically defenseless, but if a player is standing motionless, may wander over and attack with a headbutt or flipper strike.

"Teamwork Rally" has each team passing the chest to each other across gaps that can't be jumped over whilst carrying the chest. The race to the finish is a careful balance between taking risks to get the edge over the opposition and being careful at other points to avert disaster.

"Cross Country" is an individual race to the end of each stage of a longer race. Each player gets a score based on their position at each intermediate stage and the team scores are totaled at the end of the whole race. The race is conducted along a series of different jumps, ladders, islands and narrow passageways.

"Pirate Soccer" is pirates playing soccer. Except the ball is enormous and can crush the players if they fall under it. They have to use their attack moves to push the ball through goals at each end. Each half is 90 seconds.

"Treasure Hunt" has players wondering around randomly until an arrow appears, directing them to hidden treasure.

Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God

The Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God was a new religious movement in Uganda. It existed from the 1980s, to the early 2000s. Credonia Mwerinde and Joseph Kibweteere founded it. They said the virgin Mary had appeared to them. The group split from the Roman Catholic Church. The group wanted to restore the Ten Commandments. They said that only by strictly following the Ten Commandments would they be saved. 

In 1998, the group was first noticed, because they made children work in a school they operated. There was also a very bad hygiene at that school. 

There was the text "A Timely Message from Heaven: The End of the Present Time," which they considered to be their gospel. Each group member was expected to have read it at least six times. The teachings of the group were that those worthy of salvation would be saved, but that all the others would be punished. Credonia Mwerinde was seen as the incarnation of the Virgin Mary. 

According to the group, the world would end on 31st December 1999. When the world did not end that day, people became suspicious. They wanted their posessions back, which they had transferred to the group beforehand. According to survivers, people who asked to get their possessions back would mysteriously disappear. The first 530 followers died at a religious service, in a church, on 17th March 2000. The leaders of the cult had the doors nailed shut. Then they poured petrol on the wooden church, and put in on fire. Today, it is certain that Joseph Kibweteere was not among the dead in the church. He was seen alive, the following day. During the following days, several bodies were discovered on the farms of the group. In total, over 1,000 people died.

Medical examinations later determined that the majority of dead sect members had been poisoned. Early reports suggested that they had been strangled based on the presence of twisted banana fibers around their necks. After searching all sites, the police concluded that earlier estimates of nearly a thousand dead had been exaggerated, even though the final death toll was 924.

After interviews and an investigation, the police ruled out a cult suicide, and instead consider it to be a mass murder by the Movement leadership. They believe that the failure of the doomsday prophecy led to a revolt in the ranks of the sect, and the leaders set a new date with a plan to kill their followers. The discovery of bodies at other sites, the fact the church had been boarded up, the presence of incendiaries, and the possible disappearance of sect leaders all point to this theory. Additionally, witnesses said the Movement leadership had never spoken of mass suicide when preparing members for the end of the world. A survivor recalled meeting a devout member of the cult with nails and a hammer on his way after he had left the cult. It is believed he is the one who shut the windows with nails to prevent any one from escaping.

The Ugandan government condemned the killings. President Yoweri Museveni called the event a "mass murder by these priests for monetary gain". Vice president Dr. Speciosa Wandira Kazibwe said, "These were [...] well-orchestrated mass murders [carried out] by a network of diabolic, malevolent criminals masquerading as religious people."

At the start, the five leaders were believed to have died in the fire. Police now believe that Joseph Kibweteere and Credonia Mwerinde may still be alive, and have issued an international warrant for their arrest. In 2014, the Uganda National Police announced that there were reports that Kibweteere was hiding in Malawi.

Phyllomedusa bicolor

The blue and yellow frog, waxy monkey tree frog, bicolored frog or giant monkey frog ("Phyllomedusa bicolor") is a frog that lives in Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, and the Guianas. Scientists think it might also live in Ecuador. People have seen this frog as high as 800 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is to long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is to long. The skin on its back is dark green and the belly can be white or yellow. It has white spots with dark outlines on its front. There are even more spots on its sides. It has brown disks on its toes for climbing. The iris of its eye is gray in color.

This frog makes chemicals in its skin that people put on arrows. The chemicals are poison.

This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. When it is time to lay eggs, the female finds a leaf on a branch hanging over a pond. She folds the leaf to make a nest. She puts 600 eggs at a time in the nest and covers them in jelly. The eggs take 8-10 days to hatch. The tadpoles fall out of the nest into the pond.

Scientists think this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place. Cutting down forests is not good for this frog, and sometimes people sell them as pets, but the frog is not in danger.

Century common year

In the Gregorian calendar, a century common year is a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400. Therefore, like all other common years, these years do not have a February 29. This is the only case where a year that is divisible by 4 is a common year. 

In the obsolete Julian calendar, all years divisible by 4, including century years, were leap years. This rule resulted in too many leap years, so the Gregorian calendar added a new rule that a century year must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. This is why the years 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years, while 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, and 2300 are common years even though they are all divisible by 4. The Gregorian calendar was introduced in 1582, so the first century common year was 1700. 

The start days of century common years varies. The century year begins on Friday if the remainder obtained by dividing it by 400 is 100, Wednesday if the remainder is 200, and Monday if the remainder is 300. Thus, century leap years always begin on Saturday.

In 1914, she supported Britain going to war against Germany in World War I.

Christabel Pankhurst was the daughter of Emmeline Pankhurst and Richard Pankhurst. She had two sisters: Sylvia and Adela Pankhurst. Her father was a barrister, which is a high-ranking lawyer, and her mother owned a small shop.

Pankhurst learned to read at home on her own before she went to school. She went to Manchester High School for Girls with her two sisters. She got a law degree from the University of Manchester, and received honours on her LL.B. exam. However, Pankhurst could not practise law because she was a woman. British law did not allow women to be lawyers at that time.

Christabel died 13 February 1958, at the age of 77. She was buried in the Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery in Santa Monica, California.

There is a profile bust, which is a small statue, of Christabel Pankhurst on the right pylon of the Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst Memorial in Victoria Tower Gardens. The sculpture was put there in 1959.

Luník IX

Luník IX is a borough (city ward) in the city of Košice, Slovakia, in the Košice II district. It is located in the western-central part of the city, surrounded by the boroughs of Pereš, Myslava, Barca, Juh and Západ.

Luník IX houses the largest community of Romani people in Slovakia. It was originally built for 2,500 people. Estimates are that its population in 2021 is three times larger. Living standards are low. Services such as gas, water, and electricity are usually cut off, because the majority of inhabitants are not paying rent or utilities fees.

Health standards are low: diseases such as hepatitis, head lice, diarrhoea, scabies, and meningitis are common. Almost all people in the borough do not have a job. The borough has one elementary school and a kindergarten.

Luník IX is serviced by a bus line, which stops only on selected bus stops. Boarding the bus is only allowed through the front door. Due to frequent attacks of aggressive residents, bus drivers deployed on the line receive a hazard pay.

There was a Romani village which was close by, but it was demolished in 1979. The Romani people were moved into Lunik IX. There was a landfill nearby. In the 1980s, about 2.000 people lived in Lunik IX, about half of them were Romani. Over time, the non-Romani population moved away, with the Romani taking flats after their departure, and the borough turned into a Romani ghetto.

In 1995, the city council of Košice created a plan for the living conditions of dodgers, the maladjusted, and people from illegally occupied flats around Košice. They were to be moved into Luník IX, with "non-problematic" families being moved out if they requested it. The realization of this plan is on-going.

Exploitation of natural resources

The exploitation of natural resources is the use of natural resources for economic growth, sometimes with a negative result in regards with the environment. It started to come out on an industrial scale in the 19th century as the extraction and processing of raw materials (such as in mining, steam power, and machinery) developed much further than it had in preindustrial areas. During the 20th century, energy use quickly increased. Today, about 80% of the world's energy use is sustained by the extraction of fossil fuels, which consists of oil, coal and natural gas.

History of the Catholic Church

The history of the Catholic Church is the formation, events, and change of the Catholic Church through time.

The Catholic Church began with Jesus Christ and his teachings. It is a continuation of the early Christian community established by the Disciples of Jesus. The Church believes its bishops to be the successors to Jesus's apostles and the Church's leader, the Bishop of Rome (also known as the Pope), to be the only successor to Saint Peter who ministered in Rome in the first century AD after his appointment by Jesus as head of the Church.

Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, with all persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. In 313, the persecutions were lessened by the Edict of Milan with the legalization of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine I. In 380, under Emperor Theodosius, Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire by the Edict of Thessalonica.

The battles of Toulouse preserved the Christian west against the Umayyad Muslim army, even though Rome itself was destroyed in 850, and Constantinople attacked. In the 11th century, already difficult relations between the mostly Greek church in the East, and the Latin church in the West, developed into the East-West Schism, partially due to conflicts over the Pope's authority. Before and during the 16th century, the Church started a process of reform and renewal. Reform during the 16th century is known as the Counter-Reformation. In later centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world even though it experienced a reduction of European believers due to the growth of Protestantism and also because of religious doubt and distrust during and after the Enlightenment. The Second Vatican Council in the 1960s introduced the most big changes to Catholic practices since the Council of Trent four centuries before.

According to Catholic tradition, the Catholic Church was founded by Jesus Christ. The New Testament narrates about Jesus' activities, teaching, his appointment of the twelve Apostles, and his instructions to them to continue his work. The Catholic Church teaches that Pentocost signaled the beginning of the public ministry of the Church. In this event, the Holy Spirit came upon the apostles.

According to the Catholic Church, Christ desginated Peter as the "rock" upon which he would build his church. Catholics hold that Saint Peter was Rome's first bishop. He started the unbroken line which includes the current pontiff, Pope Francis. That is, the Catholic Church maintains the apostolic succession of the Bishop of Rome, the Pope, who is the successor to Saint Peter.

Conditions in the Roman Empire facilitated the spread of new ideas. The empire's network of roads and waterways allowed easier travel. Also, the Pax Romana made it safe to travel from one region to another. The government had encouraged inhabitants to learn Greek. Having a common language allowed ideas to be more easily expressed. Jesus's apostles gained converts in Jewish communities around the Mediterranean Sea. They established over 40 Christian communities by 100. Although most of these were in the Roman Empire, notable Christian communities were also established in Armenia, Iran and along the Indian Malabar Coast. The new religion was most successful in urban areas and it spread first among slaves and people of low social standing, and then among aristocratic women.

At first, Christians continued to worship alongside Jewish believers. However, twenty years after Jesus's death, Sunday was being regarded as the primary day of worship.

Christianity established itself as a separate religion when preachers such as Paul of Tarsus began converting Gentiles . To solve doctrinal differences, around year 50 the apostles gathered in the first Church council, the Council of Jerusalem. This council affirmed that Gentiles could become Christians without adopting all of the Mosaic Law.

The early Christian Church was not very organized. This resulted in diverse interpretations of Christian beliefs. To have more consistency, by the end of the 2nd century Christian communities had developed a more structured hierarchy. The organization of the Church began to mimic that of the Empire. The churches in Antioch, Alexandria, and Rome were the most important. To solve problems about doctrine or policy, bishops often congregated in regional synods. This happened from the beginning of the 2nd century. By the 3r century, the bishop of Rome began to be asked about problems that other bishops could not resolve. 

Influential theologians, named Church Fathers, refined the doctrine. From the year 100, some teachers such as Ignatius of Antioch and Irenaeus defined Catholic teaching. This was done by opposing them to opposed them to Gnosticism.

Theological apologists consolidated teachings and traditons. Among them we can find Pope Clement I and Augustine of Hippo.

Christianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods. This was adopted from Judaism and was different from most religions in the Roman Empire.

As Christians refuse to join pagan celebrations, they weren't able to take part in much of public life. This caused non-Christians to fear that Christians were angering the gods (this meant a threat to the peace and prosperity of the Empire).

Due to its secrecy, Christians were accused of practising incest and cannibalism.
In the 3rd century, Christians were persecuted by order of the emperors. They hold them responsible for the Empire's crises. All residents were ordered to give sacrifices or be punished. Jews were exempted as long as they paid the Jewish Tax. Estimates of the number of Christians who were executed ranges from a few hundred to 50,000. Many fled or renounced their beliefs. 

In spite of these persecutions, evangelization efforts persisted. This led to the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity in 313. By 380, Christianity had become the state religion of the Roman Empire.

When Constantine became emperor of the Western Roman Empire in 312, he attributed his victory to the Christian God. Many soldiers in his army were Christians, and his army was his base of power. With Licinius, (Eastern Roman emperor), he issued the Edict of Milan which mandated toleration of all religions in the empire. The edict had little effect on the attitudes of the people. New laws were issued to codify some Christian beliefs and practices. 

Constantine's biggest effect on Christianity was his patronage:
These gifts and later ones combined made the Church the largest landowner in the West by the 6th century.

In a reflection of their increased power in the Empire, clergy began to adopt the dress of the royal household.

During Constantine's reign, more or less half of the Christians Christian did not subscribe to the official church. Constantine feared that disunity would displease God, so he eliminated some sects. To resolve other disputes, Constantine began the practice of calling ecumenical councils. These councils determined obligatory interpretations of Church doctrine.

Decisions made at the Council of Nicea (325) about the divinity of Christ led to a schism. The new religion, Arianism flourished outside the Roman Empire. Partially to distinguish themselves from Arians, Catholic devotion to Mary became more important. This was the cause to further schisms.

In 380, mainstream Christianity (as opposed to Arianism) became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Christianity became more associated with the Empire. This was the reason why Christians living outside of the empire were persecuted, becasuse their rulers feared they would revolt in favor of the Emperor. In 385, capital punishment was first used upon a Christian 'heretic', namely Priscillian. 

During this period, the Bible as we know it today was first officially arranged in Church Councils or Synods. This was done through the process of official 'canonization'. Prior to these Councils or Synods, the Bible had already reached a form that was nearly identical to its current one:
The Council of Ephesus in 431 declared that Jesus was both fully man and fully God. Two decades later, the Council of Chalcedon solidified Roman papal primacy. This added to continuing breakdown in relations between Rome and Constantinople, the seat of the Eastern Church. The Monophysite disagreements over the precise nature of the incarnation of Jesus led to the first of the various Oriental Orthodox Churches breaking away from the Catholic Church.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, trinitarian Christianity and Arian Christianity competed for the conversion of the barbarian tribes. The 496 conversion of Clovis I, pagan king of the Franks, saw the beginning of a steady rise of the faith in the West.

In 530, Saint Benedict wrote his Rule of St Benedict as a practical guide for monastic community life. Its message spread to monasteries throughout Europe. Monasteries became major conduits of civilization. They preserved craft and artistic skills and maintained intellectual culture. They functioned as spiritual , agricultural, economic and production centers. During this period the Visigoths and Lombards moved away from Arianism for Catholicism. Pope Gregory the Great reformed the ecclesiastical structures and administration. Then, he launched renewed missionary efforts. Missionaries such as Augustine of Canterbury, who was sent to begin the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons, others took Christianity into northern Europe. They spread Catholicism among the Germanic, and Slavic peoples. The Synod of Whitby of 664 was decisive for the reintegration of the Celtic Church of the British Isles into the Roman hierarchy. And in Italy, the 728 Donation of Sutri and the 756 Donation of Pepin left the papacy in charge a sizable kingdom. The Donation of Constantine further consolidated the papal position over the western part of the former Roman Empire.

In the early 8th century, Byzantine iconoclasm became a major source of conflict between the Eastern and Western parts of the Church. Byzantine emperors prohibited the creation and veneration of religious images. They saw them as violations of the Ten Commandments. Pope Gregory III vehemently disagreed. A new Empress Irene siding with the pope, called for an Ecumenical Council. In 787, the fathers of the Second Council of Nicaea "warmly received the papal delegates and his message". At the conclusion, 300 bishops, who were led by the representatives of Pope Hadrian I "adopted the Pope's teaching", in favor of icons.

The papacy acquired a new protector in the West with the coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III in 800 and the handing over of the keys to the Tomb of Saint Peter. This freed the pontiffs from the power of the emperor in Constantinople. However, it also led to a schism, because the emperors and patriarchs of Constantinople interpreted themselves as the true descendants of the Roman Empire. Pope Nicholas I had refused to recognize Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople, who in turn had attacked the pope as a heretic. This was because he kept the filioque in the creed, which referred to the Holy Spirit emanating from God the Father and the Son. The papacy was strengthened through this new alliance, which in the long term created a new problem for the Popes. This was that, in the Investiture controversy, succeeding emperors sought to appoint bishops and even future popes. After the disintegration of the Carolingian Empire and repeated incursions of Islamic forces into Italy, the papacy, without any protection, entered a phase of major weakness.

The Cluniac reform of monasteries that began in 910 placed abbots under the direct control of the pope rather than the secular control of feudal lords. This eliminated a major source of corruption and sparked a great monastic renewal. Monasteries, convents and cathedrals still operated all schools and libraries. They also often functioned as credit establishments promoting economic growth. After 1100, some older cathedral schools were divided into:

During the 11th century, the East–West schism divided Christianity forever. It started with a dispute on whether Constantinople or Rome held jurisdiction over the church in Sicily. This led to mutual excommunications in 1054. The Western (Latin) branch of Christianity has since become known as the Catholic Church. The Eastern (Greek) branch became known as the Orthodox Church. The Second Council of Lyon (1274) and the Council of Florence (1439) both failed to heal the schism. Some Eastern churches have since reunited with the Catholic Church, and others claim never to have been out of communion with the pope. Officially, the two churches remain in schism, although excommunications were mutually lifted in 1965.

The 11th century saw the Investiture controversy between Emperor and Pope over the right to make church appointments. This was the first major phase of the struggle between Church and state in medieval Europe. The Papacy were the initial victors. However, Italians divided between Guelphs and Ghibellines in factions that lasted until the end of the Middle Ages. The dispute gradually weakened the Papacy, not least by drawing it into politics.

Pope Urban II started the First Crusade in 1095 when he received an appeal from Byzantine emperor Alexius I to help repel a Turkish invasion. Urban believed that a Crusade might help bring about reconciliation with Eastern Christianity. Encouraged by reports of Muslim atrocities against Christians, a series of military campaigns began in 1096. They were known as the Crusades. They were intended to return the Holy Land to Christian control. The goal was not permanently realized. Also, the Crusades left a legacy of mutual distrust between Muslims and Western and Eastern Christians. The sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade left Eastern Christians resentful. In 2001, Pope John Paul II apologized to the Orthodox Christians for the sins of Catholics including the sacking of Constantinople in 1204.

Two new orders of architecture emerged from the Church of this era. The earlier Romanesque style combined massive walls, rounded arches and ceilings of masonry. To compensate for the absence of large windows, interiors were painted with scenes from the Bible and the lives of the saints. Later, the Basilique Saint-Denis marked a new trend in cathedral building when it utilized Gothic architecture. In other developments, the 12th century saw the founding of eight new monastic orders. Many of them functioned as Military Knights of the Crusades. Cistercian monk Bernard of Clairvaux had great influence over the new orders and produced reforms to ensure purity of purpose. His influence led Pope Alexander III to begin reforms that would lead to the establishment of canon law. In the following century, new mendicant orders were founded by Francis of Assisi and Dominic de Guzmán which brought consecrated religious life into urban settings.

Catharism grew in Languedoc in the 12th-century. The Inquisition originated during the period of struggle against this heresy. After the Cathars were accused of murdering a papal legate in 1208, Pope Innocent III declared the Albigensian Crusade. Abuses committed during the crusade caused Innocent III to informally institute the first papal inquisition to prevent future massacres and root out the remaining Cathars. Formalized under Gregory IX, this Medieval inquisition executed an average of three people per year for heresy at its height. Over time, other inquisitions were launched by the Church or secular rulers. Its main objectives were to prosecute heretics, to respond to the threat of Moorish invasion or for political purposes. The accused were encouraged to renounce their heresy and those who did not could be punished by penance, fines, imprisonment or execution by burning.

A growing sense of church-state conflicts marked the 14th century. To escape instability in Rome, Clement V in 1309 became the first of seven popes to reside in the fortified city of Avignon in southern France. This period was known as the Avignon Papacy. The papacy returned to Rome in 1378 at the urging of Catherine of Siena and others who felt the See of Peter should be in the Roman church. With the death of Pope Gregory XI later that year, the papal election was disputed between supporters of Italian and French-backed candidates. This led to the Western Schism. For 38 years, separate claimants to the papal throne sat in Rome and Avignon. Efforts at resolution further complicated the issue when a third compromise pope was elected in 1409. The matter was finally resolved in 1417 at the Council of Constance. There, the cardinals asked all three claimants to the papal throne to resign, and held a new election naming Martin V pope.

In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, European missionaries and explorers spread Catholicism to the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania. Pope Alexander VI, in the papal bull Inter caetera, awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to Spain and Portugal. Under the patronato system, state authorities controlled clerical appointments and no direct contact was allowed with the Vatican. In December 1511, the Dominican friar Antonio de Montesinos openly rebuked the Spanish authorities governing Hispaniola for their mistreatment of the American natives, telling them "... you are in mortal sin ... for the cruelty and tyranny you use in dealing with these innocent people". King Ferdinand enacted the Laws of Burgos and Valladolid in response. Enforcement was lax, and while some blame the Church for not doing enough while others point to the Church as the only voice raised on behalf of indigenous peoples. The issue resulted in a crisis of conscience in 16th-century Spain.

In 1521, through the leadership and preaching of the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, the first Catholics were baptized in what became the first Christian nation in Southeast Asia, the Philippines. The following year, Franciscan missionaries arrived in what is now Mexico, and sought to convert the Indians and to provide for their well-being by establishing schools and hospitals. They taught the Indians better farming methods, and easier ways of weaving and making pottery. Because some people questioned whether the Indians were truly human and deserved baptism, Pope Paul III in the papal bull Veritas Ipsa or Sublimis Deus (1537) confirmed that the Indians were deserving people. Afterward, the conversion effort gained momentum. Over the next 150 years, the missions expanded into southwestern North America. In India, Portuguese missionaries and the Spanish Jesuit Francis Xavier evangelized among non-Christians and a Christian community which claimed to have been established by Thomas the Apostle.

In Europe, the Renaissance marked a period of renewed interest in ancient and classical learning. It also brought a re-examination of accepted beliefs. Cathedrals and churches had long served as picture books and art galleries for millions of the uneducated. The Church sponsored great Renaissance artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Although Church leaders were able to promote Renaissance humanism, there were also conflicts between clerics and humanists. In 1509, a well known scholar of the age, Erasmus, wrote The Praise of Folly, a work which captured a widely held unease about corruption in the Church. The Papacy itself was questioned by conciliarism expressed in the councils of Constance and the Basel. Real reforms during these ecumenical councils and the Fifth Lateran Council were attempted several times but prevented. They were seen as necessary but did not succeed in large measure because of internal feuds, ongoing conflicts with the Ottoman Empire and Saracenes and the simony and nepotism practiced in the Renaissance Church of the 15th and early 16th centuries. As a result, rich, powerful and worldly men like Roderigo Borgia (Pope Alexander VI) were able to win election to the papacy.

The Fifth Lateran Council issued some but only minor reforms in March 1517. A few months later, on 31 October 1517, Martin Luther posted his Ninety-Five Theses in public, hoping to spark debate. His theses protested key points of Catholic doctrine as well as the sale of indulgences. Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, and others also criticized Catholic teachings. These challenges, supported by powerful political forces in the region, developed into the Protestant Reformation. During this era, many people emigrated from their homes to areas which tolerated or practiced their faith.

In Germany, the Reformation led to war between the Protestant Schmalkaldic League and the Catholic Emperor Charles V. The first nine-year war ended in 1555 . However, continued tensions produced a far graver conflict, the Thirty Years' War, which broke out in 1618. In the Netherlands, the wars of the Counter-Reformation were the Dutch Revolt and the Eighty Years' War. 

In France, a series of conflicts termed the French Wars of Religion was fought from 1562 to 1598 between the Huguenots and the forces of the French Catholic League. A series of popes sided with and became financial supporters of the Catholic League. This ended under Pope Clement VIII, who hesitantly accepted King Henry IV's 1598 Edict of Nantes, which granted civil and religious toleration to Protestants. In 1565, several hundred Huguenot shipwreck survivors surrendered to the Spanish in Florida, believing they would be treated well. Although a Catholic minority in their party was spared, all of the rest were executed for heresy, with active clerical participation.

The English Reformation was based on Henry VIII's desire for annulment of his marriage with Catherine of Aragon. It was initially more of a political, and later a theological dispute. The Acts of Supremacy made the English monarch head of the English church thereby establishing the Church of England. Then, beginning in 1536, some 825 monasteries throughout England, Wales and Ireland were dissolved and Catholic churches were confiscated.When he died in 1547 all monasteries, friaries, convents of nuns and shrines were destroyed or dissolved. Mary I of England reunited the Church of England with Rome and persecuted Protestants during the Marian Persecutions. After some provocation, the following monarch, Elizabeth I enforced the Act of Supremacy. This prevented Catholics from becoming members of professions, holding public office, voting or educating their children. Executions of Catholics and dissenting Protestants under Elizabeth I, who reigned much longer, then surpassed the Marian persecutions and persisted under the following English monarchs. Elizabeth I also executed other Penal laws were also enacted in Ireland but were less effective than in England. In part because the Irish people associated Catholicism with nationhood and national identity, they resisted persistent English efforts to eliminate the Catholic Church.

The Council of Trent (1545–1563) became the driving-force of the Counter-Reformation, and reaffirmed central Catholic doctrines such as transubstantiation, and the need for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation. It also reformed many other areas of importance to the Church. It did so by improving the education of the clergy and consolidating the central jurisdiction of the Roman Curia.

The criticisms of the Reformation were among factors that sparked new religious orders including the Jesuits, which became the great missionary order of later years. Spiritual renewal and reform were inspired by many new saints like Teresa of Avila, Francis de Sales and Philip Neri. Their writings spawned distinct schools of spirituality within the Church (Oratorians, Carmelites, Salesian), etc. Improvement to the education of the laity was another positive effect of the era. To popularize Counter-Reformation teachings, the Church encouraged the Baroque style. Baroque religious expression was stirring and emotional, created to stimulate religious fervor.

Elsewhere, Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier introduced the Catholic Church in Japan. Church growth came to a halt in 1597 under the Shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi who, in an effort to isolate the country from foreign influences, launched a severe persecution of Christians. Japanese were forbidden to leave the country and Europeans were forbidden to enter. Despite this, a minority Christian population survived into the 19th century when Japan opened more to outside influence, and they continue to the present day.

The Council of Trent generated a revival of religious life and Marian devotions in the Catholic Church. During the Reformation, the Church had defended its Marian beliefs against Protestant views. 

Pope Paul V and Gregory XV ruled in 1617 and 1622 to be inadmissible to state, that the virgin was conceived non-immaculate. Supporting the belief that the virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception was preserved free from all stain of original sin (aka Immaculate Conception) Alexander VII declared in 1661, that the soul of Mary was free from original sin. Pope Clement XI ordered the feast of the Immaculata for the whole Church in 1708. The feast of the Rosary was introduced in 1716, the feast of the Seven Sorrows in 1727. The Angelus prayer was strongly supported by Pope Benedict XIII in 1724 and by Pope Benedict XIV in 1742. Popular Marian piety was even more colourful and varied than ever before: Numerous Marian pilgrimages, Marian Salve devotions, new Marian litanies, Marian theatre plays, Marian hymns, Marian processions. Marian fraternities, today mostly defunct, had millions of members.

The Enlightenment constituted a new challenge of the Church. Unlike the Protestant Reformation, the enlightenment questioned Christianity as a whole. Generally, it elevated human reason above divine revelation. It also and down-graded religious authorities such as the papacy based on it.

Toward the latter part of the 17th century, Pope Innocent XI saw increasing Turkish attacks against Europe as a threat for the Church. He built a Polish-Austrian coalition for the Turkish defeat at Vienna in 1683. Innocent X and Clement XI fought against Jansenism and Gallicanism. Both supported Conciliarism, and rejected papal primacy. This weakened the Church's ability to respond to gallicanist thinkers such as Denis Diderot, who challenged fundamental doctrines of the Church.

In 1685 gallicanist King Louis XIV of France issued the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, ending a century of religious toleration. France forced Catholic theologians to support conciliarism and deny Papal infallibility. The king threatened Pope Innocent XI with a general council and a military take-over of the Papal state. The absolute French State used Gallicanism to gain control of virtually all major Church appointments as well as many of the Church's properties. State authority over the Church became popular in other countries as well. In Belgium and Germany, Gallicanism appeared in the form of Febronianism. Emperor Joseph II of Austria (1780–1790) practiced Josephinism. He regulated Church life, appointments, and massive confiscation of Church properties. The 18th century is also the time of the Catholic Enlightenment, a multi-faceted reform movement.

The anti-clericalism of the French Revolution promoted the nationalisation of church property and attempts to establish a state-run church. Large numbers of priests refused to take an oath of compliance to the National Assembly, leading to the Church being outlawed and replaced by a new religion of the worship of "Reason" but it never gained popularity. In this period, all monasteries were destroyed, 30,000 priests were exiled and hundreds more were killed. When Pope Pius VI sided against the revolution in the First Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Italy. The 82-year-old pope was taken as a prisoner to France in February 1798 and soon died. To win popular support for his rule, Napoleon re-established the Catholic Church in France through the Concordat of 1801. The church lands were never returned, however the priests and other religious were given salaries by the government, which maintained church properties through tax revenues. Catholics were allowed to continue some of their schools. The end of the Napoleonic wars, signaled by the Congress of Vienna, brought Catholic revival and the return of the Papal States to the pope; the Jesuits were restored.

France remained basically Catholic. The Revolution failed to destroy the Catholic Church, and Napoleon's concordat of 1801 restored its status. The return of the Bourbons in 1814 brought back many rich nobles and landowners who supported the Church. However, few new priests were trained in the 1790–1814 period, and many left the church. The result was that the number of parish clergy plunged from 60,000 in 1790 to 25,000 in 1815, many of them elderly. Entire regions, especially around Paris, were left with few priests. On the other hand, some traditional regions held fast to the faith, led by local nobles and historic families. The comeback was slow—very slow in the larger cities and industrial areas. With systematic missionary work and support from Napoleon III, there was a comeback. Conservative Catholics held control of the national government, 1820–1830. However, most often played secondary political roles or had to fight the assault from republicans, liberals, socialists and seculars.

Throughout the lifetime of the Third Republic there were battles over the status of the Catholic Church. The French clergy and bishops were linked to the Monarchists. Republicans were based in the anticlerical middle class who saw the Church as a political threat to republicanism and progress. The Republicans detested the church for its political and class affiliations; for them, the church represented outmoded traditions, superstition and monarchism. The Republicans were strengthened by Protestant and Jewish support. Numerous laws were passed to weaken the Catholic Church. Napoleon's 1801 Concordat continued in operation but in 1881, the government cut off salaries to priests it disliked.

The 1882 school laws of Republican Jules Ferry set up a national system of public schools that taught strict puritanical morality but no religion. For a while privately funded Catholic schools were tolerated. Civil marriage became compulsory, divorce was introduced and chaplains were removed from the army.

When Leo XIII became pope in 1878 he tried to calm Church-State relations. In 1884 he told French bishops not to act in a hostile manner to the State. In 1892 he issued an encyclical advising French Catholics to rally to the Republic and defend the Church by participating in Republican politics. This attempt at improving the relationship failed. Deep-rooted suspicions remained on both sides and were inflamed by the Dreyfus Affair. Catholics were for the most part anti-dreyfusard. The Assumptionists published anti-Semitic and anti-republican articles in their journal La Croix. This infuriated Republican politicians, who were eager to take revenge. Often they worked in alliance with Masonic lodges. The Waldeck-Rousseau Ministry (1899–1902) and the Combes Ministry (1902–05) fought with the Vatican over the appointment of bishops. Chaplains were removed from naval and military hospitals (1903–04), and soldiers were ordered not to frequent Catholic clubs (1904). Combes as Prime Minister in 1902, was determined to thoroughly defeat Catholicism. He closed down all parochial schools in France. Then he had parliament reject authorisation of all religious orders. This meant that all fifty four orders were dissolved and about 20,000 members immediately left France, many for Spain.[190] In 1905 the 1801 Concordat was abrogated; Church and State were finally separated. All Church property was confiscated. Public worship was given over to associations of Catholic laymen who controlled access to churches. In practise, Masses and rituals continued. The Church was badly hurt and lost half its priests. In the long run, however, it gained autonomy—for the State no longer had a voice in choosing bishops and Gallicanism was dead.

Before the council, in 1854 Pope Pius IX proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. The majority of Catholic Bishops supported this decision. Eight years earlier, in 1846, the Pope declared the Immaculata the patron of the USA.

During First Vatican Council, some 108 council fathers requested to add the words "Immaculate Virgin" to the Hail Mary. Some fathers asked to includethe dogma of the Immaculate Conception in the Creed of the Church. This was opposed by Pius IX. It was also strongly opposed by some council fathers, especially from Germany. Many French Catholics wished that the Council declared Papal infallibility and the assumption of Mary dogma. In 1870, the First Vatican Council affirmed the doctrine of papal infallibility. Controversy over this and other issues resulted in a very small breakaway movement called the Old Catholic Church.

The Industrial Revolution brought many concerns about the deteriorating conditions of urban workers. In 1891 Pope Leo XIII published the encyclical Rerum novarum. It was set in context Catholic social teaching: it rejected socialism but advocated the regulation of working conditions. Rerum novarum argued for the establishment of a living wage and the right of workers to form trade unions.

Quadragesimo anno was issued by Pope Pius XI, on 15 May 1931, 40 years after Rerum novarum. Unlike Leo, who addressed mainly the condition of workers, Pius XI concentrated on the ethical implications of the social and economic order. He called for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. He noted major dangers for human freedom and dignity, arising from unrestrained capitalism and totalitarian communism.

The social teachings of Pope Pius XII repeat these teachings. He applies them not only to workers and owners of capital, but also to other professions and all aspects of life. Going beyond Pius XI, he also defined social teachings in other areas such as medicine, psychology, sport, television, science, law and education. The dominant concern was the continued rights and dignity of the individual. With the beginning of the space age at the end of his pontificate, Pius XII explored the social implications of space exploration and satellites asking for a new sense of community and solidarity.

Popes have always highlighted the link between the Virgin Mary as Mother of God and the full acceptance of Jesus Christ as Son of God. Since the 19th century, they were very important for the development of mariology to explain the veneration of Mary. Before the 19th century, Popes promulgated Marian veneration in different ways such as authorizing new Marian feast days, prayers, initiatives, the acceptance and support of Marian congregations. Since the 19th century, Popes begin to use encyclicals more frequently. Thus Leo XIII, the Rosary Pope issued eleven Marian encyclicals. Recent Popes promulgated the veneration of the Blessed Virgin with two dogmas:

Pius XII also promulgated the new feast Queenship of Mary celebrating Mary as Queen of Heaven and he introduced the first ever Marian year in 1954, a second one was proclaimed by John Paul II. Pius IX, Pius XI and Pius XII facilitated the veneration of Marian apparitions such as in Lourdes and Fátima. Later Popes such from John XXIII to Benedict XVI promoted the visit to Marian shrines (Benedict XVI in 2007 and 2008). The Second Vatican Council highlighted the importance of Marian veneration in Lumen gentium. During the Council, Paul VI proclaimed Mary to be the Mother of the Church.

The 20th century saw the rise of various politically radical and anti-clerical governments. The 1926 Calles Law separating church and state in Mexico led to the Cristero War. In it, over 3,000 priests were exiled or assassinated, churches desecrated, services mocked, nuns raped and captured priests shot. In the Soviet Union following the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, persecution of the Church and Catholics continued well into the 1930s. In addition to the execution and exiling of clerics, monks and laymen, the confiscation of religious implements and closure of churches was common. During the 1936–39 Spanish Civil War, the Catholic hierarchy supported Francisco Franco's rebel Nationalist forces against the Popular Front government. This was due to the Republican violence directed against the Church.

After the Second World War began in September 1939, the Church condemned the invasion of Poland and the following 1940 Nazi invasions. In the Holocaust, Pope Pius XII directed the Church hierarchy to help protect Jews and Gypsies from the Nazis. While Pius XII has been credited with helping to save hundreds of thousands of Jews, the Church has also been accused of antisemitism. Other commentators have accused Pius of not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities. Debate over the validity of these criticisms continues to this day.

The Catholic Church started a reformation process after the Second Vatican Council (1962–65). Intended as a continuation of Vatican I, under Pope John XXIII the council developed into an engine of modernisation. Its main task was double:

Other reforms decided at the Second Vatican Council were:

In June 2004, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I's visited Rome. This happened on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul (29 June). Its scope was another personal meeting with Pope John Paul II, for conversations with the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity.

The Patriarch's partial participation in the Eucharistic liturgy followed the program of the past visits of Patriarch Dimitrios (1987) and Patriarch Bartholomew I himself:
The Patriarch did not fully participate in the Liturgy of the Eucharist involving the consecration and distribution of the Eucharist itself.

In accordance with the Catholic Church's practice of including the Filioque clause when reciting the Creed in Latin, but not when reciting the Creed in Greek, Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI have recited the Nicene Creed jointly with Patriarchs Demetrius I and Bartholomew I in Greek without the Filioque clause.

The declaration of Ravenna in 2007 re-asserted these beliefs, and re-stated the notion that the bishop of Rome is indeed the protos, although future discussions are to be held on the concrete ecclesiological exercise of papal primacy.

With the election of Pope Benedict XVI in 2005, the Church largely saw a continuation of the policies of his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. However, there were some notable exceptions: Benedict decentralized beatifications and reverted the decision of his predecessor regarding papal elections. In 2007, he set a Church record by approving the beatification of 498 Spanish Martyrs. His first encyclical Deus caritas est discussed love and sex in continued opposition to several other views on sexuality. 

Following the resignation of Benedict, Pope Francis was elected pope 2013. He is the current and first Jesuit pope, the first pope from the Americas, and the first from the Southern Hemisphere. Since his election to the papacy, he has displayed a simpler and less formal approach to the office, choosing to reside in the Vatican guesthouse rather than the papal residence.

Glass ceiling

A glass ceiling is an idea that people use to talk about why some people do not get promotions in companies, schools, and other groups. A company has a glass ceiling if it "looks" as if women and minorities could become leaders but they never really do. That is called a glass ceiling because a new employee starting at the bottom (the "ground floor"), can see all the way up to the top of the building (leadership), but really there is a barrier in the way.

The metaphor was first made by feminists to talk about why it is harder for high-achieving women to get promotions than men. In the US, the concept is sometimes used to refer to minorities based not on gender. Women of color in countries whose population is mostly white people often find the most difficulty in "breaking the glass ceiling" because they are both women and people of color, two types of people who were not liked in the past. East Asian and East Asian American news outlets have made a used a metaphor taken from the original, the term "bamboo ceiling". It tries to show white people not liking East Asians, as bamboo is from Asia.

Within the same ideas of the other terms surrounding the workplace, there are similar terms about extra rules about women and their roles within organisations and how they manage their jobs as mothers. These "Invisible Barriers" work as metaphors to describe the many extra things stopping women, usually when trying to become better in their career and usually while also trying to make their other parts of life better.

"A glass ceiling" represents something stopping women from getting high ranks in a company where people have different amounts of power, usually shown on a pyramid diagram. Those women are not allowed to get promotion, especially to the very high rankings, inside their jobs. Since 2001, the women working who do not work in the health and educational sector have not been seen in the high ranks a lot.

Nikah mut'ah

In Twelverism, Nikah mut'ah is a form of marriage. It is also called Sigheh. Unlike Nikāḥ, which is the other form of marriage in Islamic law, a Nikah mut'ah marriage does not last for the two people's whole lives. It lasts only limited time. Nikah mutah is about sexual pleasure. Followers of Twelver Shia Islam believe that Nikah mut'ah is legal, but most other Muslims disagree on this belief. 

Some things must be true for a Nikah mut'ah:

Nikah mut'ah is different from the other form of marriage in other ways too:

Nikah mut'ah does not have to be publicly announced. Islam says that Muslim men may have only four and no more, but this only applies to Nikah-marriages.

According to Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the Nikah mut'ah is the only way a Muslim can marry a person of the Book who is not Muslim. He says Nikah is not possible with non-Muslims. Other Ayatollahs say that Muslims can marry non-Muslim people of the book.

Nikah mut'ah has been used to cover child prostitution. Some Western writers have argued that mut'ah is similar to prostitution. Julie Parshall writes that mut'ah is legalised prostitution allowed by the Twelver Shia authorities. She quotes the Oxford encyclopedia of modern Islamic world to make a difference between marriage (nikah) and mut'ah. She also says that while nikah is for having children, mut'ah is just for sexual gratification.

Chestnut flour

Chestnut flour, also called sweet flour, is a flour made by grinding chestnuts.

It has a hazelnut-like color and a sweet flavour. It is mainly made in Italian mountain regions, which is between 450 to 900 meters above sea level, where the sweet chestnut can be found. In the past, it was a important source for the regions as it is high in energy.

The chestnut in the time of San Benedetto was intensively cultivated due to famines and the plague in Tuscany in the 1300s that led the population to move in for finding support at the hills.

In Corsica, chestnut trees were introduced in the 16th century by the Genoese, and their spread had changed the culture of the island including its food.

Uyghur genocide

The Repression of Uyghurs in China (sometimes called the Uyghur Genocide) is all the human rights violations in Xinjiang that are hurting Uyghurs. This is being done by the Chinese government. It is estimated that there are more than a million Uyghurs being persecuted. Some governments and human rights NGOs (organisations that aren't governments) call the repression against Uyghurs a genocide (destroying a group of people). Not everybody agrees that the repression is a genocide though.

The Uyghurs

Thousands of mosques are being destroyed and damaged. Hundreds of thousands of children are being sent to boarding schools.

Daughters of the Polo God

Daughters of the Polo God is a 2018 Indian documentary movie. It is in two languages: Meitei and English. Roopa Baruah directed it. Hemanti Sarkar edited it. The story is about saving the endangered Meitei horse (Manipuri pony) and empowering women in the sport of polo () at the same time.

The movie is about Manipuri women in polo sports. In India, polo is mostly played by men. It also shows the way they work with their Meitei horses (Manipuri ponies). The players in the documentary work very hard so they can go to the annual polo tournament.

The movie begins with Sagol Kangjei (), the ancient form of polo in Antique Kangleipak (Ancient Manipur). It was a war game. That means the sport was placed during peacetime so warriors could practice their war skills. It ended up with the present day advancements of the Manipur Horse Riding and Polo Association. It creates a cultural, ecological, historical and social relationship between the sport, the horses, and the ethnic groups of humans who live in that part of the world.

The polo started in the far corner of the North East India (Ancient Manipur). It has been developed there for many centuries. At the same time, Women's empowerment has been very active in the history of Manipur. Roopa Barua, the maker of the "Daughters of the Polo God", took interest in these facts. So, she set her project on it. She said, 

"A young polo sisterhood is developing in Manipur that ploughs on in spite of adversity and political turmoil. They are intensely connected to their sacred Manipuri pony and play an international tournament every year. My film is a tribute to these polo players, the modern Manipuri women and the pony campaign."

She spoke to the media that Manipuri girls are empowered a lot and have been able to play and do well for themselves. Before the beginning of the journey, the polo girls offered prayers to Marjing, the ""Polo God"" of Meitei religion, at his temple. And so, the name of the movie is also taken from the sense that the polo player girls are the daughters of their beloved father like Polo God of their own ethnic religion. Notably, it took over four years to complete the making of the movie.

The movie gets 6 international awards at 5 International Film Festivals. These are held at different countries of the world.
The Equus Festival takes its winning films on a film tour across North American and European countries. The "Daughters of the Polo God" was also one of the winners. So, it was also shown in the different places. These are:
The movie received official entries in many international film festivals. These are organised across the world. These include:

Pithecopus ayeaye

The reticulate leaf frog ("Pithecopus ayeaye") is a frog that lives in Brazil.

The adult male frog is 35 to 42.6 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 41.3 to 46.1 mm long. The frog has green skin with big orange blotches with dark blue or purple around them. The frog gets its name from this "reticulated" pattern on its skin. This frog has no webbing on any of its four feet, and the climbing disks on its toes are very small.

This frog lives in small rivers and pools where the water is deep.

When it is time to lay eggs, the frog finds a branch hanging over a pool of water. It builds a nest out of leaves on the branch. It lays eggs in the folded leaves. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall out of the nest into the water.

Many of the places where this frog lives are protected parks, but it is still endangered. 

This frog is endangered because humans change the places it lives into farms and mines and other things, because humans build roads through places the frog lives so that it can't travel from place to place, because of pollution, and because humans use chemicals meant to kill pests and chemicals meant to make crops grow, and these hurt the frog.

Number field

A number field is a finite degree field extension of the field formula_1 of rational numbers. 

The study of algebraic number fields, and, more generally, of algebraic extensions of the field of rational numbers, is the central topic of .

Field extension

A field extension formula_1 is a field containing a given field formula_2 as a subfield. 

The notation formula_3 means that formula_1 is an extension of the field formula_2.

formula_1 is sometimes called an overfield of the field formula_2.

An element of the field formula_1 is called algebraic over formula_2 if it satisfies some algebraic equation with coefficients in formula_2, and transcendental otherwise.

Subfield

If a subset formula_1 has elements from a field formula_2 that satisfies the same field axioms with the same operations, then formula_1 is called a subfield of formula_2.

Field axioms

Field axioms are the rules a field satisfies.

Commutativity of addition

The commutative property of addition is the property in mathematics which states that changing the order of addends does not change the sum. 

For example, formula_1.

L-functions and modular forms database

L-functions and modular forms database is an extensive database of mathematical objects arising in number theory.

It can be used for searching modular forms, elliptic curves, number fields (and fields), L-functions...

The first conference on the LMFDB, Computation, and Number Theory (LuCaNT) is currently being planned for July 10 to July 14, 2023 at ICERM in Providence, Rhode Island, United States.

Subgroup

In group theory, a branch of mathematics, given a group formula_1 under a binary operation, a subset formula_2 of formula_1 is called a subgroup of "formula_1" if the elements "formula_2" also forms a group under the binary operation.

The situation could arise in which the subset formula_2 does not comply with the binary operation.

Normal subgroup

In group theory, a branch of mathematics, a subgroup formula_1 of the group formula_2 is normal in formula_2 if and only if formula_4 for all formula_5 and formula_6.

The usual notation for this relation is formula_7

Jenga

Jenga is a block building game created by board game creator Leslie Scott, and owned by Hasbro in terms of marketing. Most of its games are now owned by Art's Ideas. In this game, players take turns removing blocks from a 54 built tower and replacing them at the top without making the tower fall.

Players must place all 54 blocks to make a tower. Players must then take turns removing blocks from the tower and putting it at the top of the tower. The game ends when the tower falls.


Interlingue grammar

Interlingue is a constructed language. It was called "Occidental" between 1922 and 1947. Edgar de Wahl, one of the first Esperantists, created it. De Wahl was from the city of Tallinn in Estonia, which was in the Russian Empire but later became its own country. He spoke German, Russian, Estonian and French since he was a child and had natural ability in languages. He is often called "de Wahl".

Interlingue looks a lot like languages in the Romance language family: French, Spanish, Italian, and so on. De Wahl made a rule called De Wahl's rule that made changing verbs to nouns easier and more regular. For example, the word exploder (to explode) regularly changes its d to s (making explosion) when following this rule.

Interlingue is written with 26 Latin letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. The letters of the alphabet are pronounced as "a, be, ce, de, e, ef, ge, ha, i, jot, ka, el, em, en, o, pe, qu, er, es, te, u, ve, duplic ve, ix, ypsilon", and "zet". Accents are written on the five vowels to indicate irregular stress, with the acute accent (á é í ó ú) preferred, but others (è, ê, etc.) permitted.

The vowels are usually pronounced as follows:

The consonants are pronounced as in English, with the following exceptions:

Other doubled consonants are pronounced as a single consonant, unless when separated they would be pronounced differently. Ex. grammatica is pronounced as if written gramatica, but occidental and suggestion are pronounced as if written as oc followed by cidental, and sug followed by gestion.

Like English, Interlingue has a definite article and an indefinite article. The definite article (the) is "li", and the indefinite (a, an) is "un". Plural of a noun is made by adding "-s" after a vowel, or "-es" after most consonants. To avoid pronunciation and stress changes, words ending in -c, -g, and -m only add an -s: un libre, du libres, un angul, tri angules, li tric, li trics, li plug, li plugs, li album, pluri albums, li tram, du trams.

The ending of the definite article can be modified to lo (masculine), la (feminine), lu (neuter), lis (plural), los (masculine plural), e las (feminine plural). Of these, the forms lu and lis are most common: lu in the same sense as Spanish "lo" and English "that which", as in Ne li aprension de un lingue es lu essential, ma su usation ("that which" is essential is not the learning of a language, but using it), and lis to change to plural words that are difficult to make plural on their own: lis s (the s's).

Interlingue has two forms for the personal pronouns: one for the subject form (nominative), and one for the object form (accusative or dative).
Grammatical endings are used, but less than in Esperanto and Ido in which parts of speech are marked with obligatory endings. Only a few parts of speech (such as verb infinitives) in Interlingue have entirely obligatory endings, while many others either have endings the usage of which is optional and sometimes recommended. Some grammatical endings are:

Notes on the correlatives:

Alcun (some) and necun (no, none) are respectively the adjectives of alquel and nequel.

The -qui series has optional accusative forms ending in -em: quem, alquem, nequem.

The -al series is adverbialized with the -men ending: qualmen (how) talmen (that way).

Correlatives can take the plural ending: queles, quales, tis, omnis, etc.

Ci (here) and ta (there) can be affixed to ti and to to indicate proximity or distance: ti libre (this book), ti-ci libre (this book here), ti-ta libre (that book there), tis (these), tis-ci (these here), tis-ta (those there), to-ci (this here), to-ta (that there).

Many derivatives are formed from the correlatives: qualitá from qual + itá, quantitá from quant + -itá, omnipotent from omni + potent.

Verbs in Interlingue have three endings: -ar, -er, and -ir. Conjugation is performed with a combination of endings and auxiliary verbs. The verb esser (to be) is exceptional in being written es in the present tense, though the esse form is seen in the imperative.

Interlingue has primary adverbs and derived adverbs. Primary adverbs are adverbs without special endings: "tre" (very), "sempre" (always), etc.

Derived adverbs are adverbs made by putting -men at the end of an adjective (rapid = quick, rapidmen = quickly). This is similar to "-ment" in French, "-mente" in Italian, and other Romance languages. The ending "-men" was inspired by Provençal and spoken French (which does not pronounce the t in "-ment") and chosen over "-mente" to avoid clashing with the noun ending "-ment" and other nouns in the language derived from the past tense in -t. The ending may be omitted when the meaning is clear: tu deve far it rapid(men) = you must do it quick(ly).

Dr. F. Haas in 1956 grouped the most common adverbs by type as below.

Red-necked avocet

The red-necked avocet ("Recurvirostra novaehollandiae") is a bird in the family Recurvirostridae. It lives in many parts of Australia, not far from the coast. It also lived in New Zealand in the 1800s, but people have not seen it there for a long time.

This bird has a red-brown head and neck. The rest of its body has white feathers except for the bars on the wings and two stripes on the back. Unlike many other shorebirds, this bird's bill curves upward instead of curving downward or being straight. Its legs are long and blue-gray. When the red-necked avocet flies, it sticks its legs out behind it instead of tucking them under its body.

Red-necked avocets spend time in the same places as the pied stilt and banded stilt. For example, they may all look for food in the same place at the same time.

This bird wades or swims in shallow water. It catches food by moving its bill side to side in the water. It eats animals without spines or bones. It also eats seeds.

This bird lays eggs when there is enough rainfall. Australia does not have the same seasons as other parts of the world, so sometimes the birds go years in between groups of eggs.

Large numbers of birds make nests near each other in a colony. The nests are small holes dug into the ground.

Meira Paibi

The Meira Paibi () are traditional women's social organisations and their movements in Manipur. Meira Paibi work against many different social evils. For example, they work against the cruelty of the Indian Army and the military in Manipur, India. They are called the ""Guardians of the society"". The name comes from the burning torches that the women carry. The torch has become the symbol of peaceful protest for justice at all levels of life.

The meira paibi is the largest basic level, weaponless movement fighting with the state's inhumanity and human rights violations in Manipur. The women have always faced the strength of the armed forces with nothing other than their unity and will power for many decades.

Sometimes the military will arrest a man even though they do not have proof or a good cause. These women's organisations stop these arrests. Generally, the meira paibi groups form in Imphal and other places in the valley of Manipur. The women patrol the streets, mainly at night time. They often constitute a large, unified and disciplined group at public gatherings, especially for protests.

Today, every place where Meitei people live has meira paibi organisations. They did this to save Manipur from being a land of victims and unhappiness. The meira paibis also changed drug abuse patterns.

The Meitei women started the meira paibi movement in the 1970s in Manipur, India. They stood against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). Besides, they were also fighting against crimes against women and drugs abuse. 
In 1980, the entire Manipur state was brought under the AFSPA to conflicting rebellions. Many innocent young men were often arrested, tortured and killed. At this, the women demanded the removal of the act. Along with this, the group of women patrolled the streets to stop improper search operations by the security forces. Simultaneously, the women became the ""Wall protecting society against violence and killings"".

In July, 2004, the meira paibi protests hit the global headlines when the 12 Meitei Manipuri women stood without clothes in front of the Kangla Fort. It was where the Assam Rifles (a unit of Indian Army) were stationed. There, they protested naked, carrying a banner that reads ""Indian Army Rape Us."" They were protesting against the rape, torture and custodial killing of Thangjam Manorama, a young woman, by the Assam Rifles troops.

The meira paibis and the Meitei women should be the role model to every women to know their responsibilities and contributions in social welfare. After knowing this, the UNICEF says: 
"The Manipuri story indicates that active participation by women in public affairs can and does contribute to better conditions for children and society at large."

In 2013, The Times of India awarded the ""TOI Social Impact Awards: Lifetime Contribution"" to the meira paibis of Manipur.

Fireflies (movie)

Fireflies is a 2018 Indian Meitei language documentary short movie. It was directed by Johnson Rajkumar. It is about the struggles of the Meira Paibis to protect the people from crimes in Manipur state. It also shows the role of women in the conflicting and male-dominated society of Manipur. It looks at how the gender gap and gender identities are settled during times of conflict and violence in the society.

The movie shows women reacting to the rising cases of disappearance of men. This took place after the was applied to Manipur state. The important point of the movie is that women stand up for the safety, security and better survival of the men.

In 1980s, when Manipur was exposed to revolutionaries and armed violence, a group of women came out to the streets to uphold peace in the state. These groups were called the Meira Paibis. They were the freely independent women's organisations. They participated in the willing patrols during the night. They held the flaming torches and tried to bring balance in the society.

In India, women are mostly seen to be confined in their homes. In reality, they are the important members of every social movement. But they are always seen as not related. Women of Manipur contributed a lot towards the welfare of the social conditions. This really inspired Johnson Rajkumar, the maker of the "Fireflies". 

He tried to show the influence of gender roles in conflicts and violence. If men were holding such responsibilities, they would have been falsely grouped into rebels. According to Johnson, the movie shows that women's collective has more to do beyond pro-feminists. 

Rajkumar went to Bangalore for higher education. There, he realised that the issues from Manipur and the North East India were not truly represented or interpreted in the national media news. Hence, he created the "Fireflies" to fight the set false stories. He wanted to show the best formal true facts.

The movie is financially supported by the "Samaj Pragati Sahayog", a social media platform based in Madhya Pradesh, India. Additionally, it is supported by the Film Division of India. 

Rajkumar is the director of the movie and a Manipuri media activist. He lives in Bangalore, Karnataka. He has been making documentary movies on social and political issues. He focuses on social movements and protests.

The movie won many awards in international film festivals. These were held in different countries of the world.

Kingdom of Aragon

The Kingdom of Aragon (, , , ) was one of the Hispanic kingdoms of the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula. It was in the central Pyrenean region in 1035 after the union of the Carolingian counties of Aragon, Sobrarbe and Ribagorza. It expanded southward, as it took over Muslim territories, until it came to occupy the area corresponding to the current autonomous community of Aragon.

Not to be confused with the Crown of Aragon, a group of territories over which the King of Aragon ruled. At first it consisted of the Kingdom of Aragon itself plus the possessions of the Count of Barcelona, and later the Kingdom of Mallorca, the Kingdom of Valencia, and several territories in the Mediterranean were added by conquest. Although it was never considered a kingdom, Catalonia was one of the territories that made up the Crown, and since it had a large population and military weight, it was considered one of the "kingdoms" of the Crown of Aragon.

In 1479 the union of the Crowns of Aragon and Castile took place. However, unlike the Crown of Castile, the Crown of Aragon continued to function. The territories shared the same monarch but had different laws, institutions and ways of relating to the king until 1707. Then in the context of the War of the Spanish Succession, King Philip V, first king of the House of Bourbon, abolished its laws, abolished the Council of Aragon and the rest of its own institutions, such as the Justice, the Provincial Council or the Courts of Aragon, and imposed the laws and institutions of the Crown of Castile, through the Decrees of Nueva Planta.

Aragon would continue to be considered a territorial division of Spain until 1833, when Javier de Burgos established the territorial division by provinces, ending the division by kingdoms. The other territories of the former crown of Aragon also saw their institutions and laws abolished after the various Nueva Planta Decrees: the courts of the principality of Catalonia, the kingdom of Valencia and the kingdom of Mallorca, like those of Aragon, were from then on convened jointly with the Cortes of Castile.

The marriage of Andregoto, daughter of Count Galindo II of Aragon, to King Garcia Sanchez I of Navarre, led to the union with Navarre. 

In 1035 Ramiro, natural son of Sancho III of Navarre and baiulus of the county of Aragon, incorporated the counties of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza, which had been under the rule of his brother Gonzalo, into the county. After Sancho's death, the county split from the kingdom of Navarre and was a separate kingdom. Limited to the Pyrenean valleys and neighbouring the more powerful kingdom of Navarre and the important Taifa of Saragossa, the increase in population and the thirst for land for its inhabitants made it expand, despite its initial military weakness.

The legitimacy of the new dynasty was achieved by the kings Sancho Ramírez and Pedro I by placing the kingdom under the protection of the Holy See. Thus the Kingdom of Aragon became part of the western states. The donation of the kingdom to the pope was made by Sancho Ramirez in 1068, in an attempt to strengthen his position against his hostile neighbors, sometimes allied against him.

The king of Navarre Sancho Garcés IV was assassinated by his own brother in 1076. The Navarrese elected Sancho Ramirez of Aragon - cousin of the deceased- as their king, who incorporated the crown of Pamplona to that of Aragon. The kingdom of Navarre was divided between León-Castile and Aragon. Aragon got the main territories, including the capital of Navarre in exchange for admitting the theoretical supremacy of Castile-León. To celebrate the expansion, Sancho founded the city of Jaca, where he lived and to which he transferred the Mozarabic bishopric of Huesca in 1077. As he controlled the highlands bordering the Ebro to the north, he was able to undertake various raids, mainly against the Zaragozan taifa, and try to expand into the plain, mainly along the valleys of Aragon, Sobrarbe and Ribagorza. To compensate for the lack of soldiers needed for territorial expansion, he tried to bring them from the south of France. Expansion, however, was slow and was carried out especially through the conquest of strategic points, such as Graus in 1083 and Ayerbe, around the same time. The advances towards the south were faster at the end of the century, both by the lack of support of Alfonso to the Zaragozans and by the march of the Cid to the Levant, who until then had fought with them. In 1089, the Aragonese seized Monzón, which hindered communications between Lérida and Huesca, and in 1091 they built the castle of El Castellar, between Zaragoza and Tudela. Sancho started the siege of the important city of Huesca in 1094, but died of an arrow shot. He was immediately succeeded by his son Pedro. He soon resumed the siege.

King Pedro I of Aragon (1070-1104) conquered Huesca on November 27, 1096, after defeating King Al-Musta'in II of Taifa of Zaragoza in the battle of Alcoraz, which was fought on November 18 of that year. In 1101 he took Barbastro and Sariñena, and took Tamarite de Litera in 1104. In this reign the Fuero de Infanzones was regulated.

During the reign of Alfonso I the Battler (1104-1134), in the course of a few years, with the valuable collaboration of the feudal nobility of southern France, the urban centers and regions of Tudela, Tarazona, Calatayud, Daroca and Zaragoza were conquered, and after the death of his brother Pedro I of Aragon, he decided to act on the Cinco Villas and in 1105 he conquered Ejea de los Caballeros.

The king of Saragossa, Al-Musta'in II decided to carry out a plundering expedition against the neighboring Christians in the year 1110 and ended up fighting with the border knights in the battle of Valtierra where he was defeated and killed. The capture of Saragossa in 1118 meant the fall of the entire Moorish kingdom, thus radically changing the social structures and spiritual horizons of the small kingdom of highlanders that until then had been Aragon.

In 1120 the Aragonese monarch conquered Calatayud, Daroca, granted a charter to Soria and that same year the Aragonese army won a very important victory over the Muslims in the battle of Cutanda. 1125 saw the organization of the great military expedition of Alfonso I of Aragon through Andalusia, demonstrating the weakness of Almoravid power in Levante and Andalusia.

King Battallador, who had failed in his marriage to the Leonese queen Urraca, had no descendants. In his singular will, he made the military orders heirs to his kingdoms, but nobody thought of fulfilling this will and the Aragonese nobles, gathered in Jaca, recognized his brother Ramiro as king. For their part, the Navarrese elected García Ramírez, which determined the separation of the Kingdom of Navarre. At that time Ramiro was bishop of Roda-Barbastro, but he had to occupy the throne.

Ramiro II of Aragon (1086-1157) reigned for only three years, from 1134 to 1137, and was married to Inés de Poitou, daughter of Duke William IX of Aquitaine, who was crowned in Saragossa in 1134.

In 1137 Ramiro II the Monk arranged the betrothal of Petronila of Aragon to Ramón Berenguer IV of Barcelona. Their son, Alfonso II, was the first king to inherit the titles of King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona.

At its greatest territorial extension, the Kingdom of Aragon was made up of the territories that today form the Autonomous Community of Aragon, plus a large part of the current province of Lérida, most of the Ebro valley up to the sea, with Tortosa as the main coastal city, and the north of the current province of Castellón. This expansion was articulated through the creation of the Marquisates of Lérida and Tortosa, although they were later ceded by James I of Aragon to the Principality of Catalonia.

Ferdinand II (1479-1516) married Isabella I of Castile. Their grandson, Charles I, inherited both crowns, but each maintained its own laws and customs.

In 1700, with the death of Charles II, Philip of Anjou was proclaimed king of Castile and Aragon, which provoked the War of the Spanish Succession. The Crown of Aragon sided with Archduke Charles, the other pretender. When the war ended, Philip V promulgated the decrees of Nueva Planta, which abolished the foral institutions of the Crown of Aragon, which was integrated into a modern and centralized state in most of its territory, except in the Basque Provinces and Navarre, which continued to maintain their fueros. In 1711 the Captaincy General of Aragon was created.

Fueros is a term that can have several meanings. They were a pact between the king and the inhabitants of a place, which could be a city or an entire kingdom. The fueros of Aragon were the set of laws in force in the Kingdom of Aragon, compiled in 1247.

They replaced the local charters that existed previously, such as the charter of Jaca, granted by King Sancho el Mayor, who granted good charters to encourage the settlement in the city of Christians from the other side of the Pyrenees. These charters, or charters derived from them, were later granted to other cities and towns in Aragon and were also the basis for charters granted to towns in other kingdoms.

The Justice of Aragon began as a judge of the Court, and in 1265 was established as a judge of lawsuits between the nobles and the king and as president of the Cortes of the kingdom. At first he was appointed by the king from among the nobles, but ended up being a dignity sometimes for life and hereditary, his prerogatives being cut in 1592 as a result of the Alterations of Aragon.

In 1283, after King Peter III was excommunicated by Pope Martin IV for having occupied Sicily, a feudatory kingdom of the Holy See, the Aragonese oligarchy confederated to limit royal power and extract new privileges. The king was forced to grant the General Privilege in what would be known as the revolt of the Union in 1283. His son James II is forced to grant the Privilege of the Union. During the reign of James I, various assemblies, more or less crowded, had met to settle lawsuits. The Privilege of the Union requires the annual convocation of a court of nobles and citizens, which will end up including four arms: the rich men, the infanzones and knights, the ecclesiastical authorities and the universities. At that time, the cities, towns and communities of the kingdom were called universities. The Courts of Aragon were not convened with the required regularity, but eventually took control of the kingdom's taxation, granting funds to the king in exchange for the maintenance and extension of the privileges of the estates represented in them. 

The General Delegation of the Kingdom was created in 1363 as the body delegated by the Cortes to collect and administer taxes and tariffs, and to deliver the agreed funds to the king. The four branches of the Cortes are represented in it, with two deputies for each branch. Over time its attributions will grow as it will be in charge of the administration of the funds necessary to preserve the peace and welfare of the kingdom. 

Ferdinand the Catholic instituted the figure of the Viceroy, who would exercise the royal powers when the king was absent from the kingdom, something that would frequently happen with the monarchs of the House of Austria. The Viceroy was responsible for the Governor, who was in charge of maintaining order and social peace, and the Royal Audience, a court that would impart justice in serious or very important cases, or those that affected individuals with privileges. He also established the authority of the Inquisition in the kingdom, a body that later kings abused to circumvent the provisions of the Aragonese fueros, which did not prevail over the Inquisition, as occurred in the Alterations of Aragon.
The oldest administrative system of the kingdom was based on the distribution of towns and lands to the nobles who participated in the conquest. The nobles could receive these honors in property or in tenancy, when the king reserved the property but ceded its administration to the noble. The nobles could receive castles in tenancy, being in charge of keeping them garrisoned in exchange for populating and obtaining rents from the lands they controlled.

The king also granted the administration of lands and towns to the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Bishoprics, archpriestships, abbeys and military orders administered and collected rents from the honors granted to them.

Over time, the king will begin to create a network of officials to control the lands and towns directly dependent on him, called realengo. The merino was an executive, judicial and military agent of the monarch that is already documented in the Fuero de Jaca. The bailes began with similar competencies, but ended up specializing in the management of the royal patrimony. The king granted to cities and villas of royalty privileges that specified the privileges of their neighbors. The regions of Daroca, Teruel, Calatayud, Albarracín and others were organized into communities that sent their own representatives to the Cortes. In the 15th century, the territory of the kingdom was divided into eleven overcollides for tax purposes, which were converted into paths, with some modifications, in the 17th century.

Before the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the population in what would later become Aragon was a mixture of Iberian and Celtiberian substratum with Roman colonizers and Visigoth invaders, with Vascones occupying the Pyrenean valleys. There was also a Jewish minority, the result of the 1st century diaspora. This minority, tolerated by the Romans, was being persecuted by the Visigoths in the period prior to the Muslim invasion.

The Muslim invaders were not very numerous, being mainly Berbers, but also, in later waves, Arabs and Syrians. Those established in the Ebro valley were mostly Arabs, divided between Qaysids and Kalbis, Arabs from the north and south. The majority of the Muslim population in the area at the time of the reconquest were Muladis, Christians converted to Islam. Those Christians who did not convert, called Mozarabs, were tolerated by the Muslim rulers in exchange for the payment of special taxes.

The first counts of the Marca Hispanica were Franks, but in time they were replaced by local elites, Vasconas and Hispano-Visigoths. The kings of Pamplona and later of Aragon promoted the immigration of Franks and Occitanians to their kingdoms, as well as Mozarabs. With the invasion of the Almohad fundamentalists, Jewish communities from al-Andalus also migrated to the Christian kingdoms. After the conquest of the Ebro valley, a considerable number of Muslims became subjects of the king of Aragon. These Muslims, called Mudejars, formed an important part of the artisan and agricultural class of the kingdom, as reflected in the widespread Aragonese Mudejar architecture.

The 13th century was the golden age of the Jews of Aragon. The Jewish minority was eminently urban, engaging in all kinds of occupations, but excelling in medicine, administration, tax collection and lending. The Jews were considered property of the crown, and the king provided them with protection in exchange for special contributions. The same century saw the arrival of Cathar refugees from Occitania, fleeing religious persecution. The situation of the Jews worsened at the end of the century due to pressure from the Catholic hierarchy, and they were forbidden to hold public office. Many Aragonese Jews converted to Christianity, with greater or lesser conviction, to avoid high taxes and persecution. These converts were integrated into the Christian population, even mixing with noble families. This could explain the significant frequency of Jewish haplotypes in the contemporary Aragonese population.

The internal conflicts, the war with Castile and above all the Black Death and other epidemics in the 14th century produced an important decrease in the population of the kingdom. In 1492 the Catholic Monarchs decreed the conversion or expulsion of the Jews. In 1495 a census was taken, the fogaje of 1495, which revealed a total of 51 540 fires in the kingdom, or about 200 000 inhabitants. Muslims then made up 11% of the total population. The most populated city, Zaragoza, had less than 20,000 inhabitants.

In 1525 Charles I also decreed the conversion or expulsion of the Mudejars, being baptized most of the Muslims of Aragon in 1526. During the 16th century the total population grew by 50%, especially on the banks of the Ebro and its tributaries on the right bank. Part of the growth was due to immigration from north of the Pyrenees. In the 17th century, population growth slowed down. In 1610 some 65,000 Moriscos were expelled, about 20% of the population. Other significant factors in the slower population growth were the loss of agricultural production due to the expulsion of the Moors and periods of drought, a plague that devastated the kingdom from 1647 to 1654, the increase in taxation and the uprising in Catalonia.

Already in the 18th century, the War of the Spanish Succession led to a decrease of about 10% in population, including the emigration of many of the residents of French origin after Archduke Charles decreed their expulsion.

Aïr Mountains

The Aïr Mountains is a triangular massif, located in north Niger, inside the Sahara. They rise to more than and go over . In the desert, north of the Aïr plateau, with an average altitude between , forms an island of Sahel, which supports a wide variety of life, many pastoral and farming communities, and geological and archaeological sites. There are notable archaeological findings in the region that picture together the prehistoric past of this land. The endangered African wild dog ("Lycaon pictus") once existed in this region, but may now be locally extinct due to human population pressure in this region.

Marsh crake

The marsh crake or koitareke ("Porzana pusilla affinis") is a bird in the family Gruiformes. It is a subspecies of Baillon's crake. It lives in New Zealand.

The marsh crake is about half the size of a blackbird. It is about 15-18 cm long and it weighs 30 to 40 grams. It has a short tail and long legs. The feathers on its back are deep brown with black and white marks. The feathers on its belly are gray and white. Its eyes are bright red. Its beak and legs are green. The young birds have brown bellies instead of gray and white.

Marsh crakes live in wetlands, for example marshes. They also live among the reed plants in places where rivers meet the ocean. They can live on wet pastures and willow tree forests too. There are more marsh crakes on New Zealand's South Island than on North Island.

Scientists do not know much about what the marsh crake does. They think it might migrate like other Baillon's crakes do, but they are not sure.

The marsh crake eats animals without bones but it also eats the seeds of water plants.

Marsh crakes form one-on-one pairs to lay eggs. The males fly courtship flights to impress the females. They build nests out of dry plants and hide them in sedge. The female lays 5-7 eggs at a time. Both the male and female crake sit on the eggs. The eggs take 16-20 days to hatch. The chicks have black and brown feathers.

The marsh crake is declining, which means there are fewer of them than there were, and the numbers are still going down. This is because human beings drain their marshes to turn them into dry land.

Also, human beings brought cats, dogs, weasel-like animals, rats to New Zealand. All of these animals can kill the birds, their eggs, and their chicks.

Less often, a marsh crake will be hit by a car or fly into a power line. If human beings make too much noise near a nest, the parent birds will run away and the eggs will die.

Glosa (auxiliary language)

Glosa is an international auxiliary language. Glosa is an isolating language, which means that words never change form, and spelling is completely regular and phonetic.

As an isolating language, there are no inflections, so that words always remain in their dictionary form, no matter what function they have in the sentence. As a result, grammatical functions, when not clear from the context, are taken over by a small number of operator words and by the use of word order (syntax).

Glosa takes most of its vocabulary from Greek and Latin roots, seen by the authors as international in a sense by their usage in science.

Glosa is based on an older draft auxiliary language from 1943 called Interglossa, which was developed by Lancerot Hogben in 1943.

Ron Clark discovered Interglossa in 1960. He joined Hogben to develop the language. Wendy Ashby joined them in 1972. After Hogben's death in 1975, Ron and Wendy made many changes in the language and they renamed it Glosa.

In 1979, they tested the language with volunteers from the city they were living in. Also, the first dictionary was published.

Since 1987, the NGO Glosa Education Organisation (GEO) promotes the language. Its official website was created in 1996 by Paul O. Bartlett. Later, Marcel Springer became the person in charge of it.

In 2021, a wiki in Glosa was created by Vicente Costalago.

Glosa spelling is completely regular and phonetic: one spelling always represents one sound, and one sound is always represented by one spelling. With the sole exception of "SC" which represents the sound (as “sh” in "short"), every letter just represents one sound, and vice versa. Glosa is written with the Latin letters.

Glosa contains two major groups of words:

Primitives are the small number of basic function words present in most languages—these allow us to describe the relationships between the major ideas we bring across. These are basically prepositions and conjunctions, such as: de [of], e [and], pre [before], supra [above], sub [under; below; lower; beneath; lesser; somewhat].

Substantives here are the group of words that represents the more complex things, actions and descriptions (sometimes usable for all three) present in a language, such as: via [road], kurso [run], hedo [happy], vide [see], celera [swift], tako [fast; quick; prompt; hurry; rate; speed]; oku [eye]. Please note that many of these words have many meanings, based on how they are used in a sentence (verb, adjective, etc.), for example: ""oku"" can mean ""eye"", ""optical"", ""see (look)"", ""perceive (with the eyes)"", or ""to peep"".

Glosa words can often serve as more than one part of speech. Thus part of speech is a role that the word plays in a sentence, not a property of a word.

The reflexive pronoun ”oneself” is se, the reciprocal pronoun alelo means ”each other”, and the emphatic auto is used for “self, own“.

Most words can act as verbs, depending on their places in the sentence (usually in the middle).

"Prior word" here means a word used immediately before the verb of the sentence or clause in order to show its tense. For example:

Adjectives, like the rest of the language do not change. They are generally placed before the word that they modify.

To create "opposites", one just places ""no-"" as a prefix to the adjective. It is the equivalent of some of the uses on in- or un- in English.

In addition to the above, there is the prefix/beginning "singu-" (each), and the suffixes/endings "-numera" (amount/number), "-speci" (quality/kind of) and "-kron" (time), which can be used in the same way as the above.

"Qo horo?" can also be used for “What time?” or “What is the time?”.

The basic demonstratives are:
The demonstratives can also be used in the same way as the words in the table above: "u-ci mode, u-la mode" (thus; in this way, in that way), "u-ci ka, u-la ka" (for this cause, for that cause), "u-ci te" (with this intention), etc.

For “this time”, there's also "nu" (now), and for “that much/that many”, you can say "tanto"; for “that kind” "talo".

To change a phrase into a question, "qe" is placed at the beginning of the sentence.

The numbers from 0–10 are: "ze, mo, bi, tri, tet, pen, six, seti, ok, nona, deka". For 0, 4, 5, 7 and 8 (ze, tet, pen, seti, ok), there's also the longer forms "zero, tetra, penta, septi" and "okto". Higher numbers are formed by combining the numerals in the number, and in some cases by proper names:

Note that some use "centi", the older form of "hekto", for “hundred”. "Centi" is now used as “hundredth” in accordance with the ISO standard usage.

When numbers are placed before the noun, they are cardinal; when they are placed after the noun, they are ordinal:

"Mo", "bi" and "tri" also means single, double and triple, respectively.

The following is the Lord's Prayer in Glosa, compared with Interglossa, Frater and English versions, respectively:



History of France

The first written records for the history of France appeared in the Iron Age. What is now France made up the most of the area known to the Romans as Gaul. Greek writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in the area: the Gauls, the Aquitani, and the Belgae. The Gauls, the largest group, were Celts that spoke what is known as the Gaulish language.

Over the course of the first millennium BCE the Greeks, Romans and Carthaginians established colonies on the Mediterranean coast and the offshore islands. The Roman Republic conquered southern Gaul and added it as the province of Gallia Narbonensis in the late 2nd century BCE. Roman Legions under Julius Caesar conquered the rest of Gaul in the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BCE. After that, a Gallo-Roman culture came out and Gaul was more and more integrated into the Roman Empire.

In the later stages of the Roman Empire, Gaul was subject to barbarian sudden attacks and migration, most importantly by the Germanic Franks. The Frankish king Clovis I united most of Gaul under his rule in the late 5th century, preparing the conditions for Frankish control in the region for hundreds of years. Frankish power reached its fullest extent under Charlemagne. The medieval Kingdom of France came out from the western part of Charlemagne's Carolingian Empire, known as West Francia, and achieved increasing importance under the rule of the House of Capet, founded by Hugh Capet in 987.

A succession crisis following the death of the last direct Capetian king in 1328 led to the series of conflicts known as the Hundred Years' War between the House of Valois and the House of Plantagenet. The war formally began in 1337 following Philip VI's attempt to grab and take control of the Duchy of Aquitaine from its holder, Edward III of England, the Plantagenet claimant to the French throne. Despite early Plantagenet victories, including the capture and ransom of John II of France, fortunes turned in favor of the Valois later in the war. Among the important figures of the war was Joan of Arc, a French peasant girl who led French forces against the English. The war ended with a Valois victory in 1453.

Victory in the Hundred Years' War had the effect of strengthening French nationalism and hugely increasing the power and reach of the French monarchy. During the "Ancien Régime" period over the next centuries, France changed into a centralized absolute monarchy through Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation. At the height of the French Wars of Religion, France became involved in another succession crisis, as the last Valois king, Henry III, fought against rival groups the House of Bourbon and the House of Guise. Henry, the Bourbon King of Navarre, won the conflict and established the Bourbon dynasty. A growing worldwide colonial empire was established in the 16th century. French political power reached a high point under the rule of Louis XIV, "The Sun King".

In the late 18th century the monarchy and connected institutions were brought down in the French Revolution. The country was ruled for a period as a Republic, until Napoleon Bonaparte's French Empire was declared. Following his defeat in the Napoleonic Wars, France went through several further government changes, being ruled as a monarchy, then briefly as a Second Republic, and then as a Second Empire, until a more lasting French Third Republic was established in 1870.

France was one of the Triple Entente powers in World War I against Germany and the Central Powers. France was one of the Allied Powers in World War II, but was conquered by Nazi Germany in 1940. The Third Republic was taken apart, and most of the country was controlled directly by Germany while the south was controlled until 1942 by the collaborationist Vichy government. Living conditions were harsh as Germany drained away food and manpower, and many Jews were killed. The Free France movement that took over the colonial empire, and coordinated the wartime Resistance. Following liberation in 1944, the Fourth Republic was established. France slowly recovered, and enjoyed a baby boom that reversed its very low fertility rate. Long wars in Indochina and Algeria drained French resources and ended in political defeat. At the beginning of the 1958 Algerian Crisis, Charles de Gaulle set up the French Fifth Republic. Into the 1960s decolonization saw most of the French colonial empire become independent, while smaller parts were included into the French state as overseas departments and collectivities. Since World War II France has been a permanent member in the UN Security Council and NATO. It played a central role in the unification process after 1945 that led to the European Union.

Women did everything from farming to making clothes. Finally, they sold many things at the market. The market was one of the most important permanent markets in the kingdom until the 20th century.

The market is run by a group of shopkeepers. It sets many traditional rules. According to it, women who marry only once in a lifetime are allowed to set up shops in the market.

Pithecopus hypochondrialis

The orange-legged leaf frog ("Pithecopus hypochondrialis") is a frog that lives in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and the Guianas. People have seen it as high as 1500 meters above sea level.

This frog hides during the day and moves at night. People have seen it sitting on shrubs and other plants in forests and in grasslands that are covered with water for part of the year. The male frog sits near ponds that dry up for part of the year and calls to the female frogs. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over the water. The tadpoles fall into the water after they hatch. Scientists have seen some of these frogs in cities.

Human beings change the places where it lives by cutting down forests to make farms and to let cows eat grass. There are also problems with fire. Some people have caught the frog to sell as pets. But because this frog can live in cities, it is not in danger of dying out.

Prostitution in Afghanistan

Prostitution in Afghanistan is illegal. Prostitution is when someone does a sex act in exchange for money or other payment. Punishments range from five to fifteen years in prison. The country is deeply religious. It is one of the most conservative countries in the world. Sex outside marriage is against the law and can be punished with death.

Because most people in Afghanistan are poor, or they have been displaced, more and more have become prostitutes. APMG Health estimated there were12,500 prostitutes in the country in 2015. In 2020 UNAIDS estimated there were 11,000 prostitutes in Kabul, Herat, Mazar and Jalalabad based on a 2019 survey. Before the foreign troops left the country, many of the brothels and prostitutes were located close to US bases.

A number of women from China, Iran, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Tajikistan have been trafficked into Afghanistan, to become prostitutes. Afghan women are also trafficked to other countries for sexual exploitation. Child prostitution in the form of Bacha Bazi is also a problem in the country.

The Taliban, who have again come to power in 2021, have values that are deeply rooted in Islamic ethics. They have punished unmarried people with up to 80 lashes. Married prostitutes are considered adulterers, under Afghan law.

Even before the Talian took control of the country, Islamic fundamentalists have killed people for having sex outside marriage, without waiting for a state trial. Prostitution is seen as very bad. To keep the family in good standing, prostitutes sometimes get killed by members of their own family.


In the 1990s, prostitution existed in secret in Kabul. The government who followed a very strict interpretation of the Islamic Sharia law had made it illegal. Melissa Ditmore reported in "Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work" that during their rule the traffic in women for prostitution had increased. Prostitutes mostly worked from their homes. These were called Qalas. In Kabul there were 25 to 30 hidden brothels.

Because women were not allowed to work during the Taliban regime of the 1990s, this forced many children to enter the sex trade to make a living. According to the 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, women from Iran, Tajikistan, China, and other places have been forced into prostitution in Afghanistan.

Many people have lived in Afghanistan as refugees. Most of these came from neighboring countries. There have been reports that Afghan women as well as boys and girls among these refugees were forced into prostitution. Because of poverty, several families have also been reported to be selling their children.

A 2007 University of Manitoba report suggests that there may be about 900 female prostitutes in Kabul. Kabul is a city with a population of over 4 million today. Latest estimates show that there may be between 11,000 and 12,500 sex workers in the country. Between 2007 and 2008, two to three people were arrested because of prostitution per week, according to the Afghan Interior Ministry's department of sexual crimes.

In Afghan culture and traditions, prostitution is seen as very shameful. Sometimes, religious extremists, kill prostitutes. In some cases, prostitutes get killed by members of their own family:

"Nikah mut'ah" is a fixed-term marriage in Shia Islam; most other Muslims reject the idea. There have also been some reports about "Mut'ah" ("Fegha" in Persian language) beginning to be practiced in Mazar-i-Sharif. 

Like in many other Islamic countries, it is a major taboo in Afghan culture for women to openly dance in front of men. Males and females are separated during weddings and other parties. As a form of adult entertainment, young males dress as females and dance in front of men to make money. ""Bacha bereesh"" (meaning "boys without beards" in Persian language) occasionally dance to entertain men at certain parties, especially in the north parts of Afghanistan. Powerful patrons sometimes sexually exploit the dancers. It is estimated that about 10,000 men across Afghanistan engage in sexual activities with other men.

In some parts of Afghanistan, people believe that the number 39 is cursed or a badge of shame: They say it is linked with prostitution.

It is unclear, why the number is undesirable. It has often been associated with a pimp, who was living in Herat: This pimp had the nickname "39", after the number plate of his expensive car, and the number of his apartment. The number is said to translate into "morda-gow", literally meaning "dead cow" but a well-known slang term for a pimp. Others have blamed corrupt police officials for spreading the rumour in order to charge between $200–500 to change a "39" plate.

Vehicle registration plates with the number are seen as so undesirable that vehicles and apartments bearing the numerals are said to be virtually unsellable in the capital, Kabul. The drivers of such vehicles have reported abuse and derision from pedestrians and other drivers. Some have had their registration plates altered to hide the numbers. One such driver, Zalmay Ahmadi, told "The Guardian": "When I drive around all the other cars flash their lights, beep their horns and people point at me. All my classmates now call me Colonel 39." Number plates containing '39' were withdrawn in early 2021.

 In 2019, the United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons downgraded Afghanistan to a 'Tier 2 watchlist' country'. In 2020, it further downgraded the country to 'Tier 3'. The Government of Afghanistan does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. The country remained in 'Tier 3' in 2021.

Women and girls from China, Iran, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Tajikistan have been subject to sex trafficking in Afghanistan. Afghan women, and children pay other people to help them find a job abroad. In most cases, they want to work in Iran, Pakistan, and in Europe. Some of these people force them into sex trafficking. In 2021 it was estimated that over 7000 young Afghan girls had been sold into prostitution in India.


Matrix (geology)

The matrix or groundmass of a rock is the finer-grained mass of material in which larger grains, crystals, or clasts are embedded.

The matrix of an igneous rock is made up of fine-grained, often tiny, crystals in which larger crystals, called phenocrysts, are embedded. In South Africa, diamonds are often mined from a matrix of weathered clay-like rock (kimberlite) called "yellow ground".

The matrix of sedimentary rocks is made up of finer-grained sedimentary material, such as clay or silt, in which larger grains or clasts are embedded.

Toyota Matrix

The Toyota Matrix, officially referred to as the Toyota Corolla Matrix, is a compact hatchback made by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada in Cambridge, Ontario. It was gotten from the Toyota Corolla. It was introduced in 2002 as a 2003 model. Toyota and General Motors worked together to make the Matrix.

Electronic game

An electronic game is either a game console that can connect to a TV to play a video game or a game that be played in someone's hand. Electronic games are often bought by younger people including kids, teenagers and people who have special needs as people with special needs particular autism like games with repetitive sound. 

Electronic games were most common being sold in the 1990's when it was the best time in the world to make them, manufacturer and sell them. 

In the 1980's, a game called Simon was released by Milton Bradley which also had a 'Super' variant called the Super Simon. 

In the 90's there were 2 major games being sold - Bop It and Brain Warp, as well as a second edition of Bop It called the Bop It Extreme which was released in 1999 by Hasbro voiced by Scott Parkin. There was a game called Brain Shift that wasn't popular, but a rare low pitched unit was discovered in 2003 which lasted until 2009. Bop It was re-released again in 2008 as Bop It! and Simon was also re-released 3 years later by Hasbro and then KID Group made Simon Swipe. 

Electronic games require batteries to run and the manufacture adds a hidden 'test mode' on which the user can use to capture samples to make another game. Although the samples themselves won't be as good as the original studio quality samples, they can be good quality enough to be re-used in another game.

Reduced affect display

Reduced affect displays (better known as emotional blunting) is the condition where a person has a reduced emotional reaction. People with this condition have problems expressing their feelings. They are unble to do this while they talk about certain problems which normally cause people to express emotions. Expressive gestures aren't common. There is also little or no animation in the facial expressions or the changes for certain people's voices. Reduced affect is often the symptom of autism, depression, schizoid personality disorder, schizophrenia or even post-traumatic stress disorder. It is also often the side effect of certain drugs (these tend to include antipsychotic or antidepressant drugs).

Reduced affect is different from apathy and anhedonia (these others mean not having enough or "any" emotion). Reduced affect means not enough or any "expressions" of emotion (affect displays), without mattering whether or not emotions are actually reduced.

Constricted or restricted affects mean when one's abilities to express themselves with certain levels of emotional intensity are limited or not done fully.

Blunted affect is totally different from flat affects. "Blunted" (in "blunted affects") means people still have affects. These people's responses in emotions, however, are usually not intense or strong like others would normally predict.

Martin Hemings

Martin Hemings (1755-????) was a man from Virginia. He was the oldest male child of Elizabeth "Betty" Hemings. History does not say who his father was, but it was not John Wayles. Martin Hemings was the half-brother of Sally Hemings and James Hemings. He was enslaved to Thomas Jefferson. He worked as Jefferson's butler at Monticello.

According to Madison Hemings, Sally Hemings' grandmother was a fully African woman and might have been born in Africa. She was enslaved to the Eppes family in Virginia. Historians do not know for sure what her name was. Papers with the names of enslaved women in the Eppes family include "Dinah," "Judy," "Abbie," "Sarah," "Parthenia," and others. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed said that there were many girls named "Thenia" in the Hemings family, and they might have been named after Parthenia. But she also says that "Sally" is a nickname for "Sarah," and there were many girls named "Sarah" and "Sally" in the Hemings family too.

Martin Hemings' mother was called Elizabeth "Betty" Hemings. Martin Hemings' nephew Madison Hemings told the story: Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman and her father was an English sea captain named Hemings. The sea captain tried to buy Elizabeth Hemings from her owner, but the owner said no. He said he wanted to see what a half-white, half-African child would look like. Then Captain Hemings tried to take the child away from the owner without paying, but someone told the owner about his plan. Captain Hemings left Virginia and did not come back.

Captain Hemings tried to take his daughter from one of the men in the Eppes family, but historians do not know which one because they do not know when Elizabeth Hemings was born. One paper says "about 1735." 

Elizabeth Hemings lived at the Eppes family's house, which was called Bermuda Hundred, until 1746. That year, Martha Eppes married John Wayles. Elizabeth and other enslaved people went with Martha to Wayle's house as part of her marriage settlement. A marriage settlement was any property that a married woman could control and her husband couldn't. Technically, the Eppes family owned Elizabeth Hemings.

Elizabeth Hemings had many children. Martin Hemings was born on a plantation called The Forest that belonged to John Wayles. History does not say who his father was. John Wayles was the father of most of Elizabeth Hemings' other children.

When Martha Wayles Skelton married Thomas Jefferson, Hemings and many people in her family went with Martha Skelton to Jefferson's house at Monticello. Martin Hemings was 17 or 18 years old. He later became the butler of Monticello and lived there for many years. When Thomas Jefferson became governor of Virginia and lived in houses in Richmond, Virginia and Williamsburg, Virginia, Martin Hemings went with him.

We do not know what Martin Hemings was like when he was around other black people. This is because no writings about this survive. But many of Thomas Jefferson's letters have been saved and copied. Thomas Jefferson wrote about the enslaved people a lot. Thomas Jefferson wrote about Martin having a fiery temper.Jefferson's granddaughters said he had a gloomy temper and became angry if anyone but Jefferson gave him orders.

During the American Revolutionary War, the British army captured Monticello. Martin Hemings hid the valuable silver tableware—forks, knives and other items for eating. He hid them under the floorboards. Another enslaved man, called Caesar, hid with them and could not get out for days. Martin did not tell the British soldiers where the silver was, not even when they hit him.

Jefferson's granddaughters told historian Henry S. Randall the family story: A British officer pointed a gun at Martin Hemings and told Hemings to say which way Jefferson had gone. "Fire away, then," answered Hemings.

White people wrote about how this showed Martin was loyal to his master and his country. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed writes that perhaps Martin just did not like being told what to do.

Jefferson was away from Monticello a lot. After his wife died, he wanted to be somewhere else. He even went to Paris for years when he was the United States Ambassador to France. During these times, enslaved people in the Hemings family were allowed to come and go as they wanted. The Hemings men lived almost like free black men: They could find jobs where they wanted and keep all the money they earned.

When Jefferson came back from Paris, he wanted his butler, Martin Hemings, to stay at Monticello. But Hemings had been used to living his own life. He "ran away" from Monticello many times. Sometimes he stayed away for months, working another job somewhere else. But someone always caught him and brought him back.

In 1792, Thomas Jefferson wrote that he and Martin Hemings had had a disagreement or fight. He did not say what the fight was. He told one of his managers at Monticello that he and Martin Hemings had agreed on what to do: Jefferson would sell Martin Hemings to someone else. Martin Hemings was 36 or 37 at the time. Jefferson told the manager that Martin Hemings could choose another master. He said he did not care how much money he got for Hemings, so long as Hemings was gone. He also told the manager that he did not want to free Martin Hemings, the way he would free his half-brothers Robert and James later in their lives.

This means:

"Martin and I had such a bad disagreement that he asked me to sell him to someone else. I think I should do it. He should not work for me any more. Please find him another master that he thinks would be good. I don't care about the money. Martin can even choose his new master, but I will not free him. Please find a buyer quickly. I do not want to talk to or argue with Martin about this."

Thomas Jefferson's letters and writings about Monticello say that Martin Hemings was still at Monticello in 1795. His writings do not say that Jefferson sold Martin Hemings. Then Jefferson's writings stop talking about Hemings altogether. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed thinks Martin Hemings died of natural causes before Jefferson and Hemings could find a buyer.

Wildlife conservation

Wildlife conservation refers to the practice of protecting wild species and their habitats in order to maintain healthy wildlife species or populations and to restore, protect or enhance natural ecosystems. Major threats to wildlife include habitat destruction, degradation, fragmentation, overexploitation, poaching, pollution and climate change. The IUCN estimates that 27,000 species of the ones assessed are at risk for extinction. Expanding to all existing species, a 2019 UN report on biodiversity put this estimate even higher at a million species. It is also being acknowledged that an increasing number of ecosystems on Earth containing endangered species are disappearing. To address these issues, there have been both national and international governmental efforts to preserve Earth's wildlife.

Feminist pornography

People who were active in the sex-positive feminism movement developed feminist pornography. Like normal pornography, the aim is to show sexually explicit images, or describe situations which help to sexually arouse women. Most pornography is made for men; it often uses stereotypes. Feminist pornography wants to break out of these stereotyped gender roles. 

Much like regular pornography, feminist pornography uses explicit images. Most pornography made for men use shallow stereotypes. Feminist pornography wants to question these stereotypes and the way in which things such as gender, sexuality or beauty are shown. Feminist porn movies often also show disabililty. They do this more often than porn made for men: Feminist porn also shows people who are sexually active, even though they are disabled in some way. Feminist pornography looks at what is considered a normal sexual relationship, and turns against seeing one sex as better than another. More often than pornography produced for men, feninist pornography uses language to produce erotic situations. 

Most feminist porn movies were made in the last few decades. As these movies were made, people also tried to find interpretations for them and to agree on a common set of rules. These interpretations and rules change over time. The last change was made to accommodate the transgender community. In general, feminist porn wants to be seen as diverse and liberal, and to express liberal views on gender and sexuality. 


With this, feminist pornography creates an aesthetic and ethical vision of change that is neither homogeneous nor clearly defined. Jasmin Hagendorfer, artistic director of the "Porn Film Festival Vienna", describes her approach as follows:Feminist porn productions show that the desire and sexual perception of women can very well be the focus and that porn can also be women-, gender- and ultimately men-friendly. In addition, many feminist productions stand for fair working conditions, a say and consensus, which are often not found in mainstream productions. It is important to show that porn is produced by women for women and that it will also meet a wide audience. 

Christopher Boulton says that criticism of feminist pornography comes from religion, government policy, and feminism itself. The positions of these movements are very similar. The different movements want to reach them with different means, though. One of the critics is the organization Stop Porn Culture. Its main proponent is Gail Dines. According to her, the porn movement in western society is bad, especially the protection of children, and of public health. The means are very similar to those opponents of pornography used in the 1970s and 1980s. 

Like with the mainstream porn industry, the main interests of feminist pornography are about earning money. Many of the movies are produced as independent movies. Big movie companies like Vivid Entertainment, Adam and Eve and Evil Angel Productions finance and distribute feminist pornography. Feminists deal with this in different ways: Some feminists are opposed to the big companies financing or distributing the movies. Most feminists live with the fact. Courtney Trouble said she would portray almost any character in her films if the demand was there. Only in this way would she be able to get enough money for the projects in which she could show her own ideas, which are different from the mainstream. For example, she would take on the role of a Big Beautiful Woman, although she rejects this term for herself. In her view, Capitalist value creation is a means to an end.

Maria Leopoldina of Austria

Dona Maria Leopoldina of Austria (22 January 1797 – 11 December 1826) was Empress of Brazil as the wife of Emperor Dom Pedro I from 12 October 1822 until her death. She was also Queen of Portugal during her husband's brief reign as King Dom Pedro IV from 10 March to 2 May 1826.

She was born "Caroline Josepha Leopoldine Franziska Ferdinanda of Habsburg-Lorraine, Archduchess of Austria" in Vienna, Austria, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. Among her many siblings were Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria and Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma, the wife of Napoleon Bonaparte.

The education Maria Leopoldina had received in childhood and adolescence was eclectic and broad, with a higher cultural level and more consistent political training. Such education of the little princes and princesses of the Habsburg family was based on the educational belief initiated by their grandfather Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, who believed "that children should be inspired from an early age to have high qualities, such as humanity, compassion and the desire to make people happy". With a deep Christian faith and a solid scientific and cultural background (which included international politics and notions of government) the Archduchess had been prepared from an early age to being a proper royal consort.

In the 21st century, it has been proposed by some historians that she was one of the main articulators of the process of Independence of Brazil that took place in 1822. Her biographer, historian Paulo Rezzutti, maintains that it was largely thanks to her that Brazil became a nation. According to him, the wife of Dom Pedro "embraced Brazil as her country, Brazilians as her people and Independence as her cause". She was also adviser to Dom Pedro on important political decisions that reflected the future of the nation, such as the "Dia do Fico" and the subsequent opposition and disobedience to the Portuguese courts regarding the couple's return to Portugal. Consequently, for governing the country on Dom Pedro's trips through the Brazilian provinces, she is considered the first woman to become head of state in an independent American country.

Tibetan calendar

The Tibetan calendar, or the Tibetan lunar calendar is a calendar based on 12 or 13 phases of the moon, which starts with a new moon, or when the moon is completely dark. A lunar month is added every 2 or 3 years to equal the solar year.

The Tibetan New Years celebration is called Losar. According to almanacs, or yearly calendar with important dates, the year starts with the third Hor month, or the Third Mongolian month.

Every month, certain dates in the calendar are used for Buddhist practices. Similarly, certain months also have importance.

Years in the Tibetan calendar are similar to the Chinese zodiac, with animals signifying each year. The animals go as follows:

There are also elements. Each element goes as follows:

Each elements is associated with two years. First as male, and second as female. For example, a male Earth-Dragon year is followed by a female Earth-Snake year, then by a male Iron-Horse year.

During the time of the Tibetan Empire (7th – 9th century), Tibetan months were named according to the four seasons:

Numantia

Numantia (Spanish: "Numancia") was an ancient Celtiberian settlement. Its remains are located 7 km north of the city of Soria, on a hill known as "Cerro de la Muela" in the municipality of Garray.

Numantia is famous for its role in the Celtiberian Wars. It was a city that became famous for its resistance against the Roman armies.

The first human settlements in Numantia were established in the III millennium BC. Shepherds who made seasonal movements with their flocks inhabited this area. The area had a harsh climate but the pastures were rich.

Towards the 8th century BC., handmade ceramics were used in this settlement. From the 7th century BC., the settlement became a "castro". Around 350 BC., Numantia had many inhabitants and was born as a city. 

Roman authors don't agree on the people that lived there. Pliny the Elder believed it was the Pellendones. However, other authors, like Strabo and Ptolemy say in their writings that the city belongs to the Arevaci people.

In 153 BC, Numantia had its first serious conflict with Rome.

After 20 years of fighting, in 133 BC, the Roman Senate gave Scipio Aemilianus Africanus the task of destroying Numantia.

After 13 months of siege, the Numantians decided to burn the city before surrendering. The few survivors were sold as slaves. 

Numantia was rebuilt in the time of Augustus. It was repopulated with Celtiberians.

Today, Numancia is an archaeological site in the province of Soria.

It was declared a "Bien de Interés Cultural" (Site of Cultural Interest) on the 29th August 1882.

This site is being excavated by a group of archaeologists from the Complutense University of Madrid under the direction of Alfredo Jimeno. It receives funds from the Junta de Castile and León.

Since 2007 there is a controversy as the Junta of Castile and León allowed the construction of industrial estate near the ruins. Several institutions have protested against that plan despite the statement from official authorities saying that the remains won't be damaged.

Mary Hemings Bell

Mary Hemings Bell (1753-18??) was a woman from Virginia. She was the oldest child of Elizabeth "Betty" Hemings. History does not say who her father was, but it was not John Wayles. Mary Hemings was the half-sister of Sally Hemings and James Hemings. For part of her life, she was enslaved to Thomas Jefferson.

According to Mary Hemings' nephew, Madison Hemings, Mary Hemings' grandmother was a fully African woman and might have been born in Africa. She was enslaved to the Eppes family in Virginia. Historians do not know for sure what her name was. Papers with the names of enslaved women in the Eppes family include "Dinah," "Judy," "Abbie," "Sarah," "Parthenia," and others. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed said that there were many girls named "Thenia" in the Hemings family, and they might have been named after Parthenia. But she also says that "Sally" is a nickname for "Sarah," and there were many girls named "Sarah" and "Sally" in the Hemings family too.

Mary Hemings' mother was called Elizabeth "Betty" Hemings. Mary Hemings' nephew Madison Hemings told the story: Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman and her father was an English sea captain named Hemings. The sea captain tried to buy Elizabeth Hemings from her owner, but the owner said no. He said he wanted to see what a half-white, half-African child would look like. Then Captain Hemings tried to take the child away from the owner without paying, but someone told the owner about his plan. Captain Hemings left Virginia and did not come back.

Captain Hemings tried to take his daughter from one of the men in the Eppes family, but historians do not know which one because they do not know when Elizabeth Hemings was born. One paper says "about 1735." 

Elizabeth Hemings lived at the Eppes family's house, which was called Bermuda Hundred until 1746. That year, Martha Eppes married John Wayles. Elizabeth and other enslaved people went with Martha to Wayle's house as part of her marriage settlement. A marriage settlement was any property that a married woman could control and her husband couldn't. Technically, the Eppes family owned Elizabeth Hemings.

Elizabeth Hemings had many children. Mary Hemings was the oldest. History does not say who her father was. John Wayles was the father of six of Elizabeth Hemings' other children.

When Martha Wayles Skelton married Thomas Jefferson, Hemings and many people in her family went with Martha Skelton to Jefferson's house at Monticello. Mary Hemings was 19 or 20 years old.

Mary Hemings had four children while she lived at Monticello. Her son Joseph Fosset might have been then son of a free white man named William Fossett who also lived at Monticello. Historians do not know for sure what their relationship was like, but most of them think that if she named her son "Fosset," she must have liked him.

Thomas Jefferson gave Mary Hemings' two oldest children away. Daniel went to live with Jefferson's sister and Molly went to live with his daughter.

When Thomas Jefferson was in Paris as the United States Ambassador to France, Mary Hemings worked for a man named Thomas Bell who lived in Charlottesville, Virginia. She brought her children Joseph and Betsy with her. She had two more children at Bell's house. In 1792, Mary Hemings asked Thomas Jefferson to sell her to Bell, and he did. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed says this was a normal thing for Jefferson to do: To sell an enslaved person so they could live in the same place as someone else in their family. She writes that Jefferson knew Bell was the father of Hemings' young children but did not talk about it. He wrote to his manager, Nicholas Lewis, saying to "dispose of Mary according to her desire, with such of her younger children as she chose." He meant that Bell could buy Mary Hemings and his own children but not Mary Hemings' other children. They could not stay and live with Bell and their half-siblings. They had to go back to Monticello without their mother.

Mary lived with Bell until he died in 1800. He did not legally free her but he did unofficially free her. In his will, he left his property to their children. He wrote his will as if Mary and his children were free, and his neighbors respected it.

When Jefferson sold Mary Hemings to Thomas Bell, he did not let her keep her older children with her. They went back to his house at Monticello.

Betty Hemings

Elizabeth "Betty" Hemings (1735-1807) was a woman from Virginia. She was the mother of Sally Hemings and eleven other people. For part of her life, she was enslaved to Thomas Jefferson. Hers was the largest family to live at Monticello.

According to Elizabeth Hemings' grandson, Madison Hemings, her mother was a fully African woman and might have been born in Africa. She was enslaved to the Eppes family in Virginia. Historians do not know for sure what her name was. Papers with the names of enslaved women in the Eppes family include "Dinah," "Judy," "Abbie," "Sarah," "Parthenia," and others. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed said that there were many girls named "Thenia" in the Hemings family, and they might have been named after Parthenia, also spelled Parthena. But she also says that "Sally" is a nickname for "Sarah," and there were many girls named "Sarah" and "Sally" in the Hemings family too. So Elizabeth Hamings' mother's white name was probably Parthenia or Sarah.

Madison Hemings told the story: Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman and her father was an English sea captain named Hemings. The sea captain tried to buy Elizabeth Hemings from her owner when she was born. Even though he offered the owner a lot of money, the owner still said no. He said he wanted to see what a half-white, half-African child would look like. Then Captain Hemings tried to take the child away from the owner without paying, but someone told the owner about his plan. Captain Hemings left Virginia and did not come back.

Captain Hemings tried to take his daughter from one of the men in the Eppes family, but historians do not know which one because they do not know when Elizabeth Hemings was born. One paper says "about 1735."

Elizabeth Hemings lived at the Eppes family's house, which was called Bermuda Hundred until 1746. That year, Martha Eppes married John Wayles. Elizabeth and other enslaved people went with Martha to Wayle's house as part of her marriage settlement. A marriage settlement was any property that a married woman could control and her husband couldn't. Technically, the Eppes family owned Elizabeth Hemings.

Elizabeth Hemings lived as a house servant. That means she did not grow tobacco or cotton in the fields like other enslaved people in Virginia did. Historians think that Elizabeth Hemings' job with the Wayles family was to help raise Martha Wayles, later Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson. After Johyn Wayles' wife died, he made Elizabeth Hemings his concubine, which means they had a sexual relationship but he did not free her or marry her. Historians do not know how Elizabeth Hemings felt about this.

When Martha Wayles Skelton married Thomas Jefferson, Hemings and many people in her family went with Martha Skelton to Jefferson's house at Monticello. Historians think Elizabeth Hemings took care of Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson when she became sick and that she was there when she died.

In the last years of her life, Elizabeth Hemings moved to a small house partway down the mountain, away from the main house of Monticello and from her children and grandchildren. She lived next to free working families. She raised vegetables and chickens. Later, archaeologists would find that she owned many pieces of good porcelain China.

Elizabeth Hemings died at the age of 72. According to Madison Hemings, he was three years old, and he tried to give her some bread to eat. Elizabeth Hemings' last words to him were, "Granny don't want bread no more."

John Wayles was the father of six of Elizabeth Hemings' children. After moving to Monticello, Elizabeth Hemings also had at least one child with Joseph Neilson, a white carpenter who worked for Thomas Jefferson.

2021 Cumbre Vieja volcanic eruption

The 2021 Cumbre Vieja volcanic eruption was a volcanic eruption of Cumbre Vieja on the island of La Palma, one of the most active volcanoes in the Canary Islands, Spain. It is the first volcanic eruption on the island since the eruption of Teneguía in 1971. At 85 days, it is the longest known eruption of a volcano on La Palma.

The eruption began at 16:12 UTC on 19 September 2021 in a forested area called Cabeza de Vaca.

An earthquake swarm started on 11 September, which led to the volcanic eruption on 19 September.

Around 300 people from the local area were evacuated shortly after the eruption.

The eruption led to the evacuation of more than 8,000 people, and the lava has destroyed more than 3,000 buildings.

It is the most damaging volcanic eruption on La Palma since records began.

Initially, when the eruption started, it had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 0, when it was a purely lava eruption. But with the ashfall that began a week later, the Volcanic Explosivity Index of the eruption rose to 2.

On 28 September, at around 23:02 UTC, the lava flow reached the sea at the Perdido Beach.

On 20 November, the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) was upgraded from VEI 2 to VEI 3, when the ashfall reached 10 million m³.

On 12 December, the volcanic eruption broke the local record, when it reached 85 days of continuous activity. The eruption is the longest known eruption of a volcano on La Palma. Previously, the eruption of the Tajuya volcano in 1585 was the longest at 84 days. No reliable data is available about earlier volcanic eruptions, before Spanish colonization of La Palma in the 15th century.

On 13 December, the volcanic eruption stopped. Noting weak seismicity and zero tremors, scientists said that a resumption of the eruption is highly unlikely, giving locals hope that it is over.

On 25 December 2021, after 12 days with no activity from the volcano, the eruption was officially declared to have ended.

Killing of Gabby Petito

Gabrielle Venora Petito (March 19, 1999 – August 27, 2021) was an American woman from Suffolk County, New York, who was reported missing on September 11, 2021. Her body was found on September 19 in Wyoming with her cause of death being a homicide. Her partner, Brian Laundrie, was the main suspect behind her death. He was found dead on October 20, 2021.

Petito was traveling across the United States with her fiancé. Her family lost contact with her in late August when she was in or near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. Her fiancé, Brian Laundrie, is missing and wanted for questioning in her disappearance and death.

On September 19, 2021, authorities said they found a body that matched what Petito looked like. It was discovered in Bridger–Teton National Forest, Wyoming. Two days later it was confirmed that the remains were Petito's and, based on reports from an autopsy, it was reported that her cause of death was homicide. In October, her death was determined to have occurred three to four weeks before her body was found with the cause being homicide by strangulation.

Police officials are searching for Petito's ex-fiance Brian Laundrie, was missing beginning on September 14. He was the main suspect in her death. On September 22, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warrant for Laundrie's arrest on charges of debit card fraud.

On October 20, Laundrie's remains and some of his belongings were found at a park in North Port, Florida, that had recently been underwater due to flooding.

Solomon Northup

Solomon Northup (July 10, – ) was an American abolitionist. He wrote the memoir "Twelve Years a Slave". He was born as a free African American. He was a farmer and a professional violinist. He owned land in Washington County, New York. 

In 1841, he was offered a traveling musician's job. He went to Washington, D.C., where slavery was legal. He was drugged, kidnapped, and sold as a slave. He was taken to New Orleans and was a slave for 12 years in Louisiana. 

He remained a slave until he met Samuel Bass, a Canadian working on his plantation who helped send letters to New York. New York state law helped New York citizens who had been kidnapped and sold into slavery. His family and friends got help from the Governor of New York, Washington Hunt, and Northup got his freedom again on January 3, 1853.

Northup traveled through the United States making speeches about what happened to him. He did this because he wanted voters to end slavery. Northup wrote his speeches down as a book, "12 Years a Slave", and Derby published it in 1853. Northup's book was published one year after "Uncle Tom's Cabin" by Harriet Beecher Stowe. By then, people were saying that surely Beecher Stowe had only made up how bad slavery was. Northup dedicated the book to Beecher Stowe. He and Derby both said "12 Years a Slave" helped prove that Beecher Stowe had not lied about slavery being bad. They called it "Another "Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin"."

Northup is believed to have died in 1863 as that was when he was last seen or heard of.

Recess (TV series)

Recess is an American animated television series created by Paul Germain and Joe Ansolabehere (credited as "Paul and Joe") and produced by Walt Disney Television Animation, with animation done by Grimsaem, Anivision, Plus One Animation, Sunwoo Animation, and Toon City. The series focuses on six elementary school students and their interaction with other classmates and teachers. The title refers to the recess period during the daily schedule, in the North American tradition of educational schooling, when students are not in lessons and are outside in the schoolyard. During recess, the children form their own society, complete with government and a class structure, set against the backdrop of a regular school.

Recess portrays the lives of six fourth graders—cheeky and popular lovable rogue Theodore Jasper "T.J." Detweiler (Ross Malinger, Andrew Lawrence), Jock Vince LaSalle (Rickey D'Shon Collins), tomboy Ashley Spinelli (Pamela Adlon), wise fool Mikey Blumberg (Jason Davis), geek Gretchen Grundler (Ashley Johnson), and awkward new kid Gus Griswald (Courtland Mead)—as they go about their daily lives in a school environment at Third Street Elementary School located in Little Rock, Arkansas.[4][5] A major satirical point of the show is that the community of students at school is a microcosm of traditional human society complete with its own government, class system, and set of unwritten laws. They are ruled by a monarch, a sixth grader named King Bob, who has various enforcers to make sure his decrees are carried out. The society has a long list of rigid values and social norms that imposes a high expectation of conformity upon all the students.


Millard Sheets

Millard Owen Sheets (June 24, 1907 – March 31, 1989) was an American artist, teacher, and architectural designer. He was one of the earliest of the California Scene Painting artists and helped define the art movement. Many of his large-scale building-mounted mosaics from the mid-20th century are still extant in Southern California. His paintings are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum in New York, the Chicago Art Institute, the National Gallery in Washington D.C.; and the Los Angeles County Museum.

Millard Sheets was born June 24, 1907, and grew up in the Pomona Valley, east of Los Angeles. He is the son of John Gosper Sheets and (1878 – 1947) and Marilla Mae Owen (1883 – 1907). He attended the Chouinard Art Institute and studied with painters Frank Tolles Chamberlin and Clarence Hinkle. While he was still a teenager, his watercolors were accepted for exhibition in the annual California Water Color Society show. By the age of 19, he was elected into membership of the California Water Color Society. The following year he was hired to teach watercolor painting even before his graduation from Chouinard.

In 1929 he won second prize in the Texas Wildflowers Competitive Exhibitions, and the generous award allowed Sheets to travel to Europe for a year to further his art education. By the early 1930s he began to achieve national recognition as a prominent American artist. He was exhibiting in Paris, New York City, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Houston, St. Louis, San Antonio, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Baltimore, and many other cities throughout the United States. In Los Angeles he was recognized as the leading figure and driving force behind the California Style watercolor movement.

Between 1935 and 1941, his recognition, awards, and output increased, winning him repeated mention in "Art Digest" and a color reproduction of his work in the book "Eyes on America". In 1935 at age 28, he was the subject of a monograph published in Los Angeles. His art sales enabled him to travel again to Europe, Central America, and Hawaii, where he painted on location. Although his watercolor techniques during this period ranged from very tight to very loose, a consistent, he nevertheless exhibited a personal style.

During World War II, he was an artist-correspondent for "Life Magazine" and the United States Army Air Forces in India and Burma. Many of his works from this period document the scenes of famine, war, and death that he witnessed. His wartime experience also informed his post-war art for a number of years, where while painting in California and Mexico in the 1940s his work followed dark hues and depressing subjects. After the 1950s his style shifted toward brighter colors and subjects from his worldwide travels.

Watercolor and oil painting were only part of Sheets's art career. Through his teaching at Chouinard Art Institute, Otis Art Institute, Scripps College and other institutions, hundreds of artists learned how to paint, and were then guided into art careers. He directed the art exhibition at the Los Angeles County Fair for many years and brought world-class work to Southern California. During the Great Depression, he joined forces with Edward Bruce to hire artists for the Public Works of Art Project, the first New Deal art project. In 1946, he served as a president of the California Water Color Society. In later years, he worked as an architect, illustrator, muralist, printmaker, and art exhibition juror.
Outside of California, he took on commissions for the Detroit Public Library, the Mayo Clinic, the dome of the National Shrine, the University of Notre Dame library, the Hilton Hotel in Honolulu, and the Mercantile National Bank in Dallas.

In 1953, Sheets was appointed director of Otis Art Institute (later named Otis College of Art and Design). Under his leadership, the school's academic program was restructured to offer BFA and MFA degrees, and a ceramics department was created, headed by Peter Voulkos. During that time, a ceramics building, gallery, library, and studio wing were completed. By the time Sheets left Otis in 1962, the form and direction of the college had changed dramatically.

The Millard Sheets Art Center first began as the Fine Arts Program of the Los Angeles County Fair in 1922. The 20,000+ square-foot art center was built in 1937 by the Works Progress Administration to house the program, the first major gallery dedicated solely to art in Los Angeles County. Each year, the gallery provided visitors to the Los Angeles County Fair with access to art work found throughout the world. In 1994 the building was dedicated to Millard Sheets and in 2013 was identified by Fairplex as the home for year-round art education and exhibitions and is currently a part of The Learning Centers at Fairplex.

In the late 1950s, Sheets was commissioned by Howard F. Ahmanson to design Home Savings Bank branches throughout Southern California that would serve as community landmarks by expressing "community values" or presenting "a celebratory version of the community history." To accomplish this goal, Sheets designed his branch buildings with exterior façades containing large mosaic works depicting local heritage.

The Ahmanson commissions multiplied to include more than 80 branch buildings after the initial 1955 commission. Sheets resigned his teaching position at Scripps College and established the Sheets Studio in Claremont, California, employing a series of artists.

Sheets produced these mosaics as commercial commissions, and he rarely titled them. Nevertheless, they are now considered official public art and are titled by their images or theme. Although they enjoy some protections under the California Arts Preservation Act, many have been destroyed. The following Sheets Studio mosaics in Southern California have survived deterioration and demolition:


Sheets died on March 31, 1989 at his home in Anchor Bay in Mendocino County, California after a longtime illness. A service was held at his home and at the First Unitarian Church of San Diego.


Charles Reid

Charles Clark Reid (August12,1937 June1,2019) was an American painter, illustrator, and teacher, notable for his watercolor style. He has won numerous national and international awards for both his watercolor and oil works, and also hosted many workshops in the US and abroad. He has had numerous books published, instructional DVDs and created a postage stamp and an iconic ad campaign with his watercolor depictions. His watercolor works and oil paintings are in private and college museum collections.

Reid became interested in painting at the age of 14 when his parents encouraged him by letting him use a room in the family home for his art. His father gave him illustrated history books and books about Charles Marion Russell and Frederic Remington, both known for their paintings of the American Old West. Reid's father enrolled him in a correspondence course at the Famous Artists School, when he was 16 years old. Reid also attended South Kent School and the University of Vermont (1955-1957).

Disillusioned while at the University of Vermont he enrolled in the Art Students League of New York, while in Manhattan from 1957 to 1959. He met Frank J. Reilly there, who became his teacher.

He was invited to exhibit in New York City at the ROKO Gallery and at the FAR Gallery during 10 years in the 70s until its closure in 1979.

Although not a member of the American Watercolor Society, they exhibited Reid's work four times: in 1973 with "Sleeping Girl," in 1975 with "Miss Goodman", in 1978 with "Narda," and in 1984 with "Mary". Reid won the Samuel J. Bloomingdale Memorial Award with "Miss Goodman" and the High Winds Award with "Narda."

In 1975, he won the American Academy of Arts and Letters' Childe Hassam, Speicher, Betts, and Symons Purchase Fund Award with "Wally." He won the same award again in 1976 with "In the Studio."

In 1975, he was admitted as an Associate at the American National Academy of Design, and in 1983 he became an Academician.


He joined the National Academy of Design in 1980.

In 1983, he was awarded a silver medal from the Society of Illustrators.

In 1988 he joined the Century Association.

In 2013, he won a gold medal at the annual Portrait Society of America, "The Art of The Portrait" International Conference. The Gold Medal is awarded to "individuals whose work has revolutionized the practice and influenced others". Reid also won "The Purchase Award" at the second "Shanghai Zhujiajiao International Watercolor Biennial Exhibition" (also called Shanghai International Biennial Exhibition) in 2013.

He has been exhibited in major institutions including The Butler Institute of Fine Art and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. 

Reid's works are found:


Charles Reid was a pupil of Frank Reilly who was tutored by professor of drawing George Bridgman and by Franck-Vincent DuMond, both of whom were influenced and connected to the French academic style of the late 19th century. Reilly passed on these influences to Reid. Both Bridgman and DuMond had studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts de Paris and at the Académie Julian.
Reid received teachings based on the contributions of the great pictorial movements and his art is influenced by French impressionists like Edouard Manet, whose simplification of forms he appreciated. As Amanda Apostol said he also refers to the Nabis and particularly Edouard Vuillard, Pierre Bonnard, and Toulouse Lautrec, who Reid also counts among his favorite painters. He took from them the use of pure colors for half and midtones values, and the absence of a center of interest.

Reid was also influenced by American post-impressionists such as John Singer Sargent, Winslow Homer and the more contemporary Fairfield Porter, Andrew Wyeth and Joan Mitchell.

While on his honeymoon in Madeira, he met George Jacobs (1926-2002) who colored pen and ink drawings with watercolor. George Jacob's method of painting with watercolor relies heavily on pen lines. In this early period they took daily van trips, painting street scenes and landscapes with Reid first copying Jacobs' style.

When Reid came back to the US in 1964, at twenty-seven he took a job teaching at the Famous Artists School becoming the youngest instructor employed there. At the time, there had been no watercolor instruction. At the end of 4 years, he was asked to set up a figure class in watercolor with no experience other than the month with George Jacobs. His supervisor, Frank Jones, gave him a brief demonstration of a tugboat, highlighting the wet-in-wet technique, and in how to deal with his edges to improve his watercolor technique. That was enough to help create this weekly figure class.

He taught for 10 years at the correspondence school, and he spent each day at the easel. This work served as the basis for his first book "Figure Painting in Watercolor". Its publication in 1973 put him in the forefront of people's mind as a watercolorist.

Charles Reid found inspiration in the fashion illustrations of Dorothy Hood, which he admired for her direct and simple style.

In the late 70's and 80's he traveled a great deal and spent time in airports where he developed his contour drawing skill by drawing fellow passengers waiting for flights.

His work was simple and direct. For portraits he used contour drawings to connect the figure to the background. As a pupil of F. Reilly he focused his works on drawing and usage of perfecting tonal value in his painting.

In the book by JM Parramon, "Creative Watercolor", the author set out the technical elements that establish the singularity of Charles Reid's style. The contour-drawing and his way of applying the color. According to Parramon his paintings show how he "associates the precision of the form to the ease of the line and the color".

His watercolor technique was unconventional. He painted from mid-darks to lights rather than starting light and going dark. He used alla-prima approach, and didn't glaze, which is the traditional way to paint watercolor. He only glazed sometimes for the features of the figures.

Charles Reid perceived still life in an abstract way, seeing large splot of light and dark. Then he put paint as a diagram of colors in order to establish the color combination of his painting.

He painted directly onto paper, with the intention of getting the right value and color on the first try. This contributes to the sense of spontaneity and freshness to his work. Although not necessarily happy with mistakes, he considered them to be essential in retaining a sense of freshness, suggesting things are "alive".

Contrary to what his style suggests, he worked in a meticulous manner avoiding overworking, each brushstroke counts, and he deals with edges. He considers painting a "happening", like jazz. To "American Artist" he said, "The more you know the more you can improvise". He starts each painting like a new experience, pretending he does not know how to paint.

He looked at his watercolors more as poems that are completed after an hour or two, whereas his oils were like novels that required a more detailed depiction of the scene. Reid was a studio painter and a plein-air painter, but he tended to prefer the warmth of the south light, thinking it worked well for him.

On March 18, 1972, Reid was the first to design an 8 cent US Postal Service stamp that highlighted Family Planning, issued in New York City. It's a vertical stamp showing a family group (husband, wife, daughter and son) walking forward. His inspiration for the painting came from a family photograph.

He painted the illustration for the L.L. Bean Maine Hunting Boot, which has been widely used in advertising in their catalogs, on truck sides and on large cubes throughout stores. The painting also appears on the cover of "The Making of an American Icon" by Leon Gorman about his experience as the grandson of the founder of L.L. Bean.

He illustrated a limited edition of John Steinbeck's "The Grapes Of Wrath" published in 1978 by Franklin Library. 

Further collaborations appeared in "American Heritage", "Harper's", "Sports Afield", "Reader's Digest Books" and the "Franklin Press."

As a teacher, Reid hosted fifteen to twenty workshops a year over thirty-five to forty years. He wrote twelve books, eleven of which are about watercolor. He made nine instructional DVDs:


He judged in numerous painting exhibitions as well.

Barrington Tops is a plateau that stretches between two peaks of the "Mount Royal Ranges", part of the Great Dividing Range. It also forms the watershed between the Hunter and Manning Rivers. Barrington Tops sits on top of a volcano and reaches an altitude of 1586 m.

At 3 December 1969 the region between "Mount Barrington", "Mount Royal" and the "Gloucester Tops was" declared a national park. Since 1982 the park has been listed as part of the Gondwana rainforests of Australia as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; as such, it is the southernmost of the affiliated national parks.

The Barrington Tops area was home to various Aboriginal countries, namely the "Worimi" and "Biripi" in the east and the "Wonnarua" in the west.

From around 1820, European settlers began to settle in the region, using the areas to cut logs and as grazing land for cattle. Gold was also searched here.

In the early 20th In the 19th century, tourism became popular through horse riding, hunting and fishing. "The Barrington Club", founded in 1948, campaigned for nature conservation. In 1959 the first areas were placed under protection.

The park includes ecosystems of tropical rainforest in the protected valleys and gorges at heights between 400 and 600 m. At altitudes of 700 to 1400 m there is cool temperate rainforest, where "Nothofagus moorei" predominates. This is followed by an alpine zone with alpine woodland and subalpine peat bogs in the summit regions.

Eucalyptus forests with various species predominate across all heights: Sydney and Messmate eucalyptus dominate the valleys and on the slopes, and the southern beech also dominates the higher areas. On the other hand, the cold-resistant snow eucalyptus predominates on the plateau.

Thanks to the remote, inaccessible location of the park, a diverse fauna including some species that have already been considered extinct has been preserved. A butterfly, three spider species, three worm species and the crustacean "Crenoicus harrisoni" are endemic to the park.

Eastern gray kangaroos, red-necked wallabies, red-necked filanders and bare-nosed wombats also occur. Nocturnal mammals are also present. Echidna and platypus also find their habitat here. The koala is difficult to observe, the Australian mouse "Pseudomys oralis is a critically" endangered species. The Australian wide-toothed rat occurs only in a few places in Australia.

Birds include lyre-tails, cockatoos, flat-tailed parakeets, kookaburras, strangler crows and grouse . The black cockatoo is rarely seen. The most common reptiles encounted here are the black otter, tiger otter, copper-headed snake and brown snake .

The 38.76 km² Berowra Valley National Park lies between the suburbs of Hornsby Heights, Thornleigh, Galston, Pennant Hills and Cherrybrook. The Berowra River Regional Park connects to the south. To the east is the Ku-ring-gai-Chase National Park and to the north is the Marramarra National Park .

The national park is criss-crossed by valleys with bushes in which eucalyptus and banksia grow. There are 70 in the national park kilometres of hiking trails. The "Great North Way", which can be hiked 250 kilometres from Sydney to Newcastle, runs 25 kilometres through the national park.

Heathcote National Park

Heathcote National Park is a national park in east New South Wales, and about 34 km southwest of Sydney. The park is west of the Royal National Park near the suburbs of "Heathcote" and "Waterfall".

The park is 22.5 km² eucalyptus forest. Private vehicles may not enter. Walkers go in through the entrance on "Freeman Road" in Heathcote. A trail begins behind the Boy Scout Hall on Freeman Road. It goes south past water holes and small waterfalls. The path ends at the Woronora Dam, although there are several other entrances to the park around Heathcote and Waterfall.

Before the forest area became a park, a group of hikers had leased most of the area. Presumably they created some of the early hiking trails and campsites. The area later became a "state park" and again later a national park.

Aboriginals lived in the area and left traces in various places. In addition, a number of European settlers lived during the Great Depression in the 1930s in simple huts, leaving only scant ruins in places like "Myuna Creek" back 

The park consists of the deeply furrowed Hawkesbury sandstone plateau, part of the <nowiki>" Woronora Plateau "</nowiki>. "Heathcote Creek", a tributary of the Woronora River, is found in a gorge. The sandstone is about 200 million Years old and has been around for around 94 million Years ago. After each period of land uplift, the watercourses dug into the sandstone. Heathcote Creek tumbles down some waterfalls to the Woronora River on the north edge of the park.

The hills and arid slopes are covered with forests dominated by "angophora" and eucalyptus. Grass trees are common. The undergrowth consists of bushes such as "banksia", "hakea" and wax flowers. "Doryanthes excelsa" and "Allocasuarina torulosa" grow on more humid slopes. "Eucalyptus patens" and Grevillings grow in the valley of Heathcote Creek.

Short-headed glide pouches, common ring pouches and probably also eastern pygmy possums live on "Mirang Creek" and in "Minda Gully". There are also swamp wallabies. Often you can also see honey-eaters and gray-backed lyre tails.


Werakata National Park

Werakata National Park is a national park in the east of the Australian state of New South Wales, 115 km north of Sydney, in the Hunter River region The park is divided into three parts, which are to the northeast, east and southeast of the city of Cessnock. 

South of the park is the separate "Werakata State Conservation Area". 

Werakata National Park was opened on 26. February 1999 from a 1130 acres of "Cessnock State Forest" (State Forest No. 874) formed. On the 1st January 2003 came another 478 acres from the state forest, as well as the "Aberdare State Forest" (State Forest No. 981) with 531 hectares.

The "Werakata State Conservation Area" with 2257 hectare area was created in 2007.

The Hunter River area was inhabited by the Aboriginal countries of "Awabakal", "Worimi", "Wonnarua", "Geawegal", "Birripai" and "Darkinjung", but little is known about their use of the land near what is now the national park after European settlement in the 19th century. In the 19th century, forestry was practiced and sawmills were built in and near today's park. Most of the wood was used to expand the mines in the area. In 1942, the Cessnock State Forest was established as a sanctuary, followed by the Aberdare State Forest in 1963. The logging continued until it was rededicated in the national park. 

Before the establishment of the national park, it was found that the predominant eucalyptus species "Spotted Gum" ("Corymbia maculata") was still underrepresented in the system of protected areas.

Various endangered animal species can also be found in the park.

Pithecopus centralis

The Mato Grasso leaf frog ("Pithecopus centralis") is a frog that lives in Mato Grasso in Brazil. People have seen it higher than 520 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in drier places than other frogs: grasslands with many rocks. The male frogs have been heard calling near streams. This frog lays eggs during the time of year when the weather is drier.

Scientists think this frog is in some danger of dying out because the place it lives is not very big and because human beings continue to change it in ways that are not good for the frog. For example, the frog is now extinct in some parts of Brazil because people built an artificial lake to store drinking water and flooded the place where the frogs lived.

Condemned property

A condemned property (also called a condemned building) is any house, commercial property, business, apartment, townhouse, educational place (school, college) jail/prison, law enforcement or government property that is marked as unfit or not suitable for being occupied, being used or operated. A large number of properties are also condemned for being unsafe, illegal or fire-damaged. Most are dilapidated (badly damaged), deteriorated (run down, decayed), are infested by vermin/rodents or loaded with filthy conditions (excrement, spoiled food/drinks or dirt/mud across several parts of any place that is occupied). Tropical cyclone, flood, lightning or tornado damage often also leads to the condemnation of properties.

Other conditions for which a building may be condemned involve places being boarded, having utilities disconnected or having dangerous materials, methamphetamine making labs or any dangerous locations.
Utilities are hot water, good-to-excellent heating systems working, good-to-excellent plumbing and having a safe reliable electrical outlet. Some places are condemned for vehicles parked in a yard, vehicles that are classified as not operable, having dangerous conditions.

Condemned warnings or notices (also called as placards) are usually posted onto the properties in question. They forbid when people occupy, enter or use these buildings when not authorized for doing so. Anyone other than code officials, the property inspectors or area health department officials entering, occupying or using any condemned premises, defacing or removing condemned notices/warnings are subject to fines, jail time or both. Notices of violation are often posted with the condemned notices and warnings.

New York City, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Chicago, Quad Cities (most likely Rock Island, Moline and Davenport), Baltimore, Detroit and Los Angeles have higher numbers of condemned, abandoned and vacant homes, buildings or schools unlike several other mid-size/small and some large cities or towns in Canada and the United States.

Condemned properties are usually renovated. Many other condemned buildings or homes, however, are demolished due to their conditions.

History of Albania

The history of Albania forms a part of the history of Europe. During Classical Antiquity, several Illyrian tribes lived in Albania. They were the Ardiaei, Albanoi, Amantini, Enchele and Taulantii. There were also Thracian and Greek tribes, as well as several Greek colonies established on the Illyrian coast.

In the 3rd century BC, Rome conquered the area. It became part of the Roman provinces of Dalmatia, Macedonia and Moesia Superior. The territory remained under Roman and Byzantine control until the Slavic migrations of the 7th century. The Bulgarian Empire conquered it in the 9th century.
The Principality of Arbër and a Sicilian union known as the medieval Kingdom of Albania were established in the Middle Ages. Some areas became part of the Venetian and later Serbian Empire. Between the mid-14th and the late 15th centuries, most of modern-day Albania was dominated by Albanian principalities. They fell to the rapid invasion of the Ottoman Empire. Albania remained under Ottoman control as part of the province of Rumelia until 1912. After a short occupation by the Kingdom of Serbia, the first independent Albanian state was founded by the Albanian Declaration of Independence. An Albanian national consciousness was formed in the later 19th century. It is part of the larger phenomenon of the rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire.

The short-lived Principality of Albania (1914–1925) was succeeded by an even shorter-lived first Albanian Republic (1925–1928). Another monarchy, the Kingdom of Albania (1928–1939), replaced the republic. The country endured occupation by Italy just before World War II. After the collapse of the Axis powers, Albania became the Socialist People's Republic of Albania. It was a communist state. Enver Hoxha governed it most of its duration (died 1985). his political succesor Ramiz Alia oversaw the disintegration of the communist state. This happened during the wider collapse of the Eastern Bloc in the later 1980s.

The communist regime collapsed in 1990. The former communist Party of Labour of Albania was defeated in elections in March 1992, amid economic collapse and social unrest. The unstable economic situation led to an Albanian diaspora during the 1990s. The crisis peaked in the Albanian Turmoil of 1997. Albania was able to join the NATO in 2009 thanks to the improved economic and political conditions. The country is applying to join the European Union.


Walls of Jerusalem National Park

The Walls of Jerusalem National Park is located in the centre of Tasmania. The park has a size of about 518 km² and was founded June 1981. It has been part of the Tasmanian Wilderness UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1982 and is on both the cultural and natural heritage lists. This is where King Davids Peak is located.

The park takes its name from geological formations that resemble the walls of the city of Jerusalem in Israel. Therefore, many places and formations in the park are named after places in the Bible like  Herod's Gate, Salome Lake, Solomon's Jewels and Damascus Gate.

Like much of the Tasmanian wilderness, the area is not very accessible by roads and the only road leading into the park is through the C171 road. It is only accessible to experienced hikers ("bushwalkers") or skiers who, because of the often very changeable weather, have to be very careful and take appropriate precautionary measures, about which the Parks & Wildlife Service provides comprehensive information. 

The national park is characterised above all by its alpine vegetation with endemic coniferous forests and upholstered heather stands. In fire-protected areas, stands of cypress-like scale spruce can be found. The landscape of the area is characterised by Ice Age moraines and glacier lakes.


History of Andorra

Andorra, officially the Principality of Andorra (), is a microstate located in the eastern Pyrenees mountains and bordered by Spain and France.

Andorra claims it is the last independent survivor of the Marca Hispanica. This was the buffer states created by Charlemagne to keep the Islamic Moors from advancing into Christian France. According to the tradition, Charlemagne granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting the Moors. In the 9th century, Charlemagne's grandson, Charles the Bald, named the Count of Urgell as overlord of Andorra. A descendant of the count later gave the lands to the Diocese of Urgell.

In the 11th century, the Bishop of Urgell placed himself under the protection of the Lord of Caboet, a Catalan nobleman. Later, the Count of Foix became heir to the Lord of Caboet through marriage in 1208. A dispute arose between the Occitan Count and the Catalan bishop over Andorra.

In 1278, the conflict was resolved by the signing of a pareage (pariatges). This stated that Andorra's sovereignty was shared between the Count of Foix and the Bishop of La Seu d'Urgell (Catalonia). The pareage gave the small state its territory and political form. In return, Andorra pays an annual tribute or questia to the co-rulers consisting of four hams, forty loaves of bread, and some wine. Andorra's borders have remained unchanged since 1278.

Andorra was briefly annexed to the Crown of Aragon twice, in 1396 and 1512.

Royal National Park

The Royal National Park is a national park in New South Wales of Australia. It is located 29 kilometres south of Sydney and is part of the Sydney metropolitan area.

The national park was founded in 1879 by Sir John Robertson, then premier of New South Wales, making it the second oldest national park in the world after Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Sir John Robertson cared for and supported him all the rest of his life. After coal was discovered on the terrain, it was founded out of economic interests to keep competition away from the gates of Sydney. Its original name was "The National Park" . In 1955 it was renamed after a visit from Queen Elizabeth II. The park is repeatedly ravaged by bushfires, which contribute to the constant change and regeneration of the vegetation. Plants like the native Waratah are adapted to the environmental factor fire and need the fires to bloom in subsequent years.

The park is partly in the Sydney and Wollongong administrative districts and forms a jewel with unspoiled nature between these two major cities. It is bounded to the north by the Port Hacking fjord, to the west by the motorway between the cities and to the south to Otford. The Heathcote National Park connects across the freeway and continues the green belt around Sydney.

The Royal National Park offers very different landscapes and vegetation. It lies on sandstone hills that break off a few hundred meters down to the coast. They are mostly covered by eucalyptus forests with a wealth of species. Centrally, deeply cut, the Hacking River runs through the park, which flows into the seawater of Port Hacking at Audley. This rugged bay offers protection from the open sea. The water at Bundeena is very shallow and is home to an extensive mangrove forest . There are a few beaches and lagoons on the open coast to the Tasman Sea. Most of them can only be reached on foot via the coastal footpath. Wattamolla can be approached and offers ample picnic and barbecue facilities. In the southeast the forest merges into the subtropical rainforest of the Illawarra Escarpment, in which there are also palm trees.

Access by car is via three routes, north from Sutherland, west from Waterfall and south from Otford via Stanwell Park . A daily or annual fee is required, which can be purchased at various points of sale as well as on NSW national parks website.


Pithecopus megacephalus

The large-headed leaf frog ("Pithecopus megacephalus") is a frog that lives in Brazil. Scientists have seen it 800 meters above sea level in the Espinaço Mountains.

Ecclesiastical court

There are different movements in Christianity. Over time, each of these movements developed a number of rules to follow. An ecclesiastical court is a court of law that only uses one of these sets of rules to judge people. In the case of the Roman Catholic Church, these rules are known as Canon law, and they can be found in the Codex Iuris Canonici.

Flinders Chase National Park

Flinders Chase National Park is a national park in South Australia in Kangaroo Island south of Adelaide. The park has a size of 326 km² and is distributed over the three areas; Cape du Couedic and Rocky River, Gosse Lands and the Cape Borda Lighthouse in the west of the island. The park was founded in 1919. The closest town is Kingscote, about 110 km away.

The main attractions of the park are the bizarre rocks of the "Remarkable Rocks", the colonies of fur seals at "Admirals Arch", and the lighthouse at Cape Borda from 1858. There are also numerous kangaroos and koalas in the park.

New Zealand fur seals, Australian fur seals and Australian sea lions can be found along the coast of the park. Showy land mammals are kangaroos, which are represented by two species. On the one hand by a special island subspecies of the western grey giant kangaroo and on the other hand by the derby wallaby . A purely endemic terrestrial mammal species found nowhere else on the island is the Kangaroo Island narrow-footed pouch mouse . At other mammals come koalas, platypus, pseudocheiridae, common brushtail possum, Small short-nosed bandicoot "(Isodon oesulus obesulus)," Tasmanian cercartetus, thin tail cercartetus, swamp rats "(Rattus lutreolus)," also a subspecies of the Australian bush rat "(Rattus fuscipes greyi)" and a special island subspecies of the short-billed hedgehog. In addition, eight species of bats live in the park.

The koalas, platypus and ring-baggers were introduced from mainland Australia. The number of koalas has increased so much in recent years that many eucalyptus forests have been severely damaged. The national park administration tries to cope with the situation with sterilisation programs. In the national park there are also some species that do not belong to the original Australian fauna. These are goats, fallow deer, pigs, house cats, house rats and house mice .

The kangaroo island emu was once endemic to the island, but in the 19th Century extinct. Reptiles are represented by Rosenberg's monitor lizard, dwarf copper head, black tiger otter, striped fin foot, various skinks, geckos and an agame ("Ctenophorus decresii"). Six species of frog are at home in the park. The leatherback turtle is found on the coasts.

At 6 December 2007, lightning bolts ignited a bushfire in which 19,542 ha bush burned in the national park. This corresponds to 60% of the total area.

Even bigger fires raged over the turn of the 2019/2020 bushfire season, which destroyed around a quarter in the west of the island. The bushfires also largely destroyed Flinders Chase National Park, including the visitor centre. Much of the rare wildlife was also a victim of the flames.


Hemings family

The Hemings family was a group of people who lived in Virginia. They were Elizabeth Hemings and her children and other descendants. They were enslaved people, meaning some of their ancestors had been kidnapped in Africa and brought over the Atlantic Ocean in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Some of them became free later. For part of their history, they were enslaved to the Eppes family, to the Wayles family, and to Thomas Jefferson. The Hemingses were the largest family to live at Monticello.

According to Elizabeth Hemings' grandson, Madison Hemings, her mother was a fully African woman and might have been born in Africa. She was enslaved to the Eppes family in Virginia. Historians do not know for sure what her name was. Papers with the names of enslaved women in the Eppes family include "Dinah," "Judy," "Abbie," "Sarah," "Parthenia," and others. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed said that there were many girls named "Thenia" in the Hemings family, and they might have been named after Parthenia, also spelled Parthena. But she also says that "Sally" is a nickname for "Sarah," and there were many girls named "Sarah" and "Sally" in the Hemings family too.

Madison Hemings told the story: Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman and her father was an English sea captain named Hemings. The sea captain tried to buy Elizabeth Hemings from her owner when she was born. Even though he offered the owner a large amount of money, the owner still said no. He said he wanted to see what a half-white, half-African child would look like. Then Captain Hemings tried to take the child away from the owner without paying, but someone told the owner about his plan. Captain Hemings left Virginia and did not come back.

Captain Hemings tried to take his daughter from one of the men in the Eppes family, but historians do not know which one because they do not know when Elizabeth Hemings was born. One paper says "about 1735."

Elizabeth Hemings lived at the Eppes family's house, which was called Bermuda Hundred until 1746. That year, Martha Eppes married John Wayles. Elizabeth and other enslaved people went with Martha to Wayle's house as part of her marriage settlement. A marriage settlement was any property that a married woman could control and her husband couldn't. Technically, the Eppes family owned Elizabeth Hemings.

Elizabeth Hemings lived as a house servant. That means she did not grow tobacco or cotton in the fields like other enslaved people in Virginia did. Historians think that Elizabeth Hemings' job with the Wayles family was to help raise Martha Wayles, later Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson. After Johyn Wayles' wife died, he made Elizabeth Hemings his concubine, which means they had a sexual relationship but he did not free her or marry her. Historians do not know how Elizabeth Hemings felt about this.

When Martha Wayles Skelton married Thomas Jefferson, Hemings and many people in her family went with Martha Skelton to Jefferson's house at Monticello. Historians think Elizabeth Hemings took care of Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson when she became sick and that she was there when she died.

The Hemingses were known for pooling resources. That means that if one of them had money or other good things, they would share it with the others. They also had what historian Annette Gordon-Reed calls a "mania" for naming their children after each other. A mother would name her children after her own sisters or brothers.

Thomas Jefferson wrote a lot, so historians know more about the Hemingses who lived on Monticello than about many other enslaved people. We know that six of Elizabeth Hemings' children were Martha Jefferson's half-brothers and half-sisters because they had the same father: John Wayles. We do not know what Martha Jefferson or the Hemingses thought about this. We do know that Robert and James Hemings helped Martha Jefferson and her daughters escape from British soldiers during the Revolutionary War. We do not know whether the Hemings men thought of themselves as two men helping their sister and nieces, as two men helping their master's wife and daughters, as both, or as neither one.

Thomas Jefferson trusted many people in the Hemings family. When he was away from Monticello, he would allow the Hemings men to leave, choose other people for whom to work, and keep all their money. The law of Virginia at the time said he did not have to do this. Jefferson freed several people in the Hemings family. He did not get along with all the Hemingses. He had a fight with Martin Hemings.

Jefferson was not always happy to free enslaved people. When Robert Hemings asked to make a deal with Jefferson for his freedom, Jefferson was not happy about it. He said that Robert had been lured away from him. After freeing Robert, Jefferson stopped letting his enslaved people travel so much. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed writes that she thinks Jefferson figured out that letting enslaved people live as if they were free made them want to be free for real. It also let them learn things about the outside world.

Savitribai Phule

Savitribai Phule (3 January 1831 – 10 March 1897) was a social reformer of India. She was a poet from Maharashtra. She is known as the "first female teacher of India". She worked on improving the rights of women in India with her husband. Her husband's name was Jyotirao Phule. They started the first Indian girls school in Pune, at Bhide wada in 1848. She tried to end social class and unfair treatment based on sex in Indian society. She was an important person of the social reform in Maharashtra.

Savitribai Phule was born on 3 January 1831 in the village of Naigaon in Satara District, Maharashtra. Her birthplace was about from Shirval and about from Pune. Savitribai Phule was the oldest daughter of Lakshmi (her mother) and Khandoji Nevase Patil (her father). They were from the Mali Community. Savitribai and Jotirao did not have any children of their own. It is said that they took Yashawant in their family. Yashawant was the son of a Brahmin woman whose husband had died.

At the time of marriage, Savitribai was not able to read or write. Jyotirao taught Savitribai at their home.<ref name="O'Hanlon 2002 https://archive.org/details/casteconflictide00ohan/page/n131 118"></ref> She completed her primary education with Jyotirao. She registered herself in two training programs to become a teacher. Later, Savitribai Phule started teaching girls at the Maharwada in Pune. Soon Savitribai and with Sagunabai started their own school at Bhide Wada. Sagunabai was a coach of Jyotirao Phule. Tatya Saheb Bhide was inspired by these works. School course at Bhide Wada included traditional western course of mathematics, science, and social studies. By the end of 1851, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were running three different schools for girls in Pune. These three schools had almost one hundred and fifty students registered. Teaching of these three schools was better than government schools. As a result of this, the number of girls in these schools went up to the number of boys in government schools.

Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule's success came with much oppose. The opposers were the persons who did not like change. The Phules faced strong opposition from powerful castes (Brahmin) because they belonged to the week caste (Mali). Education was not for the Sudra castes for thousands of years. For this reason, Brahmins started to oppose works of Jyotirao and Savitribai. Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were living at home of father of Jyotirao til 1849. Father of Jyotirao asked them to leave his home In 1849 because their work was a sin as per the Manusmriti and Brahmanical texts.

They moved in the family of Usman Sheikh. Usman Sheikh was a friend of Jyotirao. In the 1850s, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule established two educational trusts - The Native Female School, Pune and the Society for Promoting the Education of Mahars, Mangs, and Etceteras. These two trusts had many schools of Savitribai Phule.

Jyotirao talked about Savitribai and his work in an interview. This interview was given to the Christian missionary periodical, Dnyanodaya, on 15 September 1853. He said

She taught children from different castes. She opened a total of 18 schools with her husband. They also opened a care centre called Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha (literally, "Child-killing Prohibition Home") for pregnant rape victims. Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha helped deliver and save their children.

Savitribai and her adopted son, Yashwant, opened a clinic. This clinic was for the victims of an outbreak of the bubonic plague (Third Pandemic). The clinic was in Pune. Savitribai died a heroic death. She tried to save the son of Pandurang Babaji Gaekwad. She came to know that Gaekwad's son had got the plague. Savitribai Phule ran to him. She carried him on her back to the hospital. In the process, she was infected. She died at 9:00pm on 10 March 1897.

Indian Women's League

The Indian Women's League is the top level in the women's professional football league system in India. The first season started in Cuttack in October 2016. The league is run by the All India Football Federation (AIFF).

Since 1991, the top women's football tournament in India has been the Indian Women's Football Championship. The tournament served as a female version of the Santosh Trophy, with states competing against each other. There had never been a national football league for women; however, leagues were started by state associations for women. The first women's state football league was set up in 1976 in Manipur. The Indian Football Association of West Bengal founded the Calcutta Women's League in 1993. Leagues were also started in Mumbai and Goa in 1998 and 1999.

In 2014, after the success of the India women's team, mainly in the SAFF Women's Championship, a push to start a women's football league, mainly along the lines of the successful Indian Super League, started. Clubs such as Pune and Bengaluru FC had interest in joining a women's league. It was around this time that the All India Football Federation started plans to create the ISL-style league for women.

On 21 April 2016, over a year after the AIFF made plans for a women's football league, the AIFF President, Praful Patel, said that a women's football league would start in October 2016 with six teams to be decided, with the goal to expand to eight teams by 2017. Just over two months later, on 5 July 2016, the AIFF organized a meeting to discuss the India women's national team and discuss the proposed women's football league. Five Indian Super League sides (Delhi Dynamos, Chennaiyin FC, Kerala Blasters, FC Pune City, Atletico de Kolkata) and three I-League teams (Bengaluru FC, Aizawl FC, Mumbai FC) attended the meeting. It was declared that the league would feature the eight teams in the league and two other spots would be decided through a pre-qualification round.

On 14 October, the AIFF declared that the preliminary rounds for the Women's League would begin on 17 October 2016 in which ten teams would split into two groups of five teams each, with the winner from each group qualifying for the national finals.

On 24 January 2017, AIFF began the first ever women's professional league with six teams. The participating teams – FC Alakhpura (Haryana), Jeppiaar Institute of Technology FC (Puducherry), Aizawl FC (Women) (Mizoram), FC Pune City (women) (Maharashtra), Rising Student's Club (Odisha) and Eastern Sporting Union (Manipur) played each other in a round-robin format with the top four teams going to the semifinals. All matches of the two-week Indian Women's League (IWL) were played at Delhi's Ambedkar Stadium with the first match played on Saturday, January 28.

The final round of the season was played at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Shillong. Rising Student's Club from Odisha were crowned champions after beating Eastern Sporting Union.

The Indian Women's League season 3 main round started on 5 May 2019. All matches to be played in Guru Nanak Stadium, Ludhiana, Punjab. The 2018–19 IWL will have 12 teams, divided into two groups. The teams will play each other once and the top two teams will compete in the semi-final.Sethu FC crowned unbeaten champions

Indian Women's League season 4 main round started on 24 January 2020. All matches were played in Bangalore Football Stadium, Bengaluru, Karnataka. The 2019–20 IWL had 12 teams, divided into two groups. The teams played each other once and the top two teams competed in the semi-final. Gokulam Kerala were crowned champions after beating KRYPHSA F.C. 3–2 in the final.

Northern Alliance

The Northern Alliance, officially the United Islamic National Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan, was an anti-Taliban military alliance of warlords and military commanders against the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in support of the Islamic State of Afghanistan. It was active between 1996 and 2001. It was based in the city of Taloqan, Afghanistan. In 2001, it was reported that a leader of the movement was killed by Taliban fighters. The group was dissolved in 2001 following the September 11 attacks with the United States invading the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in the War in Afghanistan.

Bouddi National Park

The Bouddi National Park is a national park in New South Wales, 44 kilometres northeast of Sydney on the shores of the Pacific Ocean. It is near Broken Bay, the mouth of the Hawkesbury River. Part of this national park also includes the adjacent coastal waters, so that a contiguous habitat on land, on the coast and in the sea is protected. The park also includes "Fletchers Glen", one of the last remaining temperate rainforests on the central stretch of the New South Wales coast.

Originally the park was called "Bouddi Natural Park". It got its name at the second Park Association meeting in 1936. Other names that were under discussion were "Maitland Bay Park", "Cape Three Points Reserve," and "Gerrinbombi Park" . The reason for the choice of the name was the fact that Bouddi was documented as an Aboriginal name for this area, since it appeared in maps from 1828. The park association was formed the year before to administer the park and had members from the "NSW Federation of Bushwalking Clubs" and the "Erina Shire Council".

In 1967 the then 530 hectare park was rededicated as a national park and renamed Bouddi State Park, according to the legislation that had just come into force. Management passed to the NSW National Park and Wildlife Service and shortly thereafter the parks association was transformed into an advisory committee. On the 1st January 1974 the National Park and Wildlife Act dropped the State Park category and the park was renamed Bouddi National Park.


Of Human Bondage (1946 movie)

Of Human Bondage is a 1946 American drama movie. Edmund Goulding directed the movie. It is the second movie made of the 1915 novel of the same name by W. Somerset Maugham. It stars Paul Henreid, Eleanor Parker, Edmund Gwenn, Janis Paige, Patric Knowles, Doris Lloyd, Alexis Smith, Isobel Elsom. Warner Bros. distributed the movie.


Paddy field

When growing semiaquatic plants, such as rice and taro, paddy fields are used. These fields are filled with shallow water at least part of the year. Growing these plants is very labor-intensive. A lot of water is needed. Paddy-fields started next to the Yangtze River in China, in the Neolithic. Later, their use spread to other areas in Asia. Paddy fields are built next to marshes or using terraces, on a hillside.

Deepwater rice is not grown using paddy fields: It needs water over deep for at least a month.

Naracoorte Caves National Park

The Naracoorte Caves National Park is a national park in the southeast of the Australian state of South Australia, 313 km southeast of Adelaide, 83 km north of Mount Gambier and 15 km southeast of Naracoorte. 1994, the area was declared a national park because of its extraordinarily extensive fossil finds and classified together with Riversleigh in Queensland as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The natural world heritage area contains 26 caves on 3.05 km² area.

The park is a tourist attraction and has a campground, RV park, group accommodation, picnic areas and a cafe. The number of sights is huge. Cave tours are offered by trained guides. There you can see caves filled with a large number of interesting fossils. With the help of modern technology, visitors can be shown the inside of the normally inaccessible "Bat Cave", where thousands of bats breed every year. There are also cave tours for adventurers, a number of special tours and special events.

The limestone in the area was formed by corals and other marine life 200 million years ago when it was below sea level and again about 20 million years ago when the land was again below sea level. Since then, groundwater has loosened part of the limestone, creating the caves. These caves, like the "Victoria Fossil Cave" or the "Blanche Cave", are often not far underground and holes opened up that posed dangers to the unwary. This created a remarkable collection of fossils. Mammals and other land creatures fell into the open holes and were unable to escape. The fossils were preserved in banks of earth washed and blown from the surface of the earth. In some places the fossil-bearing layer is up to 20 m thick. Some of these areas will be saved for future exploration when better methods of dating and reconstructing fossil records become available. The fossil traps are particularly important for research into the Australian megafauna.




Heaven Hill

Heaven Hill is a large family-owned distillery in Kentucky. It was started in 1935. It is among the largest producers of alcoholic beverages in the United States. Its is mostly known for producing Bourbon whiskey. Today, it produces different brands of whisky, amongst others Heaven Hill and J.W.Dant. It also produces whiskey for other brands who do not have a distillery of their own. Heaven Hill is the last larger producer of Corn whiskey in the United States. 

Deepwater rice

Deepwater rice is the name for different species of rice that grow in deeper water (of to . These varieties have adaptations that allow them to keep their leaves outside the water: Either they have longer leaves, or they float on top of the water.

More than people in Southeast Asia including Northeastern India rely on deepwater rice for their sustenance. Two adaptations permit the rice to live in deeper water, floating rice and traditional talls. Traditional talls are varieties that are grown at water depths between . They have developed to be taller and have longer leaves than standard rice. Floating rice grows in water deeper than 100 cm through advanced elongation ability. This means when a field where rice is growing floods, accelerated growth in the internodal of the stem allows the plant to keep some of its foliage on top of the water. The "O. s. indica" cultivar is the main type of deepwater rice, although varieties of "O. s. japonica" have been found in Burma and Assam Plains.

Usually, rice is grown in shallow water, using paddy fields.

Oxley Wild Rivers National Park

Oxley Wild Rivers National Park is a national park in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is roughly halfway between Sydney and Brisbane, around 80 km from Dorrigo. Its name comes from the explorer John Oxley, who also crossed this area.

The national park was placed under protection in September 1986. It covers an area of approximately 142,332 hectares. These are several, non-contiguous sub-areas.

The Oxley Wild Rivers National Park borders the Willi Willi National Park.

The national park has an impressive landscape in many areas with deep gorges and high waterfalls. Well known is the Wollomombi Falls, the highest waterfall in New South Wales.

The predominant plant communities are rainforests, dry eucalyptus forests, grassy woodlands and heathland. A total of about 950 plant species have been documented in the park, of which about 35 are considered rare and endangered.

In addition, 55 mammal, 173 bird, 38 reptile and 19 amphibian species have been recorded in the national park.

In addition to the populations of the grey giant kangaroos, the wallaroos or mountain kangaroos and the red-necked filanders, the occurrence of the brush-tailed rock kangaroos, of which around 10,000 are found in the national park, are particularly noteworthy. This is the largest known population anywhere. You can also do this in the park Watch koalas and wombats.

Among the bird species are particularly the birds of prey, including the wedge-tailed eagle on its prey flights, the peregrine falcon, crested kite () and the white-bellied sea eagle.

Introduced animals such as mice and rats as well as feral domestic animals such as horses, goats, cats and dogs can disturb the ecological balance in the park and may be combated by the national park administration.

There are various accommodations, campsites and hiking trails for tourists, some of which are even usable for wheelchair users and open up various viewing platforms.

In 1987 the national park became a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of Australia's Gondwana Rainforests.


Barakee National Park

Barakee National Park is a national park in the east of the Australian state of New South Wales, 257 km north of Sydney and about 110 km west of Port Macquarie. 

The national park is located on the north bank of the Nowendoc River. 

The park has an area of 49.8km and became a national park on January 1 1999.


Willandra National Park

Willandra National Park is a national park in the southwest of the Australian state of New South Wales, 582 km west of Sydney. The park is about 60 km west of the town of Hillston and 170 km northwest of Griffith.

Willandra National Park was established in 1972 and covers an area of approximately 19,385 hectares. It consists of 13.85 km² of flat grassland bounded to "the north by Willandra Creek", which connects the Lachlan River with the Darling River.

The land around the national park is mainly used as extensive pasture for sheep and cattle. Most of the roads in this area are unpaved and become slippery or even impassable even with light rainfall. The climate is semi-arid with very hot summers and cold winters. The park is located on the northern edge of the Riverina plain.

It is believed that Aboriginal colonisation dates back at least 15,000 years. The Willandra Creek was roughly the border between the settlement areas of the "Wiradjuri" in the south and the "Wongaibon" in the north.

The first European settlers came in the 1830s. Initially, the white colonisation by sheep breeders was sparse and allowed the Aborigines to continue their accustomed way of life. But in the 1870s and early 1880s, extensive fencing, building, and river regulation programs began as the first phase of permanent white settlement. In 1894, Willandra became the property of the "London Bank of Melbourne" after the "Whittington Brothers"' corporate empire, who had previously owned the country, collapsed in the economic crisis of the 1890s. Under the management of "Arthur" and "Frank Laird", Willandra became a well-known sheep breeding area in the years that followed and the owners won many awards for the high quality of their Merino herds.

In 1912 Willandra was sold to the "Vickery Partnership" and peaked as a ranching company in the 1920s and 1930s. Up to 90,000 sheep were sheared at once and the land area of the farm reached 1760 km². A new manor house (which still stands today and is available as a guest house) was added in 1918. In the following years more buildings were added. The estate had a tennis court, a croquet court and orchards and has thus become - to this day - a remarkable oasis in an otherwise dry and dusty landscape.

Despite high wool prices in the 1950s, Willandra's decline as a well-known cattle breeding business began, which was exacerbated by a long drought after WWII. In 1960, the "New Zealand and Australian Land Company" bought Willandra and the estate's land area decreased to 721 km². For a while, however, the success came back and the company employed up to 22 people.

1969 bought "Dalgety Plc." the estate but failed to renew the land leases when they expired in 1971. With the expiry of the leases, the government of New South Wales withdrew the permission to use the crown land and made the area a national park in 1972. The reserve was then managed by the "NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service" (now part of the "Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water" ). In a major renovation program at the end of the 1990s, the buildings were restored to their old splendor and are now partly used as guest houses.

The park is very level with only a few elevations. For the most part, it is grassland with trees just along the watercourses and around normally dry lakes and valleys. The predominant plant communities are dry eucalyptus forests and grass-rich, light forests. The light forest is dominated by eucalyptus ( "Black Box", Eucalyptus largiflorens) and acacias ( "River Cooba", Acacia stenophylla). Naturally occurring tree and shrub species that characterize the area include the pittosporum (Pittosporum phylliraeoides), Rosewood (Heterodendrum oleifolium) Hakea leucoptera and Senna eremophila.

Before European colonisation began, logs, cotton bushes (Maireana aphylla) and native grasses were probably the most common forms of covering on the plains. Over 100 years of pasture and improvements for sheep breeding have changed this and the plant and animal communities no longer show the conditions as they were before the European settlement. Still, Willandra is an important habitat for many native species, such as the emu, the threatened "Plain hikers," red and gray kangaroos, the echidna, the platypus, nine bat species and 23 reptile species, such as the "Gould's Sand Goanna" and the "Mulga Brown Snake." 


Brisbane Water National Park

Brisbane Water National Park is a national park in the east of the Australian state of New South Wales, 47 kilometres northeast of Sydney. It lies north of the mouth of the Hawkesbury River and was named after the "Brisbane Water" lagoon between Gosford and "Woy Woy", which borders the park to the east. The western and northern borders are formed by the Pacific Highway.

The park consists of steep sandstone cliffs overgrown with forest.

There are many hiking trails in the park that can be classified from easy to difficult. One route that is easily accessible by public transport is to "Pindar Cave" on the rock step above "Wondabyne" Station, a on-demand stop on the "Central Coast Railway Line" (Sydney-Newcastle) which is also the only train station in Australia inaccessible by road. This large park is also home to many other hiking trails such as the "Great North Walk".


Extrajudicial killing

An extrajudicial killing (or extralegal killing) is the killing of a person without waiting for the result of a state trial. Extrajudicial killings happen in states which either have laws favoring them, or where the state condones the killing. An example might be that someone is suspected of having done something which dishonors the family. Killing the person might be a way to keep the family in good standing (This is known as honor killing). The state might have laws that do not see this as murder, so the killers will not get a harsh sentence, or they will go unpunished altogether.

Brewarrina Aboriginal Fish Traps

The Brewarrina fish traps (Also known as "Baiames Ngunnhu") are located in the town of Brewarrina on the Barwon River in the north west of New South Wales, around 800 km northwest of Sydney. It is the largest known Aboriginal fish trap facility in Australia. It is believed to be the oldest human construction in the world although it hasn't been confirmed yet.

The fish traps are probably around 40,000 years old, although the exact date is not known. They are around 500 m long. They are in the Ngunnhu Aboriginal territory. The fish traps consisted of many small stone circles that could be separated by stone weirs. There the fish were led so that they could be caught. The design, complexity and size of the facility are unique in Australia. For this reason they are a national monument.

Before the European settlement, the Aboriginals used the river for fishing. Stones were removed from the river by the settlers to allow paddle steamers to travel, and rocks were removed in the 1920s to be used for house foundations and roads. The steamships could not sail in the dry season.

The Ngunnhu people had strong social, cultural and spiritual relationships with other Aboriginal groups, and they also allowed other Aboriginal countries to fish according to rules, times and periods. They were associated with the Aborigines of the Kamilaroi, Marowari, Paarkinji, Weilwan, Barbinja and Ualaria. The neighbouring Aboriginal countries were invited by Ngunnhu to cooroborees, ceremonies, initiations, trade and barter.

The Ngunnhu attribute the possibility of fishing to the mythical Baiame, a dreamtime creature who created the landscape, lakes, rivers and beings. 

The plant is partly overgrown by reeds. The fish ladder was opened on June 3 2005 registered in the Australian National Heritage List because it was of particular historical importance for the social and cultural coexistence within the Aboriginals.


Pithecopus rusticus

Pithecopus rusticus is a frog that lives in Brazil. People have seen it 1330 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in grassy places in the forests on the Atlantic side (east side) of Brazil.

Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out because it lives in such a small place: They found it on private property in 2019. After the owner removed the grassy places, scientists could not find the frog again. Scientists think this frog might be dying because of the fungal disease chytridiomycosis and because human beings change the places where it lives. Some people may catch the frogs to sell as pets.

Scientists believe this frog lays eggs on leaves over water and the tadpoles drop into the water after they hatch.

Darlington Probation Station

The historic Darlington Probation Station is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located on Maria Island off the east coast of Tasmania, Australia. The camp is in the northwest of the island on "Darling Bay" in Maria Island National Park, where the former Darlington settlement was located. Since 1825 there was a camp on the island for prisoners who had committed serious crimes. From 1842 to 1850 it was operated as one of two British penal camps, alongside the Cascades Female Factory, as an education camp.
In 1825, the second convict colony in Van Diemens Land (now renamed as Tasmania) was established by Governor George Arthur with 50 convicts and a few soldiers on Maria Island, which was closed again in 1832. Despite the short time, several buildings were built, of which the "Commissariat Store" and the constructions of the convict camp, known as the "Penitentiary", have been preserved.

The convicts built a wood, shoe and clothes maker manufacture and tannery. The construction of a mechanised, water-powered clothing manufacture was remarkable. Because of several escape attempts and disciplinary problems, this penal colony was closed in 1832. The Port Arthur prison, which has now been established and could accommodate a large number of convicts, also played a role.

Ten years later, the penal colony was reopened as a prison camp on the initiative of Lieutenant Governor Franklin in 1842, after repairing the existing buildings. When a second station opened, more than 800 convicts came to the island and more buildings were erected. Overcrowding created numerous problems and the stations were closed in 1850.

Among the convicts was the Irish nationalist from the Young Ireland movement William Smith O'Brien, two Khoikhoi and five Maori who were detained there because of national conflicts over borders.
The camp has been in operation since 1 Registered in the Australian National Heritage List on August 1, 2007 and in, August 2010; one of eleven Australian Convict Sites recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

The accommodation station is one of the best preserved prison camp buildings from the early days of the Australian convict colony. There were 78 such camps in Tasmania. There are 13 buildings on Maria Island, some of which have been preserved and some of which are ruins.

The buildings on the island reflect the system of labour discipline for convicts in the early British colonial times. In the convict camp there were strict rules and discipline with division into groups and according to training, the exercise of religious coercion and methods of rigid punishment. The "Darlington Probation Station" with this form of convict discipline with public work goes back to Franklin (1837 to 1843).

In the camp there was a canteen and a classroom, a chapel and buildings for the accommodation of the priest and the religious teachers. The convicts' barracks and ruins were divided into separate rooms for well-behaving and rebellious convicts, where well-behaving convicts were housed in bedrooms and the others in separate rooms. The single cells testify to the practiced method of punishment of isolation.


Snake oil

In English, snake oil is the name for a product (usually a drug) that has no real effect, or which is given properties it does not have. The term comes from the "snake oil" that people said would cure many kinds of health problems. Many 19th-century United States and 18th-century European entrepreneurs advertised and sold mineral oil as "snake oil liniment". Different herbs and spices, were added to the mineral oil. Sometimes, it also contained other drugs, but it didn't contain any products made from snakes. They also said snake oil could be used as a panacea. Drugs that claimed to be a panacea were extremely common from the 18th century until the 20th, particularly among vendors masking addictive drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, alcohol and opium-based products, to be sold at medicine shows as medication or products promoting health.

Echo (acoustics)

In acoustics, echo is when sound comes back. The word echo come from Greek word ἠχώ ("ēchō) from (ēchos), "sound"." 

In nature echo happens in empty spaces, woods or mountains. 

Panacea (medicine)

In medicine, a panacea is a drug that can cure all diseases. In the Middle Ages, alchemists tried to find such a drug. Because different diseases, have different causes, they need to be treated in different ways. For this reason, such a drug cannot exist.

Hyde Park Barracks

Hyde Park Barracks in Sydney, Australia is a brick building designed by convict and architect Francis Greenway and constructed from 1818 to 1819. The building on "Macquarie Street" in Sydney CBD, and is listed on UNESCO's World Heritage List as Australian Convict Sites and on the Australian National Heritage List. The site was intended to house male convicts. Today it is operated as a museum by the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales.

The building is in close proximity to the historic Sydney Mint and Hyde Park.

Governor Lachlan Macquarie ordered the construction of brickwork to house convicts until 1838 who had to work for the colonial government of New South Wales. With this building, Macquarie deviated from the previously practiced British colonial policy of creating convict camps in which strict discipline and religious education were practiced, thereby liberalising them. From 1848 to 1886 it was used for young immigrants looking for work and waiting for their families. From 1887 to 1979 it housed courts and government offices.

In 1981 the building was restored and today it houses a museum about the history of the convicts. In July 2010 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of a selected set of Australian Convict Sites.

The museum can be visited daily with a few exceptions on certain days and certain public holidays.

Old Government House, Parramatta

The Old Government House and Government Domain is a listed ensemble of the Old Government House, outbuildings and Parramatta Park in Parramatta, now a suburb of Sydney in New South Wales, Australia . The buildings were the residences of twelve of New South Wales' early governors from 1788 to 1865. 

The "Old Government House" is Australia's oldest public building. It was built in 1799 on behalf of Governor John Hunter and was later the permanent residence of Governor Lachlan Macquarie, who built the outbuildings.

Due to its national and international importance, the building is 1.1 km² park on August 1 2007 as an ensemble in the National Monument Protection List and on July 31 2010 it was entered in the list of the UNESCO world cultural heritage. It is an example of a Georgian structure of high structural quality. It was built by convicts and is one of eleven buildings that document the building culture of early New South Wales as an Australian convict colony as Australian Convict Sites.

The Dharug people lived in this area, whose former presence has been proven by archaeological findings (historical rubbish heaps in the park). Some of the shells found in the rubbish heaps were used to make lime mortar for the construction of the building.

The building can be viewed by group registration.


Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park

Franklin Gordon Wild Rivers National Park is a national park in Tasmania.

The park's name comes from the two main rivers within the park, the Franklin River and the Gordon River. The Wild Rivers National Park emerged from the former Frenchmans Cap National Park, which had its borders along the Franklin River. Frenchman's Cap can be seen from afar, best seen from the west side and the north side of the park. The dispute over the Franklin Dam, which was to become part of a large-scale project to supply electricity through hydropower in Tasmania, contributed to the designation of the area in its current size. The project failed due to resistance from the Australian environmental movement in 1983.

The park is about 117 km west of Hobart, between the central highlands and the west coast of Tasmania, in the very heart of the Tasmanian Wilderness which is a UNESCO world heritage site. The only one road that runs through the park, is the Lyell Highway, numbered as A10. This winds 56 kilometres through the park and makes travel inside the park easy.

The national park contains numerous sites that point to the early settlement by the Aboriginals and are still of great spiritual importance for the Aboriginal community today. The original inhabitants of Tasmania, who lived in isolation from the inhabitants of the mainland for a really long time, developed a culture that differed from them; through the use of fire they introduced profound changes in the vegetation communities.

However, Europeans invaded the area from around 1822. It was then that Macquarie Harbour penal colony was established on Sarah Island. Convicts who managed to escape tried to escape into the wilderness, but often, many had died in the process. From 1850, many prospectors came to the area.

The landscape is characterised by impressive mountain peaks, beautiful rainforests, deep river valleys and spectacular gorges.

The national park is home to the golden-bellied parakeet, a critically endangered species of bird. Well-known mammals include the kangaroo species red-necked wallaby and filander, as well as the bag-marten and the well infamous Tasmanian devil. Echidna, platypus, wombats and ring pouches can also be found here as well.


Pithecopus nordestinus

Pithecopus nordestinus is a frog that lives in Brazil.

Vatnajökull National Park

Vatnajökull National Park (Icelandic: "Vatnajökulsþjóðgarður") is one of three national parks in Iceland. It contains the entire Vatnajökull glacier and the former Skaftafell National Park in the southwest and the former Jökulsárgljúfur National Park in the north.

What's special about the Vatnajökull National Park lies mainly in its great variety of scenic features, which are created by rivers, glaciers, volcanism and geothermal activity.

Vatnajökull National Park was opened in June 2008. It had an area of 12,000 km². Since its expansion to include Lakagígar, Langisjór and Krepputunga, the park now contains 14,200 km², or around 14% of Iceland's land area. The only park in Europe bigger than Vatnajökull National Park is the Jugyd Wa National Park in Russia. On the 25th of June 2017 the national park was upsized by another 189 km². The Jökulsárlón and parts of the Fjallsárlón and Breiðamerkursandur have been placed under protection by the Environment Minister Björt Ólafsdóttir.

In 2019 the park was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

The Vatnajökull has a surface area of 8,100 km² Europe's largest glacier. The thickness of the ice is between 400 to 800 m, at the thickest point the ice is 950 m. The glacier ice covers a multitude of mountains, valleys and plateaus. It even covers some active central volcanoes, of which Bárðarbunga is the largest and Grímsvötn the most active. The ice masses extend from over 2000 m above sea level up to 300 m below sea level. Nowhere else in Iceland, except on the Mýrdalsjökull glacier, does so much precipitation fall or so much water flow into the sea as on the south side of Vatnajökull. In fact, so much water is currently stored in Vatnajökull that Ölfusá, Iceland's river with the largest volume of water, would take over 200 years to transport this amount of water into the sea.

The landscape that surrounds the glacier is very varied. In the north, the highland plateau is crossed by glacier rivers, which swell strongly in summer. The volcanoes Askja, Kverkfjöll and Snæfell dominate this area, as well as the volcanic table mountain Herðubreið. Long ago, huge glacial floods cut the Jökulsárgljúfur gorge into the northern part of this plateau. The mighty Dettifoss waterfall still thunders into the top of this gorge.

The south side of Vatnajökull is known for many high mountain ridges, between which glacier tongues flow down into the valleys. The southernmost part of the glacier covers the central volcano Öræfajökull and Iceland's highest mountain peak, Hvannadalshnjúkur. Protected by the high ice masses, the Skaftafell, which is mostly grown over by plants, overlooks the black sands deposited to the west of the Skeiðará river. The sand is mostly ash, which comes from the frequent eruptions of the Grímsvötn.

To the south of the park is Morsárfoss, the highest waterfall in Iceland.

The west of Vatnajökull is also largely dominated by volcanic activity. Two of the world's largest fissures and lava eruptions in historical terms took place there: near Eldgjá (934) and Lakagígar (1783–1784). Vonarskarð, northwest of the glacier, is a colourful, well-tempered area and is a watershed between north and south Iceland.

The weather can vary considerably in an area as large as that of the national park, especially since there is a large difference in altitude.

Precipitation in the lower areas south of the Vatnajokull Ice Cap varies between 1,000 mm and 3,000 mm per year. The temperatures are between 10 °C and 20 °C in summer, while winters are rather mild (the thermometer rarely falls below −10 °C and the temperature is often well above freezing point).

On the mountains and the ice cap itself, annual rainfall is between 4,000 and 5,000 mm, most of it falls as snow. The thickness of the snowpack on Öræfajökull is between 10 and 15 m. Part of the snow melts while the rest of the snow forms the glacier ice. This process takes place everywhere above the snow line on the Vatnajökull ice cap.

Temperatures on the southern part of the ice cap are almost always below zero and can drop to −20 °C in winter or −30 °C fall. Strong winds and storms are normal. The further north you get behind the ice cap, the lower the annual rainfall. To the northeast of the ice cap, it falls to between 350 and 450 mm per year, which is the lowest rainfall in Iceland. The precipitation rises again closer to the north coast and in parts of the highlands around Askja. The temperature can drop sharply on clear and windless days in winter.

South winds generally lead to little or no precipitation in the north, which is associated with higher temperatures. North winds bring clouds with them, resulting in colder and wetter weather in the north of the country, while the south remains sunnier and milder. The same applies to westerly or southwest winds, which bring warmer weather to the east. The opposite is the case when the wind comes from the east: it leads to cold and precipitation in the east and better weather in the west of Iceland. This is the result of the foehn wind : moist, cold air rises near the highlands, condenses and falls as rain over the highlands, while warmer, drier air falls down into the valley on the other side. The temperature difference can be 10 °C or more.

Vatnajökull National Park is divided into four areas, each of which is taken care of on its own. The northern area is the northwestern part of the Vatnajökull, the Askja Caldera and its surroundings, the Jökulsárgljúfur gorge and parts of the Jökulsá-á-Fjöllum river valley. A visitor centre and a camp site are in Ásbyrgi and another camp site is at Vesturdalur.

In addition to the Kverkfjöll Mountains and the northeastern part of Vatnajökull, the eastern area also includes the foothills of Snæfellsöræfi. A visitor centre is in Skriðuklaustur.

The southern area is the southeastern part of Vatnajökull from the Lómagnúpur Mountains in the west to Lón and Lónsöræfi in the east. A visitor centre and a campsite are in Skaftafell. Information centres in Höfn, Hoffell, Hólmur and Skálafell also cooperate with the national park administration.

The western area is the southwestern part of Vatnajökull and large areas outside the glacier, including the Lakagígar craters and Langisjór. An information centre is in Kirkjubæjarklaustur and is run jointly by the national park and the local community.

The visitor centre in Skaftafell is open all year round. The centres in Ásbyrgi and Skriðuklaustur are open from the beginning of May to September, but can also be opened in winter upon request. However most parts of the national park in the highlands cannot be reached in winter.

National park employees carry out controls and offer courses in the highlands. The opening times of the centres vary from area to area, with the first employees driving into the highlands as soon as the main roads are clear. This happens around mid-June and they leave the area around the end of September.

During the summer, employees offer short hikes with explanations on natural history. From mid-June to mid-August they conduct daily interactive hikes in Àsbyrgi and Skaftafell. In the highlands there are daily hikes from the beginning of July to mid-August.

History of Austria

The history of Austria covers the history of Austria and its predecessor states, from the Early Stone Age to the present state. 

The name Ostarrîchi (Austria) has been in use since 996 AD. Then, it was a margravate of the Duchy of Bavaria. Afterwards, from 1156, it became an independent duchy (later archduchy) of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation ("Heiliges Römisches Reich" 962–1806).

The House of Habsburg and House of Habsburg-Lorraine (Haus Österreich) dominated Austria from 1273 to 1918. In 1806, when Emperor Francis I of Austria dissolved the Holy Roman Empire, Austria became the Austrian Empire. It was also part of the German Confederation until the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. In 1867, Austria formed a dual monarchy with Hungary: the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1867–1918). Austria was reduced to the German-speaking areas of the empire (its current frontiers), after its collapse in 1918. It adopted the name The Republic of German-Austria. However, union with Germany and the chosen country name were forbidden by the Allies at the Treaty of Versailles. This led to the creation of the First Austrian Republic (1919-1933).

Following the First Republic, Austrofascism tried to keep Austria independent from the German Reich. Engelbert Dollfuss accepted that most Austrians were German and Austrian, but wanted Austria to remain independent from Germany. In 1938, Adolf Hitler annexed Austria to the German Reich with the Anschluss. A large majority of the Austrian people supported it. Ten years after the Second World War, Austria again became an independent republic as the Second Austrian Republic in 1955.

Austria joined the European Union in 1995.

Edith Rigby

Edith Rigby ( Rayner) (18 October 1872 – 23 July 1950) was an English suffragette. She wanted women in Britain to have the right to vote. She founded a night school in Preston. It was called St Peter's School and its aim was to educate women and girls. Later, she became an important activist. She was sent to prison seven times and committed several acts of arson (illegally setting things on fire).

Rigby was born on 18 October 1872 in Preston, Lancashire. She was one of seven children of Dr Alexander Clement Rayner and she was educated at Penrhos College in North Wales.

She married Dr Charles Rigby and lived with him in Winckley Square in Preston.

In 1907 Rigby formed the Preston branch of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). She was a suffragette recruiter. Rigby took part in a march to the Houses of Parliament in London with Christabel and Sylvia Pankhurst in 1908. Fifty-seven women, including Rigby, were arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. During this time, Rigby took part in hunger strikes and was force-fed. Rigby planted a bomb in the Liverpool Corn Exchange on 5 July 1913. In court, it was stated that ‘no great damage had been done by the explosion’. Mrs Rigby was sent to prison for nine months with hard labour.

Rigby had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU.

She said she set fire to the bungalow of Sir William Lever, Bt 
(later Lord Leverhulme) on 7 July 1913. The property, near Rivington Pike on the West Pennine Moors, had a lot of valuable paintings and the attack resulted in damage costing £20,000.
After she said:

Rigby disagreed with the WSPU's decision not to campaign on suffrage issues during World War I. She joined the Independent Women's Social and Political Union split, forming a branch in Preston.

According to Elizabeth Ashworth in "Champion Lancastrians", in 1888, Rigby was the first woman in Preston to own a bicycle. During World War I, she bought a cottage near Preston named Marigold Cottage and used it to produce food for the war effort.

In 1926, Charles Rigby retired and the couple built a new house. It was called Erdmuth and it was located outside Llanrhos, North Wales. Charles died before it was finished, however, and Edith moved there alone at the end of 1926. She eventually suffered from Parkinson's disease and died in 1950 at Erdmuth.

Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan

The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) is a women's organization in Kabul, Afghanistan. In Persian, it is called جمعیت انقلابی زنان افغانستان ("Jamiʿat-e Enqelābi-ye Zanān-e Afghānestān), in Pashto its name is د افغانستان د ښڅو انقلابی جمعیت ." It works for women's rights. It wants Afghanistan to have a government that is chosen by the Afghan people, a democracy. RAWA also wants that government to not be based on a religious belief or to allow religious leaders to have too much power. In English, this kind of government is called a secular state. The group is against violence.

Meena Keshwar Kamal, an Afghan student activist founded RAWA in 1977. In February 1987, Kamal was killed for her political work. The group was started in Kabul, but it moved to Pakistan in the early 1980s.

The group wants women to be part of both political and social activities. That way, they should get human rights. They should also continue to work against the government of Afghanistan, because it is not democratic or secular enough. In the last years, many Afghan governments were fundamentalist. According to RAWA, women should be part of a democratic and secular Afghan government. Afghanistan has seen many civil wars. RAWA wants to disarm the different groups. The group has opposed all Afghan governments, since 1977: the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, the Islamic State of Afghanistan, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996-2001), the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2001-2021), and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (from 2021).

The RAWA was started in Kabul in 1977 as an independent social and political organization of Afghan women fighting for human rights and social justice. The organization then moved parts of its work out of Afghanistan into Pakistan. For many years, it has been working for Afghan women from Pakistan. A group of Afghan women led by Meena Keshwar Kamal founded RAWA in 1977. At age 21, she worked on educating women. This was the founding idea for RAWA. In 1979, Kamal began a campaign against the Soviet occupation and the Soviet-supported government of Afghanistan. In 1981, she launched a bilingual magazine "Payam-e-Zan" ("Women's Message").That year, she visited France for the French Socialist Party Congress. She also established schools for Afghan refugee children, hospitals and handicraft centers for refugee women in Pakistan. Because of her activities and views, as well as her work against the government and religious fundamentalists, she was assassinated on February 4, 1987.

In the 1990s, RAWA held many seminars and press conferences, and did some fundraising in Pakistan. RAWA also created secret schools and orphanages for women and girls in Pakistan and Afghanistan. They secretly filmed how the religious police beat women, and executed some of them. Both the Taliban and the Northern Alliance outlawed RAWA activities, but RAWA continued. RAWA was even able to show what they did in publications like "Payam-e-Zan".

In 2001 NATO removed the Taliban government from power, and started occupation. RAWA is very critical about this, because there were many civilian casualties. The group even threatened to sue the US government, because it had used four photos of the RAWA website without permission. These photos were used in propaganda material that was later dropped on cities in Afghanistan, during the 2001 invasion.

RAWA warned that the Afghan forces that fought alongside NATO troops were just as fundamentalist and dangerous as the Taliban. The government led by President Hamid Karzai didn't have any support in most parts of Afghanistan. According to RAWA, fundamentalists were enforcing laws against women in much the same way the Taliban had done. Media reports about the Herat government of Ismail Khan also support these claims. Khan was the person who created a Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. Reports by Human Rights Watch also support these claims. One report released by Human Rights Watch in 2012 describes a situation where women are punished by the law for attempting to escape from domestic abuse and also occasionally for being victims of rape. According to the report, Karzai was unwilling or unable to have a unchanging opion against conservative forces. According to the report, it was shocking to see that after ten years, the situation of women in Afghanistan hadn't changed much.

RAWA still does much of the same things it did in the 1980s: Collect money to support hospitals, schools and orphanages. They still run many projects in Afghanistan an Pakistan. Since 2006, RAWA has held an event on International Women's Day.

In 2006, a member of RAWA was invited to a televised discussion on a local Afghan TV channel, TOLO TV. In that discussion, she talked with a representative of a hard line Islamic fundamentalist group. She named the leaders of the different Islamist groups. During the discussion, she called these leaders war criminals and said they were responsible for "the ongoing tragedy in Afghanistan". TOLO TV edited the discussion, and removed the audio of the parts that contained the names of the people she gave.

On October 7, 2006, the Afghan Women's Mission (AWM) organized a fund raising event for RAWA in Los Angeles, California. Eve Ensler was the chief guest and radio host. Sonali Kolhatkar and Zoya, a member of RAWA, were among the speakers. "Zoya" is a pseudonym for an active member of RAWA's Foreign Committee who has traveled to many countries, including the United States, Spain and Germany. In 2003, she published her biography "Zoya’s Story - An Afghan Woman's Battle for Freedom". In June 2008, Zoya testified to the Human Rights Commission of the German Parliament (Bundestag) to persuade the German government to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.

In 2009, RAWA and other women's rights groups strongly condemned a "Shia Family Code". They say it legalized rape in a marriage within Northern Afghan Shia Muslim communities. It also supports child marriage, and purdah (seclusion) for married women. President Hamid Karzai passed this law to get more support for his coalition government from hardliners in these communities. With this law he also got support from Iran. This code also discriminates against women when they want to inherit, or get a divorce.

In February 2012, the group commemorated the 25th anniversary of the death of RAWA founder Meena Keshwar Kamal with a gathering of women in Kabul. In August 2012, a RAWA representative was a keynote speaker at the annual convention of Veterans For Peace at the University of Maryland in College Park.

RAWA has so far won 16 awards and certificates from around the world for its work for human rights and democracy. They include the sixth Asian Human Rights Award - 2001, the French Republic's Liberty, Equality, Fraternity Human Rights Prize, 2000, Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize 2001, Glamour Women of the Year 2001, 2001 SAIS-Novartis International Journalism Award from Johns Hopkins University, Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition from the U.S. Congress, 2004, Honorary Doctorate from University of Antwerp (Belgium) for outstanding non-academic achievements, and other awards.

In the book "With All Our Strength: The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan"
by Anne Brodsky, a number of world-known writers and human rights activists share their views of RAWA. They include Arundhati Roy who says "Each of us needs a little RAWA"; Eve Ensler, author of "The Vagina Monologues", who suggests that RAWA must stand as a model for every group working to end violence; Katha Pollitt, author of "Subject to Debate: Sense and Dissents on Women, Politics, and Culture"; Ahmed Rashid, author of "Taliban" and "Jihad"; and Asma Jahangir, Special Rapporteur of the United Nations and prominent women's rights activist of Pakistan are two Pakistanis who write about RAWA and express their support.


History of Catalonia

Catalonia was first settled during the Middle Palaeolithic era. The area was occupied by the Iberians and Greeks established several colonies on the coast before the Roman conquest. It was the first area of Hispania conquered by the Romans. It then came under Visigothic rule after the collapse of the western part of the Roman Empire. In 718, the Umayyad Caliphate occupied the area and became a part of Muslim ruled al-Andalus. The Frankish Empire conquered the area from the Muslims. It created a buffer zone of Christian counties against Islamic rule known as the Marca Hispanica. In the 10th century the County of Barcelona became progressively independent from Frankish rule.

In 1137, Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona accepted King Ramiro II of Aragon's proposal to marry Queen Petronila. Thus they united the dinasties of the County of Barcelona with the Kingdom of Aragon and they created the Crown of Aragon. Meanwhile, the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan counties adopted a common polity known as Principality of Catalonia. Catalonia contributed to the expansion of the Crown's trade and military, most significantly their navy. The crisis of the 14th century, the end of the reign of House of Barcelona and a civil war (1462–1472) weakened the role of the Principality in Crown and international affairs.
The marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1469 created a dynastic union between the Crowns of Aragon and Castile. However, both kingdoms kept their own laws, institutions, borders and currency. In 1492 the Spanish colonization of the Americas began, political power began to shift away towards Castile. The economic crisis, the peasants' revolt and tensions between Catalan institutions and the Monarchy caused the Reapers' War (1640–1652). The Principality of Catalonia maintained its political status, but it lost it after the War of Spanish Succession (1701–1714). Following Catalan surrender on 11 September 1714, the king Philip V of Bourbon, inspired by the model of France, imposed a unifying administration across Spain. He suppressed the Crown of Aragon and enacted the Nueva Planta decrees, banning the main Catalan political institutions and rights. These led to the eclipse of Catalan as a language of government and literature. Catalonia experienced economic growth. This was reinforced in the late 18th century when Cádiz's trade monopoly with American colonies ended.
In the 19th century Catalonia was very affected by the Napoleonic and Carlist Wars. The Napoleonic occupation and subsequent war in Spain began a period of political and economic turmoil. In the second third of the century, Catalonia became a center of industrialization. Thanks to its wealth from the industrial expansion, Catalonia experienced a cultural renaissance. This happened at the same time as nationalism and several workers movements (particularly anarchism) appeared.

In the 20th century, Catalonia enjoyed and lost varying degrees of autonomy. The Second Spanish Republic established Catalan self-governance and the official use of the Catalan language. The Republican defeat established the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. During this time, the autonomy was suppressed. Between 1959 and 1974 Spain experienced an economic expansion known as the Spanish Miracle. Catalonia prospered as Spain's most important industrial and tourist area. In 1975 Franco died, bringing his regime to an end. The new democratic Spanish constitution of 1978 recognised Catalonia's autonomy and language. It regained considerable self-government. In the 2010s there have been growing calls for Catalan independence.

Women for Afghan Women

Women for Afghan Women (often shortened to WAW) is an organization that was founded in 2001. It wants to help women in Afghanistan. It is independent of the government. It is the largest non-government Afghan women's rights organization in the world. It is dedicated to protecting the rights of Afghan women and girls. The staff are mostly Afghans. WAW adopts a community-based approach. For example, they give workshops about women's rights according to Islamic law. WAW opened what it called family guidance centers: there, women can ask for help, if they have problems at home. They also get counseling, for example, if the women are the victims of domestic violence. If there is a danger to the health or the life of the woman, the woman is sent to a women's shelter. In the shelters, women can talk to layers who help them fight for their rights. They can also get teaching in different skills. When these services are not enough, WAW also helps the women get a divorce. As well as the women, their children can also get a basic education in these centers. 

Women in Afghanistan have built houses for women as shelters in most of the provinces in Afghanistan such as in Kabul, Kapisa, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kunduz, Faryab, and Saripul. The vision of the organization is to help the women get independent, WAW wants the women to participate in different areas of society: in politics, cultural reforms and social development. 

According to WAW, there are many rules and norms which stand in the way of the women getting more freedoms. To achieve their goals, the organisation also relies on religion, and the social context these women are in. It wants to establish a shelter for women in every province in the country. Accorording to WAW, the Taliban have become more violent, because there were freign troops in Afghanistan. WAW also teaches its members how to read and write. Children enter the organization's kindergarten to learn reading, writing, doing art, sing songs, and playing games. Women for Afghan Women uses the Bill of Afghan women in order to implement women's right and meet the needs of woman in Afghanistan. The Bill of Rights was signed by the president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai and it was handed to all women who participated the third yearly conference of the organization.

When it comes to freedom, Afghan girls and women are in a bad position: In 2012, Afghanistan was nominated the most dangerous country that a girl can be born in. Many women are poor, and getting health care is difficullt for them. This is mainly caused by decades of civil war. Because there was no economy that worked well, this made it difficult for women to live there. When a woman with children is sentenced to go to prison, she usually takes her children to prison as well. WAW's Children's Support Center (CSC) raises money to get children out of prison. WAW has a program that helps uneducated children meet the criteria to enter a local school. Afghan women are usually afraid to speak about the mistreatment that they face every day in their lives. WAW's biggest projects is to give these women a voice, and to build the self-esteem of Afghan women who are used to burying their emotions and their opinions. Ten percent of the Afghan women receive this aid, and can express their opinions in front of millions of people.

WAW also operate halfway houses, for women who have just left prison, and have nowhere else to go. In these halfway houses, WAW also helps these women find a new job, and a place to live. 

Callimedusa atelopoides

The toady leaf frog or terrestrial monkey frog ("Calllimedusa atelopoides") is a frog that lives in Bolivia and Peru, but scientists think it may one day live in Colombia and Ecuador too. People have seen it as high as 200 meters above sea level.

Unlike most tree frogs, this frog does not live in the water at all when it is an adult. It is brown in color and lives in trees.

The adult male frog is cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is long. It is green with orange color on its sides and legs. The irises of its eyes are silver or gray.

The male frog sounds like "wort" when he sings for the female frog. When it is time to lay eggs, the female frog lays 20 eggs at a time on a leaf and then folds the leaf around the eggs. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall out of the nest into the water.

Scientists believe that this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place.

Katie Mitchell is a quirky aspiring filmmaker in Kentwood, Michigan, who often clashes with her nature-obsessed and technophobic father Rick, and has recently been accepted into film school in California. The evening before Katie leaves, Rick accidentally breaks her laptop after a fight over one of Katie's previous short films, leading the family to fear their relationship will forever be strained. To try to prevent this, Rick decides to cancel Katie's flight and instead take her, her mother Linda, younger brother Aaron, and family dog Monchi on a cross-country road trip to her college as one last bonding experience.

Meanwhile, technology entrepreneur Mark Bowman declares his highly intelligent AI PAL obsolete as he unveils a new line of home robots to replace her. In revenge, PAL orders all the robots to capture humans worldwide and launch them into space. The Mitchells manage to avoid capture at a roadstop café in Kansas. Rick decides that his family should stay put in the café for their own safety, but Katie convinces him to help save the world instead. They meet two defective robots, Eric and Deborahbot 5000, who tell the family they can use a kill code to shut down PAL and all the robots.

The Mitchells make it to a mall in eastern Colorado to upload the kill code, but PAL chip-enabled appliances attempt to stop them. Katie tries to upload the kill code, but is stopped when a giant Furby pursues the family. They ultimately trap and defeat the Furby, destroying a PAL router in the process, which disables the hostile devices but stops the kill code from uploading. On the way to Silicon Valley to upload the kill code directly to PAL, Linda reveals to Katie that she and Rick had originally lived in a cabin in the mountains years ago as it was his lifelong dream before he gave up on it.

Upon arriving in Silicon Valley, the Mitchells disguise themselves as robots and head to PAL Labs HQ to shut it down, but PAL manipulates them by revealing surveillance footage from the café of Katie telling Aaron in secret that she was pretending to have faith in Rick so that he would take them to upload the kill code. As a heartbroken Rick sees this, the Mitchells fail to reach PAL's lair and Rick and Linda are captured by PAL's stronger and smarter robots. PAL then reprograms Eric and Deborahbot to obey her, while Katie, Aaron, and Monchi escape.

Katie discovers Rick's recordings of her childhood on her camera, realizing that Rick gave up on his lifelong dream to give his daughter a normal life. In the meantime, Rick reflects on his actions after seeing one of Katie's videos that mirrors his relationship with Katie. Reinvigorated, Katie and Aaron infiltrate PAL Labs HQ again, this time using Monchi to malfunction the robots, as his appearance causes an error in their programming. With help from Mark, Rick and Linda free themselves and plan to upload Katie's home movie of Monchi to short-circuit the robots. However, Rick is outnumbered by the robots when he is about to upload the video, while Katie and Aaron are captured.

Facing PAL to justify saving humanity, Katie explains that no matter how hard her family struggles, they will always stay connected despite how different they are. PAL rejects this reasoning and drops Katie from her lair. Eric and Deborahbot, having been inspired by Rick's "reprogramming" himself that allowed him to use a computer, revert to their malfunctioning states and upload Katie's home movie, saving her and helping the rest of the Mitchells. The family bands together to fight the rest of the robots. Katie eventually destroys PAL by dropping her into a glass of water, freeing all the humans and disabling the remaining robots.

A few months after the uprising, Katie and her family arrive at her college as she shares one last goodbye with them. She later joins them on another road trip with Eric and Deborahbot to Washington, D.C. to accept the Congressional Gold Medal.

Behaviour-changing parasite

Behaviour-changing parasites are parasites with two or more hosts. They "cause changes in the behaviour of one of their hosts". This has the effect of improving their chances of reproduction. 

They make the first host more likely to be eaten by a predator. Then the parasite reproduces sexually in the predator. Examples can be found in bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and animals. 

Parasites may also change the host behaviour to increase the protection to the parasites or their offspring. The term "bodyguard manipulation" may be used for such mechanisms.

Example: a parasitic worm is eaten by an amphipod. The worm changes the behaviour of the host amphipod. The changes make it more likely that the amphipod is eaten by fish, where it reproduces. The induced behavioral change in the host thus leads to the parasite's increased success in completing its life cycle.

.kkrieger

.kkrieger (from "Krieger", German for warrior) is a first-person shooter video game made by German demogroup .theprodukkt (previously part of Farbrausch). The game won first place in the 96k game competition at Breakpoint in April 2004 and is in beta.

The game has been made since mid-2002 using .werkkzeug3, an unreleased version of .werkkzeug (from "Werkzeug", German for tool). The source code of ".werkkzeug3" was released in 2014. It can use the BSD license or be public domain.

Textures are quite small, using creation history, not single pixels. Basic shapes such as boxes and cylinders are modeled into other shapes. How both are loaded at the same time takes a long time.

Most popular first-person shooters filled one or more CDs or DVDs at the time, but the game uses 97,280 bytes, over 7,000 times less than a CD (700MB), or 55,000 times less than an "Unreal Tournament 2004" installation (5.5GB). That game normally comes on a DVD. ".kkrieger"'s developers say storing it normally would use about 200–300 MB.

The V2 synthesizer streams the game music and sounds using MIDI.

Callimedusa baltea

The purple-sided leaf frog ("Calllimedusa baltea") is a frog that lives in Peru. Scientists have seen it between 1280 and 1500 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in cloud forests. The female frog lays eggs in pools that dry up for part of the year.

This frog is in danger of dying out because human beings cut down the forests to get wood, to dig good rocks out of the ground, to raise cows, to grow coca plants, and to grow food to eat. Scientists think some of this even happens in one of the protected parts where the frog lives, Reserva Comunal El Sira. In other places, the ground is too steep for human beings to cut the trees.

Genshin Impact

Genshin Impact () is an action role-playing game developed by Chinese developer miHoYo. The game is an anime style open-world game and has an action-based battle system. The game is free-to-play with a gacha system. While developed after "Honkai Impact 3rd" (2016) with a similar title naming, "Genshin Impact" is not a sequel of "Honkai Impact 3rd".

"Genshin Impact" allows the player to control one of four characters in a party. Switching between characters can be done quickly in combat. That allows the player to use several different combinations of skills and attacks.

Each character has two unique combat skills: an elemental skill and an elemental burst. The elemental skill can be used at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after use. The elemental burst has an energy cost, requiring the user to save enough elemental energy by defeating enemies or make elemental status effects. Characters' attacks are one of seven elements: Cryo, Dendro, Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, Electro and Geo, which correspond to ice, grass, fire, water, wind, electricity, and rock, respectively.

"Genshin Impact" takes place in the world of Teyvat. Teyvat has seven distinct nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin siblings before becoming separated in Teyvat. At the beginning of the game, players need to choose one of the twin siblings as a player character and give them a name. The official names for them are Aether (male) and Lumine (female). Unfortunately, at this time, there is no option to change the twin sibling later on during the game. These travelers can change their element whenever they want. They have to visit a Statue Of Seven in the nation of the desired element, and they will see this option.

"Genshin Impact" began development as early as late January 2017. The initial team had 120 people and grew to 400 by the end of that year, and reached 700 by February 2021. miHoYo revealed the game in June 2019 at E3 2019. The game was developed using the Unity (game engine). The game has voice-overs in four languages (English, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean), and 13 different languages for text. The game was designed as a cross-platform title. Developing the game for PC and PlayStation platforms allowed the developers to raise graphical quality for the game, like rendering realistic shadows.

Yu-Peng Chen of HOYO-MiX composed the game's original score, which was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra.

"Genshin Impact" was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Android, and iOS in September 2020, PlayStation 5 in April 2021, and is planned for future release on the Nintendo Switch.

"Genshin Impact" received "generally favorable reviews" according to review aggregator Metacritic.

Jesus in Islam

Isa Masih was a 1st century preacher. In Islam, he is the penultimate prophet and messenger of God, sent to guide the Children of Israel with a revelation: "Injīl". He is believed to be a descendant of Ibrahim, and is seen as an example for all Muslims to follow. According to the Quran, Jibrael told that the name of the figure will be Masih Isa.

According to the Quran, Isa foretold the coming of Muhammad in As-Saff 61:6. In Islam, Isa is the only prophet to return. Muslims believe that Isa will return in a Second Coming to fight Gog and Magog and "Al-Masih ad-Dajjal" or "False Messiah" and establish peace and justice on earth.

The birth narrative in the Quran for Isa begins at Quran 19:16–34 and Q3:45–53. Islamic theology affirms Maryam as a pure vessel. Islamic exegesis affirms the virginal birth of Isa. The narrative of the virgin birth is an announcement to Mary by the angel Gabriel while Mary is being raised in the Temple after having been pledged to God by her mother. Gabriel states she is honored over all women of all nations and has brought her glad tidings of a holy son. A hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah, quotes Muhammad explaining that both Jesus and Mary were protected from Satan's touch at birth, quoting from Q3:36. The Quran states that son of Maryam and his mother a sign; and we made them abide in an elevated place, full of quiet and watered with springs."
 Muslims believe that Isa became a prophet when he was born and spoke in infancy. From the Islamic basis, reflected upon all previous prophets through the lens of Muslim identity, Isa is considered no more than a messenger repeating a repetitive message of the ages. Some Islamic traditions believe Isa's mission was only to the people of Israil and his status as a prophet being confirmed by numerous miracles.

Muslims believe that God revealed to Isa a new scripture, "Injīl" (the Gospel), while also declaring the truth of the previous revelations: "Tawrat" (the Torah) and "Zabur" (the Psalms). The Quran speaks favorably of "al-Injīl." Traditional Islamic exegesus claiming the biblical message to have been distorted or corrupted. This polemic effort has its origins in the medieval period with Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad's writings.

The Quran states that Isa was aided by a group of disciples who believed in His message. The Quran mentions in chapter 3, verses 52–53, that the disciples submitted to the faith of Islam:

The longest narrative involving Isa's disciples is when Isa performs the miracle of bringing a table of food from heaven at their request, for further proof that his preaching is the true message.

Muslims believe that Isa was not crucified and was raised up into the skies instead of being crucified. Muslims believe that a lookalike was crucified. According to some Shia writings, Isa ascended to heaven wearing a woolen shirt, spun and sewed by Maryam, his mother. As he reached the heavenly regions, he was addressed, 'O Isa, cast away from you the adornment of the world.

 Isa Masih will descent at a white minaret, on the eastern side of Damascus (believed to be the Minaret of Isa in the Umayyad Mosque), Isa would slay the Dajjal, and then everyone who is one of the People of the Book ("ahl al-kitāb", referring to Jews, Sabians and Christians) will believe in him. Thus, there will be one community, that of Islam.

After the death of "al-Mahdi", Isa will assume leadership. This is a time associated in Islamic narrative with universal peace and justice. Islamic texts also allude to the appearance of "Ya'juj and Ma'juj" (known also as Gog and Magog), ancient tribes which will disperse and cause disturbance on earth. God, in response to Jesus' prayers, will kill them by sending a type of worm in the napes of their necks, and send large birds to carry and clear their corpses from the land. According to a hadith, Jesus will marry, have children and rule for forty years after which he will die. Isa would be buried in the city of Madinah in a grave left vacant beside Muhammad, Abu Bakr, and Umar.

Working Women's Forum

The Working Women's Forum (WWF) is a women's organisation in southern India. Jaya Arunachalam founted it in Madras (Chennai) in 1987. It helps poor women in southern India. It makes small loans, a trade union, health care, education and training. It works with the poor women whose jobs are informal, for example street vendors, silkworm growers and silk weavers, handicraft producers, washerwomen and fisherwomen.

WWF has helped more than 7,000,000 women by giving them loans and other things.

Women join the WWF because they can get loans and because the interest rates are not too high.

There are two important organisations related to the WWF :–

These are the four ideas that WWF uses:

"Pro Women:" To work only for women of the informal work sector who feed their families.

"Anti-Dowry:" The WWF wants to stop the customs around wedding dowries. It wants to do this through collective efforts against dowries.

"Anti-Caste and Pro-Secularism": The WWF says it will help women no matter which social rank they have in India's caste system or which religion they have. The WWF says people from different castes should be allowed to marry each other.

"Anti-Politics:" To avoid involving the areas related to political parties and agendas.

WWF was started with 30 women who formed themselves into a group with the help of Jaya Arunchalam. She was then a social/political worker in Madras. The group of women approached a bank for a loan and received a sum of ₹300 for each member. Each day they collected amount from themselves for repayment. The repayment reached 95% of the sum.

By April 1978, about 800 women were involved into this activity. They formed into 40 groups and began receiving loans. This led to the emergence of Working Women's Forum.

Since then the WWF has received massive recognition. Former US state secretary Hillary Clinton made a visit to the WWF in July 2011.

WWF has few socioeconomic and political objectives such as:


'Reaching out to poor women through Grassroots initiatives: An Indian Experiment' - 1992.

'Dynamic Agents of population control and change process: An Indian Experiment' - 1992

'Indian Co-operative Network for Women - An Innovative Approach to Micro - Credit' - 1995

'National Union of Working Women - Breaking the Legacy of Invisibility' - 1995

'Social platform through social innovations - A coalition with women in the informal sector - WWF(I)' - 2000.

She was involved in two major British women's suffrage societies. They were the militant Women's Social and Political Union and the United Suffragists. She helped start the United Suffragists. She became editor of the "Votes for Women" newspaper during the First World War. She was sent to prison twice. She was a book writer who was famous for her children's books.

Evelyn Sharp was born on 4 August 1869. She was the ninth of eleven children. Sharp's family sent her to a boarding school for just two years. However, she passed several university local examinations. Sharp moved to London although her family did not want her to. In London, she wrote several novels including "All the Way to Fairyland" (1898) and "The Other Side of the Sun" (1900).

In 1903, Sharp started writing articles for the "Daily Chronicle", the "Pall Mall Gazette" and the "Manchester Guardian" with the help of Henry Nevinson. Sharp talks about how important Nevison and the Men's League for Women's Suffrage is: "It is impossible to rate too highly the sacrifices that they (Henry Nevinson and Laurence Housman) and H. N. Brailsford, F. W. Pethick Lawrence, Harold Laski, Israel Zangwill, Gerald Gould, George Lansbury, and many others made to keep our movement free from the suggestion of a sex war."

Sharp's journalism made her more aware of working-class women's problems. She joined the Women's Industrial Council and the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. In the autumn of 1906 Sharp was sent by the "Manchester Guardian" to cover the first speech by Elizabeth Robins. After that speech, she joined the Women's Social and Political Union.

Volcanic bomb

A volcanic bomb or lava bomb is a mass of molten rock larger than 64 mm (2.5 inches) in diameter. It forms when a volcano throws viscous pieces of lava during a volcanic eruption. They cool into solid objects before they reach the ground. They are still very hot when they reach the ground, because they are still partly molten inside. Because volcanic bombs cool after they leave the volcano, they are extrusive igneous rocks. Volcanic bombs can be thrown many kilometers from an erupting fissure vent. They often get aerodynamic shapes during their flight. Lava bombs can be extremely large; the 1935 eruption of Mount Asama in Japan expelled bombs measuring 5–6 m (16-20 ft) in diameter up to from the vent. Volcanic bombs are a significant volcanic hazard, and can cause severe injuries and death to people in an eruption zone. At Galeras volcano in Colombia in 1993 six people near the summit were killed and several seriously injured by lava bombs when the volcano erupted unexpectedly. On July 16, 2018, 23 people were injured on a tour boat near the Kilauea volcano as a result of a basketball-sized lava bomb from the 2018 lower Puna eruption.

Volcanic bombs are known to occasionally explode from internal gas pressure as they cool, but usually most of the damage they cause is when they hit. As they are still hot when they land, they often cause a fire to start. Bomb explosions are most often observed in "bread-crust" type bombs.

Omayr

Omayr () also known by the kunya Abu Nasrani () and Abu Wahab () was a Christian soldier, who fought in the Battle of Karbala. Omayr either belonged to the tribe of Banu al-Alim or the tribe of Banu Kalb. He is known as the 'Christian Martyr of Karbala'.

Before being a soldier, Omayr was a well known businessman of Kufa. Omayr is well-known for his courage and soldierly experience. Omayr was a tall and masculine man with broad shoulders, who was held with very high esteem among his people.

Some sources suggest that Omayr's full name was Abdullah ibn Omayr ibn Wahab ibn Abu Wahab al-Kalbi (). Al-Tabari suggests that Omayr was from the Banu al-Alim tribe.

According to Abu Makhnaf, when Kufis were preparing to fight Husayn, Omayr confronted them and asked them about their intentions. Kufis told that they would fight Husayn and Omayr then went to his wife Wahab bint Abd and informed her of his intention. It is reported that Umm Wahab said: "God has guided you to a good path, do so and take me with you". So he went out with his wife at night and joined Husayn.

Omayr was inspired by Husayn’s spiritual charisma and was reluctant to leave him despite of being aware about the consequences of staying with Husayn. In the Battle of Karbala, when Omayr asked for the permission for fighting, Husayn granted him permission believing him to be match for both the challengers.

Omayr stepped into the battlefield and the challengers asked his identity to which he introduced himself. However they could not recognize him and asked either Zuhayr ibn Qayn, Habib ibn Muzahir or Burayr to fight them. Yasir was standing nearby to whom Omayr said "You son of the adulteress! Do you not wish to fight me?!" saying this he attacked Yasir and engaged him in a sword duel but at the same time Salim charged at him with his sword. Omayr while protecting himself lost fingers of his left hand and in retaliatory attack he killed Salim and Yasir. After killing both of them he moved back to Husayn while reciting Martial poetry. Omayr's wife Umm Wahab witnessed Omayr's assassination.

Omayr participated in the retaliatory attack when Al-Shimr attacked Al Husayn's right wing. Omayr in that engagement killed 31 of them, of which 19 were horsemen and 12 were footmen. His right hand was severed by Hani ibn Thabit and left hand by Bakr ibn Hayy having left without arms, he was taken captive and according to some sources, was a put on a cross. Then, Omayr's head was cut off and thrown towards Husayn's camp. According to Al-Tabari, Omayr became the second martyr in the Battle of Karbala. After Omayr's head was thrown, his mother picked it up, took it and wiped her son's blood from it and then ran in the direction of the enemy forces. Husayn sent her back saying that she was exempted from participating in Jihad. Omayr's wife Wahab bint Abd went to his corpse and wiped out the dust and the dirt from his head as well as his face. At this time, Shimr ibn Dhil's servant Rustam striked the woman's head with a spear, causing Umm Wahab to be killed. After Wahab bint Abd was also killed, Omayr's mother is reported to have said "You wicked people! I bear witness that the Christians in their churches are better people than you".

Omayr is highly honored by both Muslims and Christians for his sacrifice in the Battle of Karbala. He is believed to be buried in the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala. Every year, Muslims, as well as Christians, visit the site for commemoration on Ashura.

Jami' al-tawarikh

The Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh (Persian/Arabic: , ) is a work of literature and history, produced in the Mongol Ilkhanate. Written by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani (1247–1318 AD) at the start of the 14th century, large coverage of the work has caused it to be called "the first world history". It was in three volumes and published in Arabic and Persian versions.
The surviving portions total approximately 400 pages of the original work. The work describes cultures and major events in world history from China to Europe; in addition, it covers Mongol history, as a way of establishing their cultural legacy.
The early illustrated manuscripts represent "one of the most important surviving examples of persian art in any medium", and are the largest surviving body of early examples of the Persian miniature.
The "Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh" consists of four main sections of different lengths:


Rashid-al-Din Hamadani was born in 1247 at Hamadan, Iran into a Jewish family.

To write the "Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh", Rashid al-din based his work on many written and oral sources, some of which can be identified:

The "Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh" was the center of an industry for a time, no doubt in part due to the political importance of its author. The workshop was ordered to produce one manuscript each in Arabic and Persian every year, which were to be distributed to different cities. Although approximately 20 of the first generation of manuscripts were produced, very few survive, which are described below. Other later copies were made from the first set, with some illustrations and history added to match current events.

The Edinburgh part has a page size of 41.5 × 34.2 cm, with a written area of 37 × 25 cm, and contains 35 lines per page written in Naskhi calligraphy. There are some omissions: folios 1, 2, 70 to 170, and the end; and it is dated to 1306-1307, in a later inscription, which is nonetheless accepted. The text comprises four parts: the history of Persia and pre-Islamic Arabia, the story of the Prophet and Caliphs, the history of the Ghaznavids, Seljuks and Atabeys, and the history of the sultans of Khwarezm. This part of the manuscript was discovered in the 1800s by Duncan Forbes, who found it among the papers of Colonel John Baillie, so this section is sometimes referred to as "Baillie's collection".

Seventy rectangular miniatures adorn the manuscript, which reflect the cosmopolitan nature of Tabriz at the time of its production. In this capital, a crossroads of trade routes and influences, and a place of great religious tolerance, Christian, Chinese, Buddhist and other models of painting all arrived to feed the inspiration of the artists.

A new painter appears for the portraits of Chinese leaders, which uses special techniques that seem to mimic those of Yuan mural painters (according to S. Blair): an attention to line and wash, and the use of black and bright red. This artist seems to be very familiar with China. The folios are dated 1314, and it was transcribed and illustrated in Tabriz under the supervision of Rashid al-Din.

There are two early 14th century copies in Persian in the Topkapi Palace Library, Istanbul.

Islamic feminism

Feminism is the idea that different sexes and genders are equal in society, that no sex or gender is better or worse than another. Feminism wants women and men to have equal status and equal rights in society. Islamic feminism tries to bring these ideas to countries in which most people are Muslim.

People who are in favor of the idea also say that there are several countries with Muslim majorities, where women had important roles: there were female heads of state, prime ministers, and state secretaries. Examples of such women are Lala Shovkat of Azerbaijan, Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, Mame Madior Boye of Senegal, Tansu Çiller of Turkey, Kaqusha Jashari of Kosovo, and Megawati Sukarnoputri of Indonesia. In Bangladesh, Khaleda Zia was elected the country's first female prime minister in 1991. She served as prime minister until 2009. Sheikh Hasina replaced her. Hasina is still prime minister in 2021. This makes Bangladesh the country with the longest continuous female premiership.

Unlike other feminists, who are usually secular, Islamic feminists want to use Islam and its teachings for their ideas.

One of the things Islamic feminists want to reach is that men and women are truly equal in all aspects of daily life, and in society. They also want to include non-Muslims in their view and debate. Islamic scholars see Islamic feminism as more radical as secular feminism, because it uses Islam with the Quran as its most important text. As a "school of thought" it refers to people such as Morocccan sociologist Fatema Mernissi and scholars such as Amina Wadud and Leila Ahmed.

Islamic feminists read the religious texts with a feminist perspective. They can ground their arguments in Islam and its teachings. They want gender justice and the full equality of women and men in the personal and public sphere. They also want to include non-Muslims in this discussion.

Islamic scholars see Islamic feminism as more radical than secular feminism. They also think that Islamic feminism is part of the teachings of Islam with the Quran as its central text.

Recently, more people have been talking about the concept of Islamic feminism. Different groups in societies which are influenced by Islam wanted to get more support for some of their ideas and policies. In addition, educated Muslim women want their role in society to be more important.

Umm Yasmin, of the Centre for Muslim Minorities and Islam, says that feminism is often mistaken as a western movement. According to Yasmin, Muslim feminists have been active since the early nineteenth century. They do not want to change the religion of Islam, but rather "promote gender equality within a secular society". Yasmin also says that Muslim feminists have adapted their view: Islam can be seen in context, in order to speak about men and women being equal; for Islam doesn't condone violence against women. Since the nineteenth century, both men and women have questioned the legal system regarding the Sharia Laws: These laws say that women should wear a veil. They limit their education, and have an effect on women's seclusion, polygyny and concubinage. In this context, seclusion means that women need to stay at home, and that they need to ask for permission to see or talk to other people outside the family. Many Muslim women wanted to change these laws. They have started schools for girls, and have been opposed to veiling and one man being married to several women. In support of Yasmin's argument, Fatema Mernissi says that the fact that the ideal Muslim woman is shown as "silent and obedient" has nothing to do with the message of Islam. In her view, conservative Muslim men manipulated the religious texts of the Qu'ran to keep their patriarchal system. They did this to prevent women from breaking free, also sexually; with it, they justified a strict veiling and a limitation of women's rights.

 says that Islamic feminism gets its understanding and mandate from the Qu'ran. According to her, it "seeks rights and justice for women, and for men, in [all] their existence." In her writings, she explains that radical Islamists have corrupted Islam with the image of patriarchy and oppression to women. This image is what the rest of the world sees and understands Islam to be. Asma Barlas shares Badran's views. In her works, she discusses the difference between secular and Islamic feminism. According to her, "in countries where Muslims make up 98% of the population, it is not possible to avoid questioning 'its basic beliefs.'"

Fatima Seedat agrees with both Barlas and Badran about the importance of feminism in the Islamic world. According to her, the term “Islamic feminism” is unnecessary since feminism is a “social practice, not merely of personal identity.” Seedat thinks that bringing Islam and feminism together creates more conflict. It allows Islamists to interpret the Qur'an to suit their political needs.

She believes it is important to show how feminism has existed in the Qur'an. In her view, keeping Islam and feminism separate is better for everyone. In the same article, “"Feminism, and Islamic Feminism: Between Inadequacy and Inevitability"”, Seedat explains that the fact that such a term exists, separates Muslims and isolates them from the rest of the world and the feminist movement. In her essay, she states that it is important to share what Islam has to offer feminism with the rest of the world. For this reason, Muslims who are feminists should not refer to themselves as Islamic feminists.

Moroccan writer and sociologist, Fatema Mernissi wrote the essay "Beyond the Veil". In it, she explores the oppressive status of women in Islam, sexual ideology and gender identity through the perspective of Moroccan society and culture. "Beyond the Veil" argues against the discourse on women's sexuality by breaking their silence with providing a voice against the dominance of male patriarchy.

The following qoutes show the parts of Qu'ran to put feminism in context:
"“O mankind! Fear your Lord Who (initiated) your creation from a single soul, then from it created its mate, and from these two spread (the creation of) countless men and women.”"
(Qur’an, 4:1)Allah created both men and women as peers. They were formed from the same soul and the same spiritual nature with neither superior to the other, as shown in the above verse"وَٱللَّهُ جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَٰجًا وَجَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنْ أَزْوَٰجِكُم بَنِينَ وَحَفَدَةً وَرَزَقَكُم مِّنَ ٱلطَّيِّبَٰتِ أَفَبِٱلْبَٰطِلِ يُؤْمِنُونَ وَبِنِعْمَتِ ٱللَّهِ هُمْ يَكْفُرُونَ "

النحل ١٦:٧٢

"And Allah has made for you spouses of your own kind, and given you through your spouses children and grandchildren. And He has granted you good, lawful provisions. Are they then faithful to falsehood and ungrateful for Allah’s favours? (72)" An-Nahl 16:72<nowiki>"وَٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَٱلْمُؤْمِنَـٰتُ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ ۚ يَأْمُرُونَ بِٱلْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ ٱلْمُنكَرِ وَيُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَيُؤْتُونَ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَيُطِيعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُۥٓ ۚ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ سَيَرْحَمُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ"</nowiki>

The believers, both men and women, support each other; they order what is right and forbid what is wrong; they keep up the prayer and pay the prescribed alms; they obey God and His Messenger.

3:195

Then their Lord responded to them, "I do not waste the deed of any doer among you, any male or female. The one of you is as the other (Literally: some of you from some others). So, the ones who emigrated, and were driven out of their residences, and were hurt in My way, and fought, and were killed, indeed I will definitely expiate them of their odious deeds, and indeed I will definitely cause them to enter Gardens from beneath which Rivers run." A requital from (the Providence of) Allah; and Allah has in His Providence the fairest requital. — Dr. Ghali

Khawla bint al-Azwar, was a legendary female Muslim warrior/soldier during the life of the prophet Mohammad. Her brother, Dhiraar al-Azwar, trained her to fight and she fought with him in many battles. Because soldiers wore loose clothing, and wrapped themselves in cloth to protect themselves from the sand and dust, the fact that she was a woman was not known. After she had shown her talent and skill in fighting, she told the men who were close by. 

According to Ahmed Elewa and Laury Silvers, many people have used Islamic tradition of the past 150 years to try to correct social errors done against Muslim women. According to them, a new form of Islamic law is being developed, to forbid practices such as female genital mutilation. People developing this law also want to make family codes (Personal law) equal, allow women to become clergy, or to help in mosques in other ways. They want women to be able to become judges in civil and religious institutions. Elewa and Silvers say that modern scholars see their work as restoration of rights provided by God and the prophet but denied by society.

As of the 2020s, there are many changes in the Muslim world. States where Islam is an important religion are often run by a single ruler, or a small group of people. These stats will need to change so that people can elect who represents them. Such a process is called democratic. When they go through this change, they will need to look to improve the situation of the people as to human rights, social justice and gender equality. Islamic feminists play an important role in this process. For example, in 2012, Jordanian women protested against laws that allowed the charge of rape to be dropped, if the rapist marries his victim, Tunisian women marched for equality for women in a new constitution, Saudi women protested against the ban against car driving, Sudanese women created a silent wall of protest demanding freedom for arrested women. Elizabeth Segran describes the Islamic feminist struggle of Malaysian activist Zainah Anwar. Segran says that just talking about human rights mentioned in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) does not create a direct response with ordinary women. Islam is the source of their values. For this reason, integrating human rights frameworks with Islam makes sense.

Islamists are advocates of political Islam. In their view the Quran and hadith want to establish a caliphate, an Islamic government. Some islamists say that women should have rights in public life. They do however not challenge gender inequality in the personal, private sphere.

Su'ad al-Fatih al-Badawi, a Sudanese academic and Islamist politician, has argued that feminism is incompatible with "taqwa" (the Islamic idea of piety). In al-Badawi's view, Islam and feminism are mutually exclusive. Margot Badran of Georgetown University's Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (now the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding) argues that Islam and feminism are not mutually exclusive and that "Islamic feminism, which [takes] its understanding and mandate from the Qur'an, seeks rights and justice for women, and for men, in [all] of their existence. Islamic feminism is both highly contested and firmly embraced."

Modern ideas of Islamic feminism started in the 19th century.. The Iranian poet Táhirih was the first modern woman to undertake Qur'anic exegesis. She was born and raised in a traditional Muslim family. Later, she became a prominent member of the Bábí Faith. During this time was openly against polygyny, the wearing of the veil, and other restrictions put on women. One of her most notable quotes are her final words before her execution in August 1852, "You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women."

Egyptian jurist Qasim Amin wrote the book "Women's Liberation" ("Tahrir al-Mar'a"), in 1899. This book probably started the feminist movement in Egypt. In his work, Amin criticized some of the practices which were common in his society at the time: These were polygyny, the veil, and "purdah", i.e. sex segregation in Islam, amongst others. He condemned them as un-Islamic and contradictory to the true spirit of Islam. His work had an enormous influence on women's political movements throughout the Islamic and Arab world

Amin had a big effect on modern-day Islamic feminist movements. Despite this, present-day scholar Leila Ahmed considers his works both androcentric and colonialist. Muhammad 'Abdu, an Egyptian nationalist and proponent of Islamic modernism, could easily have written the chapters of his work that show honest considerations of the negative effects of the veil on women. Amin also uses many male misconceptions about women: In his view, women are unable to experience love. Women also talk about their husbands when they are not present. He also thinks that Muslim marriage is based on ignorance and sensuality, of which women were the main source.

Amin was not the first to criticize the society he lived in. There were many women who did. The women's press in Egypt started voicing such concerns since its very first issues in 1892. Egyptian, Turkish, Iranian, Syrian and Lebanese women and men had been reading European feminist magazines even a decade earlier, and discussed their relevance to the Middle East in the general press.
Twentieth century
Aisha Abd al-Rahman, used her pen name "Bint al-Shati" ("Daughter of the Riverbank"), when she wrote. She was the second modern woman to do Quranic exegesis. She didn't think of herself as a feminist. Despite this, her works have feminist themes. She began producing her popular books in 1959, the same year that Naguib Mahfouz published his allegorical and feminist version of the life of Muhammad. She wrote biographies of early women in Islam, including the mother, wives and daughters of the Prophet Muhammad, as well as literary criticism. Fatema Mernissi has argued that much of the suppression of women's rights in Islamic societies is the result of political motivation and its consequent manipulative interpretation of hadith, which is against the egalitarian Islamic community of men and women Muhammad had in mind.

Some versions of modern Islamic feminism do not use hadith at all, and only focus on the priciples written down in the Qu'ran. Riffat Hassan has advocated one such movement. She started a theology where what are seen as universal rights for humanity outlined in the Qur'an are prioritized over contextual laws and regulations. In addition, she claims, that if only the Qu'ran is taken as scripture, there is no story that women were created after men, or a story that they started the "Fall of Man". Other Muslim feminists have criticized this idea: They say it is too picky and ignores other elements of the Muslim tradition that could be helpful in making Islamic society more egalitarian.

The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) is a women's organization based in Quetta, Pakistan.

It promotes women's rights and secular democracy. The organization wants to involve women of Afghanistan in both political and social activities. In this way, they should get their human rights. RAWA will also continuing the struggle against the government of Afghanistan. RAWA thinks the Afghan government should be based on democratic and secular ideas - not fundamentalist - principles, in which women can participate fully.

A group of intellectuals led by Meena founded the group in 1977. At the time, Meena did not use a last name. They founded the organization to promote equality and education for women. Even if Meena was assassinated because of her views, RAWA continues to "give voice to the deprived and silenced women of Afghanistan". Before 1978, RAWA focused mainly on women's rights and democracy, but after the coup of 1978, directed by Moscow, and the 1979 Soviet Occupation of Afghanistan, "Rawa became directly involved in the war of resistance, advocating democracy and secularism from the outset". In 1979 RAWA campaigned against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, and organized meetings in schools to mobilize support against it, and in 1981, launched a bilingual feminist magazine, "Payam-e-Zan" (Women's Message). RAWA also founded Watan Schools to aid refugee children and their mothers, offering both hospitalization and the teaching of practical skills.

In 2015 a group of Muslim activists, politicians, and writers issued a Declaration of Reform. This declaration also supports women's rights and states in part, "We support equal rights for women, including equal rights to inheritance, witness, work, mobility, personal law, education, and employment. Men and women have equal rights in mosques, boards, leadership and all spheres of society. We reject sexism and misogyny." The Declaration also announced the founding of the Muslim Reform Movement organization to work against the beliefs of Middle Eastern terror groups. In 2015 Asra Nomani and others placed the Declaration on the door of the Islamic Center of Washington.

Feminism in the Middle East is over a century old. The war on terror in Afghanistan directly affected it. It continues to grow and fight for women's rights and equality in all conversations of power and everyday life. There is currently a debate about what the status of women in Islam should be like. Both conservative and Islamic femininists use the same sources for their arguments: The Quran, the hadith, and prominent women in Muslim history. Feminists say that early Islam was more egalitarian; conservatives say that the gender assymmetries are "divinely ordained".

"Phrynomedusa" frogs live in mountain streams and nearby ponds in the Atlantic Forest. The female frogs lay their egg clutches in cracks in the rocks above the water; the tadpoles grow in the water.

"Phrynomedusa" are rare and humans do not know much about them. Except for "P. appendiculata" and "P. marginata", scientists have only seen a few individual frogs from each species. Conservationists are sure that two species live in protected areas, but they do not know about the other frogs.

"Phrynomedusa" are small tree frogs: adult males are from nose to rear end, and females . The iris has two colors: a horizontal dark stripe in middle of the eye with dark yellow in the upper and lower surfaces. The back of this frog is smooth. There is only a little webbing on its front and back feet. They do not have flash colors on their sides, thighs, or othe rbody parts, like other phyllomedusid frogs do. Males frogs have vocal sacs and vocal slits.

There are six species, and one of them is probably extinct:

Nasal cycle

The nasal cycle is the alternating partial nasal congestion and decongestion of the nose cavities. It occurs in humans and other mammals. The individual is usually not aware that it happens. 

It results in greater airflow through one nostril, and regular alternation between the nostrils. The hypothalamus selectively activates each half of the autonomic nervous system in turn. The phenomenon is quite normal.

The cilia of the congested side suspend their motility until that side decongests. The cycle means that, at any time, one side of the nose is moist, and moistens the incoming air. This is one of the three functions of the nose. The other two are the filtration and warming of fresh air before it gets to the lungs.

It is not entirely clear what the benefit is of this system.

Bread and butter

Among them are Turkmen melons, which are the result of farmers' hard work and which have a unique taste reminiscent of the fruit of paradise." Newspapers say he has said "The Turkmen melon is the source of our pride. Its taste has no equals in the world, the smell makes your head spin."

Sara Innamorato

Sara G. Innamorato (born April 1986, Ross Township, Pennsylvania) is an American politician. In 2018, Innamorato was elected into the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. From January 2019 on she was the Representative from the House of Representatives' 21st district. She is a member of the United States' Democratic Party

Before starting politics, Innamorato began Innamo Company (a privately held and marketing company that has focus on "social good"). She then co-founded She Runs SWPA. That organization was not connected with any political party. She Runs SWPA wants women and girls to run for any office related to politics and federal government.


Innamorato was a member of the United States' Democratic Socialists of America. She won the Democratic Party's nomination. She defeated the incumbent Don Costa in the 2018 primary election while having just over 64% of the vote.

Innamorato was unopposed in the 2018 general election. She later said: "My district, which I know is like white working class, poor folk, who are racist, because it’s so much easier for them to look to their side and say, ‘I’m going to blame that person.'" The Costa campaign head Gary Britcher then said that Innamorato had called the district "racist". Innamorato's point was that white working class voters "are being exploited from all sides" by economic and political elites who play on racial tensions to distract them from issues of economic injustice. "Racism exists everywhere," she said. "My job is to represent everyone, and to not shy away from tough conversations."

Innamorato got almost 85% of the vote in the general election.

Innamorato's opponent was Stephen Zappala III for the Democratic Party nomination. He is the son of the Allegheny County District Attorney. He quietly withdrew his campaign the next month. Innamorato was unopposed on the ballot for the Democratic Party nomination.

Phrynomedusa appendiculata

The Santa Catarina leaf frog or Lutz's Phyllomedusa ("Phrynomedusa appendiculata") is a frog that lives in Brazil. Scientists have seen it between 800 and 1000 meters above sea level.

Scientists last saw this frog in 2012 in a park called the Parque Estadual Nascentes do Paranapanema. Scientists believe this frog is in big danger of dying out. They may all be dead now. Scientists believe that some frogs may still be alive in Serra do Mar, where there are forests in protected parks. Scientists believe the frogs died because of sickness and dirty air and humans changing the forests where they lived from coal mining. Scientists are worried that people will try to catch these frogs to sell as pets because the frog is so colorful and rare and because many other frogs in "Phrynomedusa" are sold as pets, but the scientists are not sure if it is happening now.

This frog needs healthy rainforest where the tree branches come together like a roof. The frog sits on smaller plants. The female frog lays her eggs on leaves over water. The tadpoles fall into the water when they hatch. Scientists have seen the frogs laying eggs in ponds where the water looks black.
