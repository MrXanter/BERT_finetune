Antiviral drug

Viruses are the ultimate expression of parasitism. They not only take nutrition from the host cell but also direct it metabolic machinery to synthesize new virus particles. viral chemotherapy was considered impossible, as it would require interference with cellular metabolism in the host.

1. Anti-Herpes virus : idoxurudine, trifluridine, Acyclovir, valacyclovir, Famciclovir, Ganciclovir, Valganciclovir, Cidofovir, Foscarnet, Fomivirsen

2. Anti-Influenza virus: Amantadine, rimantadine, Oseltamivir, Zanamivir

3. Anti-Hepatitis virus/nonselective antiviral drugs Primarily for hepatitis B: Lamivudine, Adefovir dipivoxil, Tenofovir Primarily for hepatitis C: Ribavirin, Interferon α

4. Anti retrovirus:

(A) neucleoside rivers transcriptas inhibitor: Zidovudine

Didanosine, Stavudine, lamivudine, Abacavir, Emtricitabine, Tenofovir

(B) nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): Nevirapine, Efavirenz, Delavirdine

(C) Protease inhibitors: Ritonavir, Atazanavir, Indinavir, Nelfinavir, Saquinavir, Amprenavir

(D) Entry (Fusion) inhibitor: Enfuvirtide

(E) CCR5 receptor inhibitor: Maraviroc

(F) Integrase inhibitor: Raltegravir

This deoxiguanosine analogue antiviral drug requires a virus specific enzyme for conversion to the active metabolite that inhibits DNA synthesis and viral replication.

Acyclovir is  taken by the virus infected cells. Because of selective generation of the active inhibitor in the virus infected cell and its greater inhibitory effect on viral DNA synthesis, acyclovir has low toxicity for host cells: a several hundred-fold chemotherapeutic index has been noted.

Only about 20% of an oral dose of acyclovir is absorbed. It is little plasma protein bound and is widely distributed attaining CSF concentration that is 50% of plasma concentration. After topical application, it penetrates cornea well. Acyclovir is primarily excreted unchanged in urine, both by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion; plasma t½ is 2–3 hours.







Chemically, it is a unique tricyclic amine unrelated to any nucleic acid precursor, but inhibits replication of influenza A virus. the activity of amantadine is strain specific, influenza b is not affected. H5N1 and H1N1 strains of Influenza A are resistant in most areas. it appears to act an early step (possibly uncoating) as well as at a late step (viral assembly) in viral replication. protein designated M2 which acts as an Ion channel has been identify as one of is targets of action. Resistance to amantadine develops by mutation causing amino acid substitutions in the M2 protein.





Nausea, Anorexia, Insomnia, Dizziness, Nightmares, Lack of mental concentration, Rarely Hallucinations have been reported. Ankle edema occurs due to local vasoconstriction.

α Interferons (IFNs)are low molecular weight glycoprotein cytokines produced by host cells in response to viral infections, TNFα, IL-1 and some other inducers.

They have nonspecific antiviral activity as well as other complex effects on immunity and cell proliferation. interferons binds to a very specific cell surface receptors and affect its replication at multiple steps,  viral penetration, synthesis of viral mRNA, assembly of viral particles and their release, but the most widespread effect is direct or indirect suppression of viral protein synthesis, i.e. inhibition of translation. interfeorn receptor like JAK STAT tyrosine protein kinase receptors which on activation phosphorylate cellular proteins. These then migrate to the nucleus and induce transcription of ‘interferon-inducedproteins’ which exert antiviral effects






Antiviral drugs are a type of drug used for treating viral infection. Most antivirals are used for specific viral infections, while a broad-spectrum antiviral works against a wide range of viruses. Unlike most antibiotics, antiviral drugs do not destroy their target pathogen (something that causes disease); instead they stop their development.

Antiviral drugs are a type of antimicrobials, a larger group which also includes antibiotic (also called antibacterial), antifungal and antiparasitic drugs, or antiviral drugs based on monoclonal antibodies. Most antivirals do not cause much damage to the body, and can be used to treat infections. They are different from viricides, which are not medicine but deactivate or destroy virus particles inside or outside the body. Natural antivirals are made by some plants such as eucalyptus and Australian tea trees.

Antimicrobial

An antimicrobial is an agent that kills microorganisms or stops their growth. Antimicrobial medicines can be grouped according to the microorganisms they act primarily against. For example, antibiotics are used against bacteria, and antifungals are used against fungi. They can also be classified according to their function. Agents that kill microbes are microbicidal, while those that merely stop their growth are called biostatic. The use of antimicrobial medicines to treat infection is known as antimicrobial chemotherapy, while the use of antimicrobial medicines to prevent infection is called antimicrobial prophylaxis.

The main types of antimicrobial agents are disinfectants (such as bleach), which kill a wide range of microbes on non-living surfaces to prevent the spread of illness, antiseptics (which are applied to living tissue and help reduce infection during surgery), and antibiotics (which kill microorganisms within the body). The term "antibiotic" originally described only those creations that came from living microorganisms but is now also applied to synthetic agents, such as sulfonamides or fluoroquinolones. The term also used to be only applied to antibacterials, but its meaning has widened to include all antimicrobials. Antibacterial agents can be further grouped into bactericidal agents, which kill bacteria, and bacteriostatic agents, which slow down or stall bacterial growth. In response, further advancements in antimicrobial technologies have resulted in solutions that can go past simply stopping germ growth. Instead, certain types of porous media have been made to kill microbes on contact.

Pharmacotheraphy

Pharmacotherapy is therapy using medication, as separate from therapy using surgery (surgical therapy), radiation (radiation therapy), movement (physical therapy), or other methods. Among physicians, sometimes the term medical therapy refers specifically to pharmacotherapy as separate to surgical or other therapy; for example, in oncology, medical oncology is differentiated from surgical oncology. Pharmacists are experts in pharmacotherapy and are responsible for ensuring the safe, appropriate, and economical use of pharmaceutical drugs. The skills required to function as a pharmacist require knowledge, training and experience in biomedical, pharmaceutical and clinical sciences. Pharmacology is the science that aims to continually improve pharmacotherapy. The pharmaceutical industry and academia use basic science, applied science, and translational science to create new pharmaceutical drugs.

ICQ

ICQ is a cross-platform instant messaging and VoIP client. The name ICQ derives from the English phrase "I Seek You". Originally developed by the Israeli company Mirabilis in 1996, the client was bought by AOL in 1998, and then by Mail.Ru Group in 2010.

The ICQ client application and service were initially released in November 1996, freely available to download. ICQ was among the first stand-alone instant messenger (IM)—while real-time chat was not in itself new (Internet Relay Chat (IRC) being the most common platform at the time), the concept of a fully centralized service with individual user accounts focused on one-on-one conversations set the blueprint for later instant messaging services like AIM, and its influence is seen in modern social media applications. ICQ became the first widely adopted IM platform.

At its peak around 2001, ICQ had more than 100 million accounts registered. At the time of the Mail.Ru acquisition in 2010, there were around 42 million daily users. Since 2013, ICQ has 11 million monthly users.

BC Transit

BC Transit is a transit company run by the British Columbian government that gives bus services to many towns and areas in the province.

Before 1979, the power company, BC Hydro, ran the buses. In 1979, the province made the transit company into a separate agency called the Urban Transit Authority which became BC Transit in 1983.

BC Transit transit plans the routes and schedules but doesn't run the buses in most of the province. In 1999, a new company called TransLink was made to run the buses, metro, and trains in Vancouver. BC Transit might give more areas to TransLink one day.

A company called the BC Electric Railway was made in 1897 to replace the Consolidated Railway Company, which had run the streetcars in Victoria, Vancouver and New Westminster. Slowly the streetcars and interurban trains were changed to electric trolley and gas-powered buses. The province made BC Hydro in 1962 to take over when the old company ran out of money.

In 1979, the government made the Urban Transit Authority, to plan and make rules for public transit; and the Metro Transit Operating Company, a separate crown corporation that actually ran the buses. The new structure was meant to provide local governments with more decision-making power and funding of their local systems. BC Transit was in 1982.

In 1999, Vancouver's transit system started to be controlled by a difference company, TransLink.

In 2018, BC Transit started running its first intercity buses in Northern British Columbia after Greyhound Canada stopped running buses in the province. In 2019, drivers got safety doors to stop people from hurting them. During the COVID outbreak in March 2020, BC Transit made buses free everywhere in the province and let people get on in the back door. This lasted until June 1, 2020.

The Victoria Regional Transit System, in the capital, is the only system where the buses are run by BC Transit. Outside Victoria, the bus schedules and routes are made by BC Transit but the buses are driven by other companies. In four places (Nanaimo, Nelson, Powell River, and the Sunshine Coast) the towns run the buses.

BC Transit runs buses for people who have difficulty getting around. These buses are called paratransit and people call for the service to pick them up and drop them off ahead of time.

Because lots of small towns don't have hospitals and doctors, there are also some buses that run from small towns into big cities. These buses don't run often, but they're still very important.

Geometric mean

The geometric mean is a number, which is used to represent a set of numbers. It is calculated by taking the n-th root of the product of these numbers. In symbols, if we have formula_1 numbers formula_2, the geometric mean is
formula_3
What most people refer to when they talk about mean or average is the arithmetic mean. The geometric mean is almost always smaller than the arithmetic mean. In some cases, it is equal. The geometric mean is often used in finance and in statistics.

Because there's a product, it does not make sense to calculate the geometric mean if one of the numbers is zero. It generally also does not make much sense to calculate it when one of them is a negative number. It isn't used for complex numbers, because calculating the root of a complex number has more than one result.

Mastic ice creams

Mastic ice creams (resin based ice cream) is popularly termed for stretchy and sticky textured ice cream, named after the spice - "Mastic (Pistacia lentiscus resin)". These ice creams are based on of Salep or cornflower, rose water, and the "Mastic resin" that contributes to the texture (as opposed to the texture of other ice creams that have a more airy texture) and are commonly used in Middle Eastern cuisine. Today, due to the very high price of the gum spice and the difficulty of obtaining it, there are ice cream sellers who usually replace it with glucose or other ice cream conducive to appear as a sticky dish.

Mastic ice cream was first invented in Turkey during the Ottoman Empire and was called: "Dondurma" and it has been around for 300 years when its recipe was kept secret for many years. there are places in Turkey where it is customary to put the ice cream in a large container equipped with huge spoons for constant stirring, so that you do not over-firm, and serve it in a plate with a knife and fork. The ice cream is very popular in Turkey and there are even street stalls especially for Turkish Mastic ice cream where they pour boiling chocolate syrup over an ice cream cup. There are ice cream vendors who practice juggling and street shows for tourists with ice cream because of its great flexibility and resistance to melting. The ice cream's massive publicity in Turkey has made Istanbul's neighborhood known as "Dondorma".

In the middle of the 19th century a Syrian merchant brought the secret recipe of ice cream from Turkey to Damascus, where he developed a softer local version of ice cream called "Booza", which is lighter And airy from the Turkish version, and from there it was distributed to Arab countries. in the Middle East only sells the Arabic version of the ice cream, while in the Far East only the Turkish version of the ice cream sells.


Definite description

In logic, a definite description is a term of the form 'the ...'. It is used to describe something. This is more difficult than it first appears, because:

Unfortunately, language allows to construct sentences, where the thing or person talked about is not unique, or it doesn't exist

Definite descriptions are called 'empty', if they violate one of the conditions above: Bertrand Russell used the sentence "The present king of Freance is bald.". When Russel wrote this, in the early 20th century, France was a republic, and had no king.

Other famous mathematicians who wrote about it include Gottlob Frege, and Peter Strawson.

Six people were indicted with rape, attempted murder, robbery, and causing a riot:


Raymond Santana and Kevin Richardson were among the first suspects to be arrested.

On May 1, 1989, Donald Trump took out ads in New York City newspapers. In these ads, he said that the death penalty should be used again and called for the five suspects to be executed. Back then, the state of New York had stopped executing people. 

The Supreme Court said in 1977 during the "Coker v. Georgia" case that people cannot be executed for committing rape. They knew that false rape accusations were used to kill black men or put them in jail.

The convictions of the five suspects were vacated after it was revealed that they were forced to confess.

Also, another man was identified as the rapist. His name was Matias Reyes.

The five men who were convicted sued the city. They got $40 million dollars in all, $1 million for each year they were behind bars. Trump said that the city should not have given them money and that the men didn't have "the pasts of angels."

Trisha Meili wrote a book about her experiences. It is called "I Am the Central Park Jogger". She is now an inspirational speaker. She talks about sexual assault and brain injury.

Antron McCray now lives in Georgia. He is married and has six kids.

Kevin Richardson lives in New Jersey. He is an activist who focuses on reforms in the criminal justice system.

Yusef Salaam lives in Georgia. He is an activist who focuses on reforms in the criminal justice system.

Raymond Santana also lives in Georgia. He is an activist who focuses on reforms in the criminal justice system.

Korey Wise lives in New York City. He changed his name from Karey. He is an activist who focuses on reforms in the criminal justice system.

It has been claimed that the newspaper ads made Trump look racist. Trump is white, while the suspects were Black and Latino.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said that the suspects were guilty. 

Trump was later elected as the 45th President of the United States. He was president from 2017 to 2021. As of July 2020, he has never apologized for the newspaper ads.

Playdate (console)

Playdate is an handheld video game console by Panic that came out in 2020, however it was delayed from releasing to most people until April 18, 2022. It was first introduced on May 22, 2019 on the cover of Edge magazine. Panic worked with Teenage Engineering, a Swedish consumer electronics company, to design the Playdate.

The Playdate has a black-and-white 1-bit screen, 4 way directional pad, two game buttons, and a mechanical crank on the side.

The Playdate allows games that are not part of a season to be sideloaded without needing to jailbreak it. Games were made using an SDK that came with a simulator and debugger and worked with C and Lua, programming languages. It is only available with the developer kit for Mac. However, in a response, Playdate said they were open to creating software for Windows, and compiling was already available, and the simulator is a work in progress.

The screen technology used is Sharp's Memory LCD, which has some features of e-paper displays. Each pixel can remember if it is black or white without having to be refreshed, resulting in faster refreshing and lower power usage, whilst also being "viewable in any light, from edge-of-vision darkness to brightest sunlight" and having a wide 170° viewing angle.

Games for the handheld came out in 12-game "seasons". A new game was sent over Wi-Fi every week. Each game's contents was kept secret until the week it came out, and would be automatically downloaded. The first season of games were included in the price of the console. Video games were made by Panic, and notable indie game developers such as Keita Takahashi, Zach Gage, Bennett Foddy, Shaun Inman, and Chuck Jordan. Later game titles included "Crankin's Time Travel Adventure", "b360", "Zipper", "Executive Golf DX, Snak, and Sasquatchers".

In a developer survey, Panic said they would like to include games by underrepresented developers, and said season one would contain games by women, and games by "queer/trans/enby" people.

In May 2019, Panic were told off after the details of an email they had sent to an indie video game event that was also named Playdate said to change "their" name to avoid confusion. The next day, one of Panic's founders cancelled the request, saying "My intention was always to find a way for our Playdates to co-exist [...] but we remain fine with you using the name Playdate." On January 29, 2020, the team behind the event (now named "Playdate Pop Up") announced Panic were joining the event as a sponsor, and would help the event to be considered as non-profit.

To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants

"To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants" is the second part of the sixteenth episode of the sixth season of "SpongeBob SquarePants". It was first shown on television on July 17, 2009 as a part of the television marathon called "The Ultimate SpongeBob SpongeBash Weekend." A DVD version of the episode was made on July 21, 2009 and has other season six episodes in it.

A narrator tells about the time SpongeBob changes his pants by starting with SpongeBob puttting his pairs of pants in a dryer. Patrick calls him and makes noises with his tongue. When Patrick stops, SpongeBob checks the dryer and finds out his pants have shrunk. A mall worker tells him that square pants will not be shipped in months. SpongeBob then looks around the mall for a different type of pants. He ends up finding a pair of round pants and decides to buy them. SpongeBob later meets Patrick, who does not recognize him in his round pants. Sandy and Squidward pretend to not recognize him either. Patrick won't let SpongeBob in his house because he says the house belongs to SpongeBob SquarePants.

SpongeBob thinks no one will recognize him in his round pants, so he goes to the Krusty Krab to get hired again. Mr. Krabs does not pretend to not recognize SpongeBob and tells him to get to work. Squidward shows SpongeBob how to be a bad worker without telling him in hopes of getting him fired. Mr. Krabs catches Squidward and SpongeBob sleeping on the job and gets mad. SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that he can not be "SpongeBob SquarePants" because of his round pants. Mr. Krabs tells him to just take off his round pants, leaving him in his underwear. Sandy teases SpongeBob by calling him "SpongeBob UnderPants," making him scream and ending the episode.

Paul Mavis of DVD Talk gave a positive response and says that "There are laughs in 'To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants.'" Judge Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict gave the episode a score of 5 out of 10 and said that "[the episode] was one of the slighter entries [on the DVD] with the core joke being fairly well-handled with no one recognizing SpongeBob, but it went on just a little too long."

Apocalypse Cow

"Apocalypse Cow" is the seventeenth episode of the nineteenth season of The Simpsons. It was first shown on television on April 27, 2008 on the Fox network. 7.69 million people watched the episode. In the episode, Bart joins 4-H and saves a cow named Lou. He gives it to a girl named Mary and her father, Cletus Spuckler, thinks that Bart wants to marry her. Jeff Westbrook won a Writers Guild of America Award for writing the episode.

Bart and Lisa watch a cartoon called "Transclown-O-Morphs." The main character tells kids to buy their new cereal to survive an emergency. Marge gets annoyed by the commercials and wants the kids to get away from TV. She gets Lisa to make banana bread and Bart to go to Shelbyville with Homer to have bean bag chairs "rebeaned." While driving, they see Martin Prince driving a combine harvester. Bart asks him why he would drive a combine harvester, and Martin says he joined 4-H. Bart joins and learns how to drive a tractor. A 4-H volunteer tells the members about a competition. He says you have to pick a calf and raise it over the summer, and the cattle will be judged at a county fair.

Bart gets stuck with a weaker cow and can not trade it away. He meets Mary, who gets Bart to not give up on the competition. Through the competition, Bart takes good care of the cow, which he names Lou, and makes him stronger and starts loving him. At the judging, Lou has grown up into a bull and is given a blue ribbon as an award. Bart is very happy until Lisa tells him that Lou will then be sent to a slaughterhouse.

Bart wants Marge and Homer to buy Lou, but do not want to because it is expensive. At night, Bart starts hearing mooing and thinks he is hallucinating, but Lisa tells him it is just a CD of animal sounds that she started playing. Bart, Lisa, and two friends, named Compost and Solar Panel, go to the slaughterhouse at midnight to save Lou. They find Lou and see that he has been fed growth hormone pills and is much bigger, so they use a forklift to move him away from the slaughterhouse. They decide that they should take Lou to Mary's house because it is on a farm. The next morning, they discover that Mary's father is Cletus Spuckler.

Bart gives Lou to Mary. Cletus yells for Brandine, Cletus' wife, to come to the door. Brandine learns about Bart giving Lou to Mary, so she tells Bart that giving a cow means that he has made a proposal of arranged marriage. Bart and Mary do not want a marriage, but Cletus and Brandine plan a wedding for the next day. Lisa tells Bart to go along with it so that they have enough time to figure out how to save Lou because she thinks that Cletus will not keep Lou if Bart doesn't want to get married to Mary. Homer and Marge learn about the wedding and are shocked, but Marge agrees to save Lou because Bart cares deeply for Lou. The next day, Marge stops the wedding and tells Cletus to send Lou to the slaughterhouse. However, Cletus ends up sending Homer in disguise as Lou. The real Lou is sent to India because cows have a sacred status in India. They then save Homer from the slaughterhouse after he nearly gets killed. Homer promises to eat less meat, and Bart says with pride that "I had a cow, man."

Richard Keller of TV Squad thought that the episode was another good episode of The Simpsons that feature Bart and Lisa together and says that "episodes that center around Bart and Lisa tend to be more interesting...because those characters have more dimensions, and their diverse personalities and passions [show that] there is more to explore about them." Robert Canning of IGN enjoyed the episode in a special way and was surprised by some plot elements, giving the episode a 7.5 out of 10. Matt Groening, creator of "The Simpsons", said that this episode was his favorite of the series in a 2008 interview and said that the scene with Homer in the slaughterhouse was the part he liked best.

Anti-Turkish sentiment

Anti-Turkism or Turkophobia is a term of being fearful, racist and discriminative against the Turkish people or Turkic countries.

The term refers to intolerance not only against the Turks across all regions, but also against Turkic groups as a whole, including Azerbaijanis, Crimean Tatars and Turkmens. It is also applied on groups who developed in part under the influence of Turkish culture and traditions while converting to Islam, especially during Ottoman times, such as Albanians, Bosniaks and other smaller ethnic groups around Balkans during the period of Ottoman rule. It can also refer to racism against Turkish people living outside of Turkey following the Turkish diaspora.

The main historical adversaries of Turkic peoples are considered to be Greeks, Armenians, Kurds, and Serbians. The main reasons for these historical conflicts lie in the annexation of their ancestral lands by Turkish colonists.

The roots of "anti-Turkism" can be traced back to the arrival of the Huns in Europe. While the ethnic background of the Huns is a matter of dispute among historians, they are widely believed to have been of Turkic origin, and their invasion inspired fear among Europeans. In the Late Middle Ages, the fall of Constantinople and the Ottoman wars in Europe — part of European Christians’ effort to stem the expansion of the Ottoman Empire, the predecessor to Turkey — helped fuel the development of "anti-Turkism".

Gamergate controversy

The Gamergate controversy is a popular nickname for a controversy about women and video games as well as ethics in video game journalism.

Zoë Quinn designed a video game called Depression Quest about a person who struggles with depression. Several video game journalists praised the game while others said that it was too dark to be a good game. People in the second group claimed that the only reason Quinn’s game was popular was because of people who cared more about feminism and political correctness than about video games. Then, Quinn’s ex-boyfriend started a blog wherein he falsely accused her of having had sex with a male video game journalist in exchange for good reviews. That journalist pointed out that he had never reviewed the game at all and argued that the accusation made no sense. After that a lot of people still started to not only criticize, but also bullying Zoe Quinn on the Internet, including threats of murder, rape or commit other kinds of violence against Quinn. When people came to Quinn’s defense and said that the attacks against Quinn were proof of sexism against video game designers who were not male, they were accused of being social justice warriors (SJWs). Milo Yiannopoulos supported Quinn’s attackers on Breitbart and said that anybody who did not support her attackers was being too politically correct.

Homer becomes popular with the women he helps Moe with. Patty and Selma tell Marge that Homer would not try to be clever if he really liked Marge's new hair. Two women behind them talk about Homer at a club, making Marge jealous. While she tries to go over to the club, a couple of accidents make her look like a witch.

Band Geeks

"Band Geeks" is the second part of the fifteenth episode of the second season of "SpongeBob SquarePants". It was first shown on television on September 7, 2001. The episode played the song "Sweet Victory" by David Glen Eisley. In the episode, Squidward tells a lie to his high school enemy, Squilliam Fancyson, that he has a marching band. He gets people from Bikini Bottom to join his band, but they play badly. Squidward quits the band, but SpongeBob gets the band together and practices for a big concert. Squidward thinks the concert will go wrong, but the concert is a success. The episode won the 2002 Golden Reel Awards for Best Sound Editing in Television – Animation.

Squidward gets a call from his old high school enemy, Squilliam Fancyson. Squilliam tells Squidward about his very good life and that he is doing everything Squidward wishes he could do. Squilliam then tells Squidward that his band will be performing at the Bubble Bowl. Squidward gets jealous and lies that he has a marching band and that it will play in the Bubble Bowl instead. After the call, Squidward quickly assembles a marching band with the people of Bikini Bottom.

Squidward has one week to prepare a concert for the Bubble Bowl. The band plays badly through the training. On the first day, Patrick and Sandy get into a fight. On the second day, two flag twirlers are killed when they spin their flags too fast and crash into a blimp. On the third day, Plankton tries to play the harmonica, but the holes are bigger than he is and he gets tired of running to each hole. On the fourth (and last) day, the band plays too loudly, breaking the windows of the building. All of the band then gets into a fight. When class is over, Squidward goes over to the doors and says that he is disappointed in the band for fighting and no longer wants his band to play in the Bubble Bowl. Once Squidward leaves, SpongeBob tells everyone to go through and perform at the Bubble Bowl to make Squidward happy.

On the day of the concert, Squilliam finds Squidward at the Bubble Bowl entrance to see his band play poorly. Squidward says that his band died, but all of the band show up behind Squidward and say they are ready to perform. They enter a dome which takes them to the Bubble Bowl field. Squidward starts conducting with fear that the band will play poorly, but they play successfully. The band performs a song called "Sweet Victory." At the end of the episode, Squilliam faints and Squidward leaps in the air with a cheerful face.

The episode is largely said to be one of the best episodes of the show. Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob, said it is one of his favorite episodes. Michael Cavna of "The Washington Post" said that Squidward's artistic traits and roles in the episode "made this a kids' episode that adults can experience on a whole 'nother level." "The Guardian" said the episode is the second best episode of the show, behind the episode "Krusty Krab Training Video". The episode along with another season two episode, "The Secret Box", have the highest rating out of all of the other "SpongeBob SquarePants" on IMDb with a rating of 9.8 out of 10.

After Stephen Hillenburg, creator of "SpongeBob SquarePants", died, a user on Change.org started a petition for the NFL to include the featured music "Sweet Victory" on the halftime of Super Bowl LIII. The petition got 1.1 million signatures on January 11, 2019. On December 18, 2018, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the stadium used for Super Bowl LIII, posted a scene from the episode on their Twitter page. On January 13, Maroon 5 released a video on Twitter that had a SpongeBob SquarePants episode included for a second.

During the halftime show, a short animation showing Squidward and the scene with the trumpet fanfare was used to introduce Travis Scott, a guest singer for the halftime show. Many fans of SpongeBob were mad because the NFL did not play the full song. However, "Sweet Victory" increased 566% on on-demand streaming when shown on the halftime show. Because of this, the song entered "Billboard"'s United States Hot Rock Songs chart at number 23 and the Kid Digital Song Sales chart at number two, behind Pinkfong's "Baby Shark."

Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage (né Schreibvogel; born March 5, 1963), also called Joe Exotic, is an American jailed criminal and former zoo operator. He was born in Garden City, Kansas.

Exotic owned and ran the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma. He is known as a tiger breeder. He ran for public office twice: first for President of the United States in 2016 as an independent and then for Governor of Oklahoma in 2018 as a Libertarian.

In 2019, Exotic was convicted on 17 federal charges of animal abuse and two counts of murder for hire. He allegedly hired a man to kill Big Cat Rescue CEO Carole Baskin. He was given a 22-year sentence in federal prison. In July 2021, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that this sentence was long.

In 2020, Netflix released a 7-part documentary, "". It talked about Exotic, his zoo, and his fight with Baskin.

In prison, Exotic was put in quarantine in a security housing unit because he had been in contact with someone who had COVID-19. He was moved to "a room with a hospital bed and a WINDOW" after his fans wrote many letters to the prison. As of July 2021, Exotic is in prison in Texas.

Exotic is openly gay.

In May 2021, Exotic said that he had prostate cancer. In August 2021, he said that his cancer might have spread to his pelvis.

In March 2023, Exotic announced his candidacy for President of the United States for the Libertarian nomination in the 2024 election. The following month, he withdrew from the Libertarian primary and instead chose to run for the Democratic Party nomination.

COVID-19 vaccine

A COVID-19 vaccine is any of the vaccines used against COVID-19 (a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus). In July 2020, more than 150 vaccines were being developed in different laboratories. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, were approved late in 2020. Both are over 90% effective. A few vaccines also went into use in early 2021.

Several countries planned to give the vaccine to many people, but their plans were different. The United Kingdom used its National Health Service. Canada used its military. The United States sent vaccines to all fifty states and the state governments each made their own system.

The United Kingdom approved the Pfizer vaccine before the European Union or United States did. They began giving it to people on December 8, 2020. The United States began giving people the vaccine on December 14, starting with health care workers in New York City. By April 2021, several vaccines were in use around the world and hundreds of millions of people had been vaccinated.
Covid vaccination started for children aged 12-14 in India on 16 March 2022 

In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)which is organizing a billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidatesindicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than 12 months or by early 2021. On 4May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon (fundraising event broadcasted via televisions) to raise billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. The United States government started Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine by January 2021.

PittCoVacc is a vaccine invented by scientists from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania in the United States. It was invented to protect people from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It was the first vaccine candidate, meaning vaccine that scientists thought would work well, published in a peer-reviewed study, meaning a scientific paper that other vaccine experts had read and approved before it was printed for people to read.

As of April 2020, it has been tested in mice but not in human beings.

PittCoVacc is short for "Pittsburgh coronavirus vaccine".

One of the head scientists, Dr. Andrea Gambotto, said they made the vaccine so quickly because they had worked on other coronaviruses before: "We had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014. These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus. That's why it's important to fund vaccine research. You never know where the next pandemic will come from."

The researchers used laboratory equipment to make pieces of the same proteins that are in SARS-CoV-2. They put the proteins inside the bodies of laboratory mice using a microneedle array, meaning a small patch with about 400 tiny needles made out of other protein and sugar. One of the scientists, Dr. Emrullah Korkmaz, said these needles melt away inside the skin after they release the vaccine. The skin is a good place to put a vaccine because it has many immune cells in it. Then the mice made antibodies, or protective molecules, in their blood. The scientists measured the amount of antibodies and guessed it would be enough to fight off the SARS-CoV-2 virus if the mice were exposed to it. It took about two weeks for the mice to make lots of antibodies.

The scientists said it would be easy to make large amounts of vaccine and large numbers of microneedle arrays to use on people.

Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01. They tested APN01 in engineered human tissue. These are human cells put together to act like part of the body, but they are not a whole animal or person. They added a protein called "human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2" (hrsACE2) and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells. They named their hrsACE2 APN01.

Other scientists have developed vaccines that use messenger RNA to teach the body to recognize the virus. They say mRNA vaccines take less time to develop and make, than protein or whole-virus vaccines.

Messenger RNA vaccines need to be stored at very cold temperatures. Ordinary refrigerators are not cold enough.

In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodiesbut they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021.

The Moderna vaccine entered stage-three clinical trials on June 27, 2020. That means it is being tested on humans. Dr. Anthony Fauci said he did not think the vaccine would be dangerous.

On November 16, Moderna said its vaccine was 94.5% effective. The vaccine has to kept colder than freezing but it does not have to be kept as cold as the Pfizer vaccine. Distribution began in February 2021.

The German company BioNTech and Pfizer made a deal with the United States government to make 100 million doses of mRNA vaccine by December 2020. The vaccine completed phase I trials and started its next trial on July 27, 2020. Instead of being a phase II trial or a phase III trial, Pfizer's team was trying to do both phases at once. If the companies could make the vaccine on time, the U.S. government would give them almost US$2 billion. The vaccine is called BNT162b2. BioNTech paid its employees overtime to do extra work. They called this "Project Lightspeed" because they wanted to develop the vaccine quickly.

Because they wanted people to trust the vaccine, Pfizer published the study protocols publicly. That means they told everyone exactly how they were testing the virus. This is information that companies usually keep secret so no one can steal their work.

On November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BNT162 was 90% effective at preventing people from catching COVID-19. They asked the FDA to approve the vaccine for emergency use. The company had not yet published the results of the study in a formal scientific paper, so the FDA said they needed time to look at the results for themselves.

The INN (International nonproprietary name) of this vaccine is tozinameran. INNs are a name for a particular vaccine or medicine to be used worldwide.

The adenovirus is the virus that causes the common cold. It does not harm the human body much. Scientists have used the adenovirus in vaccines for many years against many diseases. Scientists take pieces of dangerous viruses and attach them to adenovirus to then inject the adenovirus into the human body. The human immune system learns to recognize the pieces of dangerous viruses. After, it can fight off the real dangerous viruses if the human is ever exposed to them.

In late April 2020, a team from the University of Oxford said that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of Health tested it in rhesus monkeys and it worked. Because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. They would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020.

The team took the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and put it on an adenovirus. Then they injected that virus into test patients. The idea is that the patients' immune systems will learn to attack the spike protein no matter what virus it is on. This vaccine completed phase I trials and as of July 2020 is entering phase III trials. The vaccine is called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.

The Chinese company CanSino Biologics is making a viral vector vaccine. This vaccine uses an adenovirus that has the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 on it. Then the immune system learns to recognize the spike protein. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase II trials, but the Chinese government gave CanSino Biologics permission to give it to people anyway. They are allowed to give it to people in the Chinese military.

The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is made from the Johnson & Johnson company. Unlike many vaccines, it doesn't need special, unusual refrigeration.

The company Sinovac in China and Bututan research center in Brazil worked together. This is an inactivated virus vaccine. This means the team took the SARS-CoV-2 virus and changed it to make it harmless. The patient's body learns to recognize the harmless virus and then it can recognize the harmful, wild virus too. The company got permission to start phase III trials on July 3. This virus is called CoronaVac.

The company Sinopharm belongs to the government of China. It is an inactivated virus vaccine.
This vaccine started phase III trials in the middle of July 2020. This vaccine does not have a name.

The University of Melbourne and Murdoch Children's Research Institute are studying a vaccine that works against tuberculosis, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine. It is a live-bacterium vaccine. The patiebt gets dead "Mycobacterium tuberculosis" bacteria injected into them while training their immune system to fight it. Over the years, scientists saw that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine did not only protect people from tuberculosis, but it protected them from other diseases too. The scientists at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and University of Melbourne are studying the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine to see if it will protect people from COVID-19. Because this vaccine has already been used for other diseases for more than one hundred years, doctors already knew it was safe to use. As of July 2020, this vaccine is in phase III trials to see if it works on COVID-19.

Scientists believe a vaccine that doctors spray into the patient's nose would work better than a vaccine injected into the patient's veins. After a nasal vaccine, the body's immune cells look for the virus in the nose and mouth. The nose and mouth are where most people are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Scientists are not sure why this works. As of July 2020, teams in the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada are making nasal vaccines.

After his arrest, Einhorn fled the country and spent twenty-three years in Europe before being taken back to the United States. He said that his ex-girlfriend had been killed by CIA agents who framed him for the crime because he knew too much about the agency's paranormal military research. 

He was convicted and served a life sentence at a prison in Pennsylvania until his death in prison in April 2020 of heart disease, aged 79.

Synoptic Gospels

In the New Testament, the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, are written in a very similar style. They are referred to as the synoptic gospels.The forth of the evangelists, John, also tells similar stories, but his style of writing is different. The synoptic problem is to explain why three of the four evangelists have a very similar structure, and the fourth does not.


The strong parallelism among the three gospels suggests they were written at more or less the same time. Or, Matthew and Luke made use of the gospel of Mark as a source.

É

É or é is a letter that is not regularly found in the English language. It is the letter E with an acute accent above it. It can be found in the Afrikaans, Catalan, Danish, Emilian-Romagnol, French, Galician, Hungarian, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Kashubian, Luxembourgish, Occitan, Norwegian, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Vietnamese, and Welsh languages. In the English language, it can be found in loanwards (for example, "résumé" and "cliché") and romanizations (for example, "Pokémon").

É is the 9th letter of the Czech alphabet and the Slovak alphabet. In the IPA, it represents /ɛː/ in these languages.

In the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish languages, the letter É is used to show that the regular letter E is stressed. It is used to change the meaning of a word.

É is found in foreign words, mostly from French. It is also used to tell apart the Dutch words "een" (meaning "a" or "an" in English) and "één" (meaning the number one in English). It adds stress in the same way English sometimes uses italics. In Dutch, some people may use the Dutch word "hé" to greet eachother, meaning "hey" or "hi".

In Emilian, é is used as [e] in IPA (for example, "récc", meaning "rich" in English). In Romagnol, é is used as [eː] (for example, "lédar", meaning "thieves" in English).

The letter É appears in words that came from the French language. For example, née, résumé, fiancée, sauté, and coupé. It is also used in names, such as Beyoncé, Breneé, JonBenét, and Théo.

The letter É is widely used in French. It is pronounced as /e/ in IPA. Another french letter, È, is pronounced as /ɛ/. The two letters look the same, but they are not the same letter.

É is the 9th letter of the Hungarian alphabet and is used as /eː/ in IPA.

É is the 7th letter of the Icelandic alphabet and is used as /jɛː/ in IPA.

In Irish, an acute accent is used to mark a vowel as a long vowel. É is used as /eː/ in IPA.

É is used as /e/ in IPA and it carries a tonic accent. It is only used in the last letter of a word (except when a different wikt:pronunciation may change the meaning of a word). For example, "perché" (meaning "why" or "because" in English) and "pésca" (which means "fishing" in English). The letter È is also in the Italian alphabet, which is the letter E with a grave accent. Instead of /e/, the letter È is used as /ɛ/ in IPA.

É is the 8th letter of the Kashubian alphabet and is used as /ɛ/ in IPA. 

É is used to stress an /ɛ/ when the stressed syllable is not known that well (for example, "péssimo", meaning "very bad" in English). É can also mean the word "is", as in "ela é bonita" (meaning "she is pretty" in English). Another letter in Portuguese, the letter Ê, uses /e/. Ê is the letter E with a circumflex.

The letter é is pronounced the same as e (/e/). The accent marks the letter with a stressed syllable in words that do not usually have stress, such as "éxtasis" and "bebé".

The letter É used to be used in the Scottish Gaelic language, but it has been replaced with the letter È, an E with a grave accent.

The letter É is used to put stress on a short vowel. For example, "personél" (meaning "personnel" in English), "sigarét" (meaning "cigarette" in English), and "ymbarél" (meaning "umbrella" in English).

The letter É indicates a rising tone in Vietnamese. It can also be combined with a circumflex to make the letter "Ế".

Arupadai Veedu

The Six Abodes of Murugan (Tamil: "Āṟupadai veedu") are six temples in in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The god is known by different names. Thses include Kartikeya, Kanda, Vadivela and Murugan. The six most sacred abodes of Murugan were written about in Tamil sangam literature. They are mentioned in "Thirumurugatrupadai" by Nakkeerar and in "Thiruppugazh" by Arunagirinathar. The six abodes are Thiruparankundram, Tiruchendur, Palani, Swamimalai, Thiruthani and Pazhamudircholai.

The story of Lord Murugan is written about in Skanda Purana. Legend says that the demon Soorapadman tortured the Devas. They complained to Lord Vishnu and Brahma. Kamadeva was sent to wake Lord Shiva, who later gave birth to Kartikeya. Karthikeya killed Soorapadman and saved the devas. Muruga is shown as the god of love and war. Kartikeya married Valli and Deivayanai .

In Tamil literature five types of lands are explained. They are Kurinji (mountains), Mullai (forest), Marutham (agricultural), Neithal (coastal) and Palai (desert). Each land types has a defferent god. Lord Muruga is a leader of the Kurinji region.

Arunagirinathar was a 15th-century Tamil poet born in Tiruvannamalai. When he was young, he was a rioter and seducer of women. After ruining his health, he tried to kill himself. He did this by jumping from the northern tower of Annamalaiyar Temple. He was saved by the god Murugan. He became a staunch devotee and composed Tamil hymns glorifying Murugan, the most notable being "Thirupugazh". Arunagirinathar went to many Murugan temples. On his way back to Tiruvannamalai, he visited Palani. He sung songs about Swaminathaswamy. Tiruparamkundram is considered the first of the six abodes. This is the only temple where abishekam is performed for Vel instead of Lord Murugan. Palani is considered the most prominent abodes of Lord Muruga.

One of the main traditions of the six temples, is the tonsuring of devotees. They removed their hair to be like the Palani deity. Another tradition is the anointing of the head of the deity's idol with sandalwood paste. This is done at the end of the day before the temple closes. The paste is said to get medicinal properties. It is given to devotees, as "rakkāla chandaṇam".

Brett E. Crozier

Brett E. Crozier is an American naval officer. When he was captain of the aircraft carrier "Theodore Roosevelt", he noticed that some of his crew had caught COVID-19, a disease that affects the lungs and breathing. Late in March, 2020, he wrote letters asking for permission to send his sick sailors off his ship to Guam. These letters were found and printed in a newspaper. A few days later, the Navy fired Crozier as the captain of the "Theodore Roosevelt" but did not fire him from the Navy entirely. 

In late April, some leaders in the Navy asked that Crozier be reinstated and sent back as captain of the "Theodore Roosevelt".

Brett Crozier is from Santa Rosa, California. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1992 and became a pilot for the Navy in 1994. He fought in Iraq in 2003. He later earned a Master's Degree in National Security and Strategic Studies at the Naval War College. He served in many different positions in the Navy, including Executive Officer of the "USS Ronald Reagan". Brett Crozier was captain of the "USS Blue Ridge" from June 2017 to November 2018.

He wrote more than twenty copies of a four-page letter, dated March 30, 2020. He addressed it to senior officials in the military. He asked for permission to send 1000 of his crew off the ship. The ship had more than 4000 people on it. Someone found his messages and they were printed in the newspaper "San Francisco Chronicle" on March 31, 2020.

COVID-19 is very contagious, and people can catch it from other people easily. In the letter, Crozier said that the ship was too cramped to allow for sick sailors to do what the Centers for Disease Control and the Navy's own administration said people with COVID-19 should do: Keep away from other people for 14 days. He asked for permission to let his sick sailors go ashore to Guam, where the ship was docked at the time, and go into quarantine there instead of on board the ship. He copied part of a report about the "Diamond Princess" cruise ship, and said that even though the "Diamond Princess"'s passengers had private rooms, more than 100 people still became infected. He said the "Theodore Roosevelt" only had a few private rooms.

Retired Admiral James Stavridis, who used to be NATO Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, agreed that it was not possible to perform social distancing on board a navy ship like the "Theodore Roosevelt".

High-ranking leaders at the Navy said that removing Crozier from his ship was normal. They said Crozier should have asked for help by going through the chain of command instead of writing letters to other people in the military.

According to Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas B. Modly, Crozier's letter caused naval crews and their families to panic: "It undermines our efforts and the chain of command's efforts to address this problem and creates a panic. And creates a perception that the Navy's not on the job, the government's not on the job."

According to "The New York Times", "a Navy official familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly about it said that the captain had repeatedly asked his superiors for speedy action to evacuate the ship."

Kathleen H. Hicks, who worked at the Pentagon years earlier under President Barack Obama, said that the Navy did have the legal right to fire Crozier but that it might have been a bad idea to do so because it might make sailors and leaders less willing to trust each other.

Royal Thai General System of Transcription

The Royal Thai General System of Transcription (RTGS) is the official system used to write Thai words into the Latin alphabet, or romanization. Thai has certain vowel and consonant sounds and other phonemic features that do not exist in English. This means that saying a syllable with a different tone or vowel length can make a completely different word. For these reasons, romanization in Thai presented many challenges. The RTGS only uses the 26 letters in the ISO standard Latin alphabet to spell Thai words. It is used on all documents that require words to be written in the Latin alphabet, including road signs, maps, applications, etc. However, it has many problems. The system does not show tones or vowel length, both of which are phonemic features of Thai. It also does not tell some of the consonant sounds apart.

SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One

"SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One" is the eleventh episode of the sixth season of "SpongeBob SquarePants". It was first shown on television on April 17, 2009. 5.8 million people watched the episode on television when it was first shown. In the episode, SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Sandy are pulled away by a giant wave. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward get stuck on an island. They look for a surf guru named Jack Kahuna Laguna who can teach them how to get past a wave that is hard to find, called The Big One, so that they can get back to Bikini Bottom. On March 3, 2009, both a DVD and a video game based on the episode were released. 

Mr. Krabs sees people going to Goo Lagoon, a beach, so he goes there to sell Krabby Patties. SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs get on a surfboard and find Patrick and Sandy. Patrick tries to get on the surfboard, but he causes it to fall and it gets into a giant wave that separates everyone. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward end up on an island with other surfers. Mr. Krabs is all alone in the middle of the ocean with his cash register, Cashy. Sandy gets put on a different island and builds a helicopter.

The surfers tell SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward that the only way to get back to Bikini Bottom is to surf there, but they do not know how to. One of the surfers, named Twitch, tells them that the only person who can teach them is a surfer named Jack Kahuna Laguna. Once the three find Jack Kahuna Laguna, he comes out a hut with a long surfboard and says that they have to ride a big wave called The Big One to get back home. They practice surfing to get ready for The Big One. Before they start surfing on The Big One, Jack Kahuna Laguna says that it wants a sacrifice.

SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward surf The Big One and find Mr. Krabs and Cashy. Mr. Krabs gets on the board but drops Cashy. Jack Kahuna Laguna goes and gets Cashy and acts as the sacrifice. Once the wave disappears, SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs are near Goo Lagoon. Sandy's helicopter crashes into Goo Lagoon as well. The people in Goo Lagoon throw a party for them coming back. 

Carey Bryson of About.com said that "parents will also be pleased, as the episode contains no rude words or inappropriate jokes." Maddy Pumilia for Blogcrotics reviewed the episode and wrote "Like most SpongeBob episodes, this episode was comic genius. I especially enjoyed Mr. Krabs' love affair with his cash register, Cashy. It's hilarious. Best part of the show, in my opinion." Ian Jane of DVD Talk said "[the episode] is absolutely worth a watch thanks to the series high standard of quality, quirky animation, and multilayered humor." David Hinckly of the "New York Daily News" gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars and said "It's all good when you never forget to have fun."

"" is a video game that is based on the episode. It was released on March 3, 2009 for the Nintendo DS and was published by THQ. "Surf's Up, SpongeBob!" is a book that is based on the episode. It was written by David Lewman in 2009 and was published by Simon Spotlight and Nickelodeon.

Screenless

"Screenless" is the fifteenth episode of the thirty-first season of "The Simpsons". It was first shown on television on the Fox network on March 8, 2020. In the episode, Marge wants the family to lower their screen time. However, she later finds out she needs to lower her screen time the most. The episode was dedicated to James Lipton who died on March 2, 2020, six days before the episode was shown on television. He guest starred in the episodes "The Sweetest Apu" and "Homer the Father".

The Simpsons family is watching a murder show on TV. Lisa sees Maggie trying to get their attention so she changes the channel to a show that teaches babies sign language. Maggie was trying to tell them that Hans Moleman is stuck under a tree that fell, but the family does not notice. In the morning, they keep watching the show and Hans is taken to an ambulance.

The show is cancelled because the government stopped funding the show, so Marge tries teaching Maggie sign language herself. Marge tries to tell the family about Maggie's development, but the family is too busy on their devices. Marge decides to limit everyone's screen time to half an hour a week. 

Marge catches Homer, Bart, and Lisa having their screen time changed by a technician, so she puts away the devices completely. Homer is bored at work, so he starts playing word puzzles in a newspaper. Marge sees how strong devices are affecting Patty and Selma. Bart uses his imagination at school when he gets a toy rocket down from the school roof. Lisa gets the feeling of joy when she finds books from the library without using devices.

Marge can not find the recipe she is looking for, so when the family comes back home, they find her in the closet with her phone and laptop. Marge admits that she is the one who is addicted to devices. She signs the family up for a month at the Screen Addiction Rehab Center, a place to treat screen addictions.

The next day, they get in to the center and find out it is a pleasant place. The owner, Dr. Lund, shows them around the place and what you can do. The family starts to recover, but they can not hold back for long. They find the workers all using computers and sending spam mail after stealing the patients' accounts. The family can not leave because they signed a non-disclosure contract which does not let them leave the center.

At night, the family uses sign language to communicate with each other and escape the center. The next day, Dr. Lund is arrested for scamming.

Dennis Perkins of "The A.V. Club" gave the episode a score of B- and says that "there's not enough else to recommend 'Screenless,' as the Simpsons’ individual journeys through the hell of online withdrawal are short-changed and unsatisfying." "Den of Geek" gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars and says that the episode "is a sweet episode because it promises that families can be in the same room as each other and still be together."

In this spiritual journey, he read many western philosophical classics.

Broadly Applicable Tracking System

The Broadly Applicable Tracking System, also called BATS, is a very small, lightweight tool shaped like a backpack. Scientists glue the BATS onto the back of a bat or other small animal and then use GPS and wireless internet to see where the animal goes.

The scientists who invented BATS say it is different from other systems because it is lighter, uses less power and can track animals even inside caves or hollow trees.

BATS can be made with a 3D printer, and it is so light that it does not slow down small bats when they fly. It also falls off after about fourteen days. Scientists can collect fallen BATS to reuse the parts.

Scientists used BATS to show that vampire bats can make social bonds when being kept by humans that they remember after being released.

Scientists named the tool "broadly applicable tracking system" because they believe it can be used in a broad range of animals: bats, rodents, amphibians and reptiles. "Broadly applicable" means "can be used in many ways." As of April 2020, BATS has only been used on bats.

The team that invented BATS includes scientists from the Museum of Natural History in Berlin and universities in Germany and Ohio State University.

Martin and Lyon met in 1950, became lovers in 1952, and moved in together on Valentine's Day 1953. They had been together for three years when they co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in San Francisco in 1955. It was the first social and political organization for lesbians in the United States.

They both acted as president and editor of "The Ladder" until 1963, and remained involved in the DOB until joining the National Organization for Women (NOW) as the first lesbian couple to do so.

They were married on February 12, 2004, in the first same-sex wedding to take place in San Francisco after Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered the city clerk to begin providing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. However, that marriage was voided by the California Supreme Court on August 12, 2004.

The DOB educated them about their rights, and about gay history.

The Daughters of Bilitis lasted for 14 years, becoming an educational resource for lesbians, gay men, researchers and mental health professionals.

The Ladder (magazine)

The Ladder was the first nationally distributed lesbian publication in the United States. It was published monthly from 1956 to 1970, and once every other month in 1971 and 1972.

Orthodox Presbyterian Church

The Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC) is a Presbyterian denomination in the northern United States. It was made by members of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA). They strongly objected to the Modernist theology during the 1930s. It had influence on evangelicalism far beyond its size.

The Orthodox Presbyterian Church was made in 1936. It was founded largely through the efforts of John Gresham Machen. Machen and others had founded Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929, in response to a re-organization of Princeton Theological Seminary. In 1933, Machen, concerned about Liberal Christianity|liberal theology tolerated by Presbyterians on the mission field, formed the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions. The next Presbyterian General Assembly reaffirmed that Independent Board was unconstitutional and gave the associated clergy an ultimatum to break their links. When Machen and seven other clergy refused, they were suspended from the Presbyterian ministry.

On June 11, 1936, Machen and a group of conservative ministers, elders, and laymen met in Philadelphia to form the Presbyterian Church of America (not to be confused with the Presbyterian Church in America, or PCA, which came about decades later). Machen was elected as the first moderator. The PCUSA filed suit against the denomination for its choice of name. In 1939, the denomination adopted its current name, the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.
Machen died in January 1937. Later that year, a significant faction of the OPC, led by Carl McIntire, broke away to form the Bible Presbyterian Church, a denomination which, unlike the OPC, required abstinence from alcohol and taught premillennialism.

As of 2014, The OPC had 281 congregations. In 2019, Escondido Orthodox Presbyterian Church received media attention as the church of which John Earnest, alleged perpetrator of the 2019 Poway synagogue shooting|Poway synagogue shooting, was a member. Its pastor, Zake Keele, condemned the shooting as an "act of evil."

The OPC system of doctrine is the Reformed faith. This is also called Calvinism. 
Calvin's doctrines continued to develop after his death, and an evolution of them was set forth by a 17th-century assembly of British theologians in the Westminster Standards (which include the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Westminster Larger Catechism|Larger and Westminster Shorter Catechism|Shorter Catechisms). The OPC holds to the Westminster Standards with the American revisions of 1788.
The OPC provides the following summary of its doctrine:


OPC pastors and presbyteries teach a range of doctrines based on the historical view of the biblical creation accounts, from framework and analogical interpretations to young earth.

The 39th General Assembly, meeting in 1972, adopted a statement on abortion that said "voluntary abortion, except possibly to save the physical life of the mother, is in violation of the Sixth Commandment (Exodus 20:13)."
In 1993, the denomination petitioned then President Bill Clinton to continue to disallow homosexuals to serve in the military. According to the petition, "homosexuality is a reproach to any nation. It undermines the family, and poses a substantial threat to the general health, safety and welfare of our citizens." The petition claims that AIDS and "other diseases" are spread through homosexual conduct.
The 68th General Assembly declared that women serving in combat positions in the military is contrary to the Bible.

In 2006-2007, a study committee formed by the General Assembly created a report that said "the church should never turn its back on fellow brothers and sisters in Christ, whether they are legally or illegally in the country. We should be willing to see to the spiritual and physical needs of anyone who comes to the church." The report also recommended that illegal immigrants seek to "repent" of their legal status.

OPC ministers have held a variety of political views. Carl Trueman, an ordained minister in the OPC, has authored "Republocrat: Confessions of a Liberal Conservative" (pub. 2010). Several founders of American Christian Reconstructionism (such as Rousas John Rushdoony and Greg Bahnsen) were Orthodox Presbyterian ministers.



Orthodox Presbyterian Church of Korea

The Orthodox Presbyterian Church of Korea (OPCK, Founder Ha Seung Moo) is a historic Orthodox Reformed Church's doctrine and historical succession of tradition of the John Knox's <Scottish Presbyterian Church> declared the first among Presbyterian denomination in Korea. Launched in January 2012.

Most objections to and attacks on Calvinism focus on the "five points of Calvinism," also called the doctrines of grace, and remembered by the mnemonic "TULIP." The five points are popularly said to summarize the Canons of Dort; however, there is no historical relationship between them, and some scholars argue that their language distorts the meaning of the Canons, Calvin's theology, and the theology of 17th-century Calvinistic orthodoxy, particularly in the language of total depravity and limited atonement. The five points were popularized in the 1963 booklet "The Five Points of Calvinism Defined, Defended, Documented" by David N. Steele and Curtis C. Thomas. The origins of the five points and the acronym are uncertain, but the acronym was used by Cleland Boyd McAfee as early as circa 1905. An early printed appearance of the T-U-L-I-P acronym is in Loraine Boettner's 1932 book, "The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination". The acronym was very cautiously if ever used by Calvinist apologists and theologians before the booklet by Steele and Thomas. More recently, theologians have sought to reformulate the TULIP acronym to more accurately reflect the Canons of Dort.
The central assertion of these points is that God saves every person upon whom he has mercy, and that his efforts are not frustrated by the unrighteousness or inability of humans.

The OPCK system of doctrine is the Reformed faith, also called Calvinism. Since the establishment of the Presbyterian Church and Calvin's doctrines continued to develop after his death, and a particular evolution of them was set forth by a 17th-century assembly of British theologians in the Westminster Standards (which include the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Westminster Larger Catechism|Larger and Westminster Shorter Catechism|Shorter Catechisms). The OPC holds to the Westminster Standards with the American revisions of 1788.

History of Sri Lanka

Most Sinhalese in the island claim that Sri Lanka was ruled by nagas and yakkas before Vijaya( a prince from India ) came to Sri Lanka. The most famous of these legendary kings is Ravana. Most people in the country believe that Ravana is still alive but in deep sleep. But most prominent historians regard Vijaya as Sri lanka's first king. Vijaya is an Indian prince who because of misbehavior was put in a boat with his 700 friends was sent off. He was the son of king Sinhabahu who was in fact the son of a Lion. Hence most Sinhalse claim to be descending from the Lion's blood.

There were several kings who ruled Sri Lanka after Vijaya but the most important after that was Pandukabaya because he chose Anuradhapura as the country's capital.

The first Portuguese arrived at Sri Lanka in 1505.

Sri Lanka experienced the Civil war through years 1983 to 2009. Racial discrimination after the post colonial era was the main reason for civil war as such. The sinhala only act which was passed in 1953 was one of the main reasons for a war as such. This act led to about 1/3 of the population facing difficulties when performing daily tasks. It also gave superior status to the Sinhalese component of the population.

Even though most people criticize the Act, it can be argued as a healthy decision as previously Lanka used colonial English to handle work at courts which limited amout of people understood. So it was really a choice between making more people understand or making the population literate in English.

The war was between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan army. Due to careful planning and expert battling techniques of Sarath Fonseka under the guidance of former president Mahinda Rajapakse and former defence secreatariat Gotabaya Rajapakse, the brutal civil war ended in May 2009 as the LTTE admitted defeat.

Sri Lanka had to gain international confidence after the war.

LGBT rights in India

Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in India may face difficulties from the law and the society. Non-LGBT persons do not commonly face these difficulties. India has removed laws that treated gay sex and transgender people unfairly. But, Indian laws do not completely protect from unfair treatment or allow same-sex marriage.

Since 2014, transgender people in India may change their gender without surgery. The constitution also gives them a right to name themselves under a third gender. Some states also protect "hijras", who are traditional third gender people in South Asia, through housing programmes, welfare benefits, pension schemes, and free operations in government hospitals. There are about 4.8 million transgender people in India.

In 2018, the Supreme Court of India said that homosexuality was not a crime. It declared that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code did not follow the constitution when adults had consensual homosexual sex. Homosexuality was never illegal in ancient Indian and traditional codes. It was made a crime by the British during their rule in India.

Though LGBT rights have been spoken for in recent political movements, much homophobia is still present among the people. A poll from 2019 says that around half of Indians object to same-sex relationships. Hindu respondents accept the LGBT community the highest. In 2010s, LGBT people in India gained tolerance and acceptance, especially in large cities. Still, most LGBT people in India remain hidden because they fear unfair treatment from their families who might see homosexuality as shameful.

Marriages between people of the same sex are not allowed in India by law. Same-sex couples are also not given rights of civil union or a household partnership. In 2011, a Haryana court marked a same-sex marriage involving two women as lawful. After marrying, the couple got threats from friends and relatives in their village. Their family finally accepted their marriage.

In October 2017, a group of citizens advised that a new Uniform Civil Code be created. This code would make the same-sex marriage lawful before the Law Commission of India.

There are now many same-sex marriage applications still waiting to be judged by the courts.

Article 15 of the Indian Constitution protects Indian citizens from unfair treatment

The Supreme Court of India has ruled that unfair treatment because of sexual orientation and gender identity did not follow the Constitution. 

Even after this, no clear law bans unfair treatment based on both sexual orientation and gender identity. India does not have detailed laws which protect against most unfair treatment and harassment in private jobs. (Such laws exist for sexual harassment though.) Article 15 only covers unfair treatment by government bodies.

In 2019, the "Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2019" was accepted. The law bans unfair treatment against transgender people in private jobs, education and healthcare.

LGBT activists are reaching out to people who have faced unfair treatment (because of their sexual orientation or gender identity) in private jobs or other non-governmental areas. They are asking such people to question the two rulings in court. They are also fighting for a clear law against unfair treatment. Such a law would also cover private unfair treatment.

LGBT people are banned from working in the Indian military. In December 2018, Member of Parliament Jagdambika Pal (BJP) asked the Indian Parliament to change the "Army Act, 1950", the "Navy Act, 1957" and the "Air Force Act, 1950". His advised change would allow LGBT people to work in the military.

Actor Kamal Rashid Khan was booked by the police on December 9, 2018 for making rude comments against LGBT people.

In February 2014, the Indian Psychiatric Society (IPS) said that homosexuality is not unnatural. It also said that neither science nor rules for psychiatry could prove that homosexuality is a mental illness or a disease. 

In June 2018, the IPS repeated its stand on the issue. It said that we should not disapprove of people who are not heterosexual, punish them, or remove them from the society.

Even after this, conversion treatments still happen in India. They usually carry out electroshock treatment (which may cause memory loss), hypnosis, drugs causing nausea, or talk therapy. In talk therapy, the person is told that homosexuality happens because they are "not asserting enough" or have "an uncaring father and a strict mother". Conversion treatments can cause depression, anxiety, seizures, drug use and suicidal tendencies.

In July 2019, lawmaker K. T. S. Tulsi introduced the "Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2018" in the Rajya Sabha to amend the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code and the "Indian Evidence Act, 1872" in order to make sexual crimes gender-neutral by including men and transgender people in addition to women. If passed the bill allows for recognition of not only transgender persons defined as the "other" gender under Indian law, but would potentially leave the door open for the recognition of other gender identities.

Problems of intersex people in India are seen as problems of third gender people. The most well-known third gender groups in India are the "hijras". After talking to "hijras" for many years, Serena Nanda wrote a book called "Neither Man Nor Woman: The hijras of India". In the book, she wrote that people in India believed that hijras were born as intersex persons and were taken away by the hijra community at birth or in childhood. However, she found no proof for this belief among the hijras whom she met. They had all joined the group on their own whenthey were teenagers. Sangam literature uses the word "pedi" for people who are born intersex. Other groups in India call intersex people as "mabedi usili" and give them special names.

Intersex persons are not protected from attacks on to their bodies.

Cases where small intersex children have been killed have been reported. Medical reports say that parents in India usually think of small intersex children to be male. Parents choose to have surgery done on children if they can pay for it.

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, India, answered a letter from an activist for intersex rights, Gopi Shankar Madurai. In the answer, they wrote that any surgery, even operations to change sex, are done only after testing the patient completely, designing a proper treatment asking the patient/guardian".

Indian passports are available with an "O" option (for "Other") to name one's sex, apart from Male and Female options.

On 22 April 2019, the Madras High Court made an important judgement. The judgement said that transgender women were allowed to marry. The judgement ordered the state of Tamil Nadu to ban surgeries on small intersex children based on their sex. The court looked at the works of intersex activist Gopi Shankar. The Court found out that compulsory treatments were often done on intersex children. The court also gave examples from Hindu mythology in its judgement, like the story of Iravan.

Many Indian sports-persons have been shamed and treated unfairly after their sex was checked. They have also lost work and their medals. Santhi Soundarajan was a runner who won the silver medal in the 800 metres race at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar. Her medal was taken away from her and she tried to kill herself later. Another runner, Pinki Pramanik, was blamed by a female roommate of rape. She was later tested and named male, though she and other medical experts do not agree. Yet another Indian runner, Dutee Chand, won a case against the IAAF in 2015. This case helped women runners with more testosterone in their bodies to participate as women because there is no clear proof that testosterone benefits performance. In 2016, some sports doctors said that runners born with a problem of sex development who were raised as females should be allowed to participate as women.

Gopi Shankar Madurai was one of the youngest candidate to run in an Indian election. He was also the first openly intersex and genderqueer candidate. He ran for a seat in the 2016 Tamil Nadu elections.

What people think about LGBT rights in India is difficult to answer. According to a 2016 poll by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, 35% of Indian people wanted to make same-sex marriage legal. 35% id not want same-sex marriage to be legal. A survey by the Varkey Foundation found that 18-21 year olds supported same-sex marriage more than others.

According to a 2017 poll carried out by ILGA, 58% of Indians agreed that gay, lesbian and bisexual people should have the same rights as straight people. 30% Indians disagreed. Additionally, 59% agreed that they should be protected from unfair treatment at the workplace. But 39% of Indians said that people who are in same-sex relationships should be considered criminals (44% people disagreed with this). 66% people agreed that transgender people should have the same rights as others, 62% believed they should be protected from unfair treatment at work and 60% believed they should be allowed to change their gender before law.

Top government institutes, such as IITs, accept LGBT people more. According to a poll conducted at IIT Delhi in 2015, 72% of respondents agreed that "being homosexual is normal as being heterosexual". Many IITs have their own LGBT clubs, like "Saathi" (English: Friend) at IIT Bombay, "" at IIT Delhi, "Ambar" at IIT Kharagpur, "Unmukt" at IIT Kanpur and more.

According to a 2019 survey, the Indian states/union territories which accepted the LGBT community most were Uttar Pradesh (36%), followed by Tamil Nadu (30%) and Delhi (30%). The states which showed accepted same-sex relationships least were Mizoram (87%), followed by Nagaland (63%), Jammu and Kashmir (63%) and Kerala (58%). The states with the most undecided respondents were West Bengal (60%), followed by Assam (40%), Punjab (39%) and Tripura (37%). The Hindu community accepted same-sex relationships the most. Christian respondents opposed same sex-relationships most(70%), followed by Muslims (50%) and both Hindus and Sikhs at 40%.

Local extinction

Local extinction, or extirpation, is when a species or other taxon becomes extinct in a certain area. This is different from being extinct across the world (global extinction) because these species still exist outside of that area. Sometimes when this happens, it can have a very large effect on how the ecosystem works. This might be because that species was important in the food web. The species disappearing might cause more species to go locally extinct or the balance of biomass to change.

There have been many cases when species have been added back, or reintroduced, to that area after going locally extinct. If a species is reintroduced after a long amount of time, this might mean there will be larger effects on the ecology of that area. An example of a species being reintroduced are grey wolves in Yellowstone National Park.

Singha

Singha (; ) is a beer brand. It is manufactured in Thailand by the Singha Corporation Co. Ltd.. Singha corp is a subsidiary of its parent company, Boon Rawd Brewery.

Praya Bhirom Bhakdi received a license to brew beer from the Thai government. In May 1933, construction of a brewery began. Boon Rawd Brewery was founded on 4 August 1933. In March 1934, production was started. Three beers were brewed: Golden Kite, Singha, and Stupa.

A royal warrant was bestowed on 25 October 1939. Boon Rawd is the only brewery permitted to display the royal Garuda. The Singha is a powerful mythological lion, found in ancient South Asian and Thai mythology.

Boon Rawd bought two German breweries at Hartmannsdorf and Mittweida, Saxony in 1994. Some Singha beer is brewed in Germany by Schlossbrauerei Au-Hallertau under licence from Singha Corporation Co., Ltd..

Beginning in September 2007, a 5.0% (abv) version of Singha replaced the 6.0% (abv) original. This new version, while still brewed in Thailand by Pathum Thani Brewery Co. Ltd., states on its label to have been brewed under the supervision of Singha Corporation Co. Ltd., instead of Boon Rawd.

From 2013, some Singha beer has reportedly been produced at Carlsberg's Russian plant for distribution in some markets. Singha is also said to use eight Carlsberg plants in Asia for production, as part of an agreement to share each other's production facilities and markets.

Muhiuddin Khan

Maulana Muhiuddin Khan (; April 19, 1935, Pakundia – June 25, 2016, Kishoreganj), known also as Muhiuddin Khan of the Quran, was a Bangladeshi Muslim politician, scholar and author who wrote numerous books on Islam in Bengali and also noted for the famous Bengali translation of the Quran through the Maariful Quran. He was major in Bengali, Urdu, Persian and Arabic.

He translated for the first time tafseer Maariful Quran into Bengali.

Zohurul Hoque

Zohurul Hoque (Bengali: জহুুুুুুুুুুুুরুুল হক; Assamese: জহৰুুুুুুুুুুুুুুুুল হক; October 11, 1926 - January 18, 2017), was an Indian Muslim figure from Assam who is the only figure noted for the translation of the Quran in three languages, which were Bengali, Assamese and English. Along with the translation by Muhiuddin Khan, his Bengali translation of the Quran is one of the most used, but it is not famous in terms of built-up structure of the translation of the certain verses in the Quran, unlike Muhiuddin Khan who did.

Trial in absentia

Trial in absentia (literally "in absence" in the Latin language) means a person is held responsible for a crime and tried although he or she is not present during the proceedings. It may be because the person is at an unknown location or has escaped justice, for example after paying bail and then refused to return to the court on the date set anyway, or because the person may not be even alive (a famous case is Martin Bormann, who most likely died in May 1945 and was sentenced to death in November 1946, as part of the Nuremberg Trials). It is controversial, especially if a person is convicted and sentenced to a hard punishment, because the basic premise of a trial is thus violated, and everyone has a right to defend oneself. Others point out, however, that this right is waived when one doesn't show up without a good reason and that the court must make its best, through appointing a defender for instance, to determine guilt or innocence even if the person is not present. Most defendants make their case through a defender anyway, especially when the crime is serious. 

Another case is when a court or committee must determine whether a person, such as a suspected terrorist, is going to be surveilled or wire-tapped, and whether there is enough suspicion of criminal activity or intent to do so. In that case, the person himself can of course not be asked to appear, as the idea is to hold the surveillance secret. In that case, a defender is appointed to make the case that the suspected person does not want to and does not deserve to be subjected to surveillance and that it should not be permitted, although he/she doesn't know of the proceedings. Most of such hearings, however, are not a trial in the technical sense of the term, though they may involve a judge and lawyer and so on.

Letter bomb

A letter bomb is a bomb concealed within a letter or package, which is then sent or left for the recipient to find, typically with his or her name and address on, to be opened and then exploded, or exploded within a certain time.

The first known case of a "modern" letter bomb was the Swedish bombmaker Martin Ekenberg in August 1904. He built a bomb and sent it to a factory owner in Stockholm called Karl Fredrik Lundin. The bomb exploded but nobody was seriously injured. He sent a total of four bombs until 1907 before he was discovered.

There had been many injuries caused by letter bombs. A very famous letter bombmaker is Ted Kaczynski, the so-called "Unabomber", who sent a series of letter bombs between 1978 and 1995, killing three people (all men) and injuring 23. One package, however, exploded onboard an airplane, which could have killed all the passengers and personnel, but it only caused an emergency landing. He stopped sending bombs after the New York Times accepted to publish a text he had written called "Industrial Society and its Future".

Unfortunately for him, his brother recognised the writing style and alerted the police, which ultimately captured Kaczynski and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The bombs were very well made and had no evidence from the sender, but typically of letter bombs, they are too small to case significant damage, and in most cases did not even kill the person who opened the package (this was also the case with Ekenberg, who failed to kill a single person). For this reason, and because most important government departments X-rays packages, the method is not very efficient.

Another

Several government agencies have used letter bombs to target persons outside their jurisdiction. One victim of a letter bomb was German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who was sent a letter bomb by the so-called Stern gang and Israeli politician (and later Prime Minister) Menachem Begin in the 1950s.

Begin's reasons, as he explained, was that Adenauer and all Germans were responsible for the deaths of millions of Jews during the Holocaust, although Adenauer had been imprisoned by the Nazi regime which committed these crimes. The same group also sent several bombs to US President Harry S. Truman. The South African apartheid regime used letter bombs, including to activist Ruth First, who died when opening one in 1982.

Drancy internment camp

Drancy internment camp was a concentration camp in France during its occupation by Nazi Germany during World War II. It was organised in 1941 to collect French Jews and particularly foreign Jews who had escaped to France before the invasion by the Germans. After that, they were put on railroad carts and sent east, to concentration camps, from which most did not return alive. Nearly 70,000 people were rounded up, including resistance fighters, Roma people, and others considered "undesirable". Until 1943, the camp was administered by French police under German supervision. After this, the French were removed and replaced by German SS men led by Alois Brunner, which increased the efficiency of the deportations. 

When the camp was liberated in 1944, about 1,500 people remained. Brunner was later tried (in absence) and sentenced to death, but remained at large until his death in 2010.

History of the Jews in Europe

Jews have lived in Europe for thousands of years, and their dispersal and relations with governing authorities and peoples have changed greatly. In the Roman Republic and Roman Empire, there was a Jewish minority which had varying rights and relations with the Romans. After the Roman-Jewish wars in the first and second centuries and the destruction of the Temple, Jews were expelled from Palestine, which greatly increased their numbers in Europe (and North Africa and Asia). In the Middle Ages, with the spread of Christianity and Christian anti-Semitism, conditions were generally bad. Jews were often separated from Christians. They were not allowed in some jobs . They were made to live in particular parts of cities, called ghettos. They were allowed to do certain jobs that Christians were not allowed to, such as lending money to people for interest, which was considered bad for Christians. This made some Jews wealthy but also increased persecutions. 

Jews were eventually welcomed in Poland, whose king declared the Statute of Kalisz to protect them. Ashkenazi Jews lived in Eastern Europe. Sephardi Jews lived In Spain and Portugal. Under Muslim rule, the so-called Al Andalus period, Jews were generally accepted although they could not take part in the government. After Christian rule was re-established on the Iberian peninsula, Jews were rejected and persecuted if they stayed. Some sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire, which was then relatively tolerant to Jews and Christians and allowed them to have their own courts and laws, as long as they payed taxes and did not resist Ottoman rule. 

After the Renaissance and the Early Modern Period, Jews were integrated increasingly and permitted to live openly as Jews in more and more countries. After the French Revolution, France and other European countries affected by French rule through Napoleon I introduced secular laws aimed at abolishing religion in the public sphere and treating Jews more openly as citizens. Jews began to discard their religion by becoming Christians, like British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli's father, Isaac d'Israeli. Many European countries had restrictions on Jews until the 19th and 20th centuries such as banning them from certain professions or holding public offices. Many Jews became prominent scientists or public intellectuals such as Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein. 
Some emigrated to the United States and other American countries, including Argentina, which to this day has a large Jewish community. Eventually, the United States gathered the largest Jewish population outside of the Russian Empire. After Poland became an independent country again after the Treaty of Versailles, it had the largest Jewish population in Europe, with about 3,000,000 Jews. The Soviet Union, which came about in 1922, had nearly as many. With Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, there was again increased emigration, to the Western European countries and to the United States, supported by the Germans who did not want Jews in German-governed territory. More Jews emigrated to Palestine, which had been taken from the Ottoman Turks by the United Kingdom in 1917, to establish a Jewish homeland for Jews. Hitler temporarily supported this migration, but the British were sceptic, as the greater number of Jews meant conflicts with the local Arabs, who resisted Jewish immigration, and several bloody rebellions were fought between them and the British troops in the region. With World War II, the Nazi-controlled German armies occupied most of Europe and started to deport Jews east, eventually adopting a policy of mass murder known as the Holocaust. After 1942, all Jews under German control (with very few exceptions) would be sent to Eastern Europe and killed or worked to death. In the end, before Nazi Germany's defeat in 1945, this killed about two thirds of the Jewish population in Europe. Only the Jewish communities of Albania, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Britain and Ireland were untouched, and those of Italy, Yugoslavia and Romania much less affected. Many remaining Jews migrated to the United States and Palestine, where Israel was created in 1948 as a Jewish-majority state, which resulted in Europe losing most of its Jewish population and the United States becoming the most Jewish country. Later persecution in Communist Poland and other countries led to more refugees. In Poland less than 3,000 remain today. In France, the United Kingdom and Russia, however, there are significant communities left comparable to before the war.

Cloth facemask

A cloth facemask is a face covering which is used to cover the mouth and nose. As the name suggests, these masks are made of textiles. Cotton is commonly used. Starting with the 19th century, such masks have been used by healthcare professionals. They are also used to protect against air pollution, although they may not be very effective in protecting against air pollution. 

Depending on the design, they can be effective stopping the transmission of disease spread by droplets of liquid. Today, healthcare professionals often use surgical masks or respirators, which offer better protection. A study done in 2010 found that 40 to 90 percent of particles pass through a cloth facemask.

Cloth face masks are commonly used during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when surgical and other medical face coverings are not available.

George Bass

George Bass (30 January 1771 – after 5 February 1803) was a British naval surgeon and explorer of Australia.

Bass was born on 30 January 1771 at Aswarby, near Sleaford, Lincolnshire. His father, George, was a tenant farmer, George Bass, and his mother a local beauty named Sarah (née Newman). His father died in 1777. He went to Boston Grammar School and later studied medicine at the hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire. At the age of 18, he was accepted in London as a member of the Company of Surgeons, and in 1794 he joined the Royal Navy as a surgeon.

He arrived in Sydney in New South Wales on HMS "Reliance" on 7 September 1795.

Also on the voyage were Matthew Flinders, John Hunter, Bennelong, and his surgeon's assistant William Martin.

Bass brought a small boat to Australia. It had an keel and beam, which he called the Tom Thumb on account of its size. In October 1795 Bass and Flinders, accompanied by William Martin sailed to Botany Bay and explored the Georges River. Their reports on their return led to the settlement of Banks' Town.

In March 1796 they went on a second voyage in a larger small boat, which they called the Tom Thumb II. They travelled down the coast to Lake Illawarra, which they called Tom Thumb Lagoon. They explored Port Hacking.

Later in 1796 Bass discovered good farming land near Prospect Hill, found cattle which had been lost since 1788, and tried to cross the Blue Mountains.

In 1797 Bass and six crew sailed an open whaleboat to Cape Howe, the farthest point of south-eastern Australia. From here they kept going went west as far as Western Port. He believed that Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) was not joined to mainland Australia. Watching the tides and the long south-western swell at Wilson's Promontory convinced him that his idea was right.

Bass visited the Kiama area on the south coast of New South Wales. He made notes on the many plants and the amazing natural phenomenon, the Kiama Blowhole.

In 1798, Bass and Flinders, sailed the "Norfolk", around Van Diemen's Land, proving that it was an island. They visited the estuary of the Derwent River, found and named by Captain John Hayes in 1793. Bass made a report which led to it being chosen for the future city of Hobart in 1803. When they got back to Sydney, Flinders recommended to Governor John Hunter that the passage between Van Diemen's Land and the mainland be called Bass Strait.

"This was no more than a just tribute to my worthy friend and companion," Flinders wrote, "for the extreme dangers and fatigues he had undergone, in first entering it in a whaleboat, and to the correct judgement he had formed, from various indications, of the existence of a wide opening between Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales."

Bass sent some of his botanical discoveries to Sir Joseph Banks in London. "In this voyage of fourteen weeks I collected those few plants upon Van Diemen's Land which had not been familiar to me in New South Wales," he wrote to Banks, "and have done myself the honour of submitting them to your inspection." He was made an honorary member of the Society for Promoting Natural History, which later became the Linnean Society. Some of his reports were published in the second volume of David Collins's "An Account of the English colony in New South Wales." He was one of the first to describe the Australian marsupial, the wombat.

On 8 October 1800, George married Elizabeth Waterhouse at St James's Church, Westminster. She was the sister of Henry Waterhouse, Bass's former shipmate, and captain of the "Reliance". In January 1801 Bass set sail again for Australia, leaving Elizabeth behind. The couple wrote to each other, they did not meet again, as Bass never returned from this journey.

Bass and a group of friends had invested some £10,000 in the copper-sheathed brig , and a cargo of general goods to sell in Port Jackson.

On the voyage, the ship passed through Bass Strait. He recorded it simply as Bass Strait, like any other geographical feature. His modesty meant he felt no need to say "discovered by me" or "named after me".

On arrival Bass that others had brought out goods as well, and he was unable to sell his cargo. Governor King was trying to save money and would buy the cargo, even at a 50% discount. King did ask Bass to get salt pork from Tahiti. Food was scarce in Sydney at that time and prices were high, yet there were plenty of pigs in the Society Islands. King said he would pay Bass six pence a pound, half the current price in Sydney. This deal suited both men. With his partner Charles Bishop, Bass sailed from Sydney in the "Venus" for Dusky Sound in New Zealand. They spent 14 days taking iron from the wreck of Captain Brampton's old ship the "Endeavour". This was made into axes which were used to trade for the pork in Tahiti. They returned to Sydney in November 1802.

In January 1803 Bass asked King for the rights to all the fish along the South Island of New Zealand, from Dusky Sound to Otago Harbour – now the site of the city of Dunedin. He also wanted to include all the lands and seas to the south, notably the Antipodes Islands. His brother-in-law, Waterhouse, had discovered the islands, and probably told him about the excellent prospects for fishing.

Bass set sail on his last voyage in the "Venus" on 5 February 1803, but he and his crew were never seen again. His plan was to go to Tahiti and perhaps on to the Spanish colonies on the coast of Chile to buy provisions and bring them back to Sydney.

Bass may also have planned to smuggle goods into Chile. Spain would only allow Spanish ships and merchants to bring goods into the country. But the colonists in Chile needed more than they could supply and shortages and heavy taxation caused high prices. This made smuggling profitable. Port Jackson was described by some 19th-century historians as a base for such smuggling Britain's strained relationship with Spain at that time meant British authorities were unconcerned.

Bass still had much of the general cargo he had brought to Sydney in 1801 and he may well have been tempted to try and sell it in Chile. Two of his last letters have hints at a venture which he could not name. He set off in 1803, with a diplomatic letter from Governor King attesting his bona-fides and that his sole purpose if he were on the West coast of South America would be in procuring provisions.

He was never heard from again, and Governor King and Bass's friends in Sydney were forced to accept that he had met some misfortune. In England in January 1806 Bass was listed by the Admiralty as lost at sea. His wife Elizabeth was given money from the widows' fund, back dated to when Bass's half-pay had ended in June 1803. Bass had made the usual contributions to the fund from his salary.

There are many ideas about what may have happened to Bass. One story, by William Campbell of the brig "Harrington", said that Bass was captured by the Spanish in Chile and sent to the silver mines. The "Harrington" was also involved in smuggling and returned to Sydney some three months after Bass's departure. But this story dates from 1811 in a report by William Fitzmaurice. Campbell did not mention Bass in either 1803, or in 1805 when he captured a Spanish ship. Three months is too short for Bass to have reached Chile and then the "Harrington" to get back to Sydney.

Also all British prisoners held by the Spanish in Chile and Peru were freed in 1808 and returned to Europe. If the crew of the "Venus" had been captured then none of the 25 survived.

Adventurer Jorgen Jorgenson wrote about Bass in 1835. He said Bass had attempted forced trade at gunpoint in Chile, and was captured when he let his guard down. Jorgenson probably met Bass, but this story is almost certainly not true. Jorgenson's writing, though entertaining, was often far from factual.

A search of Spanish archives in 1903 by scholar Pascual de Gayangos and a search of Peruvian archives in 2003 by historian Jorge Ortiz-Sotelo found no mention of Bass. His ultimate fate remains a mystery.

In 1963 Bass was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post, and again in 1998 with Matthew Flinders.

A re-enactment of the whaleboat voyage was made on the 200th anniversary of Bass's voyage. It arrived at Western Port on 5 January 1998, using a "Elizabeth" skippered by Bern Cuthbertson.

The following places were named after Bass:

Battle of Nalapani

The Battle of Nalapani was the first battle of the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814–1816. The forces of the British East India Company fought against Nepal, then ruled by the House of Gorkha. The battle took place around the Nalapani fort, near Dehradun. The British besieged the fort between 31 October and 30 November 1814. The fort's garrison was commanded by Captain Balbhadra Kunwar. Major-General Rollo Gillespie, who had previously fought in the Battle of Java, was in charge of the attacking British troops. Gillespie was killed on the first day of the siege while rallying his men and despite considerable odds, both in terms of numbers and firepower, Balbhadra and his 600-strong garrison successfully held out against more than 5,000 British troops for over a month.

First two costly attempts to seize the fort by direct attack were unsuccessful. The British then tried to force the garrison to surrender by cutting off the fort's water supply. After three days of thirst, on the last day of the siege, Balbhadra refused to surrender. He led the 70 surviving members of the garrison in a charge against the besieging force. Fighting their way out of the fort, the survivors escaped into the nearby hills. Considering the time, effort, and resources spent to capture the small fort, it was a pyrrhic victory for the British. A number of later engagements, including one at Jaithak, unfolded in a similar way; but more than any other battle of the war, the fighting around Nalapani established the Gurkhas' reputation as warriors. As a result, they were later recruited by the British to serve in their army.

Surgical mask

A surgical mask, also known as a procedure mask, medical mask or simply a face mask, is a mask. It is intended to be worn by health professionals during surgery and during nursing. Such masks are used to catch the bacteria shed in liquid droplets and aerosols from the wearer's mouth and nose. They are not designed to protect the wearer from inhaling airborne bacteria or virus particles and are less effective than respirators, which provide better protection.

There are different qualities of such mask. Despite their name, not all surgical masks should be used during surgeries. Chinese health officials distinguish between medical (non-surgical) and surgical masks.

Surgical masks are made of a nonwoven fabric created using a melt blowing process. They came into use in the 1960s and largely replaced cloth facemasks in developed countries. A shortage of surgical masks is a central issue of the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.

Surgical masks are popularly worn by the general public all year round in East Asian countries like China, Japan and South Korea to reduce the chance of spreading airborne diseases to others, and to prevent the breathing in of airborne dust particles created by air pollution. Additionally, surgical masks have become a fashion statement, particularly in contemporary East Asian culture bolstered by its popularity in Japanese and Korean pop culture which have a big impact on East Asian youth culture.

Silent letter

Silent letters are letters written in words that, when spoken, do not correspond to the pronunciation of a given letter and also do not allow anyone to hear their sound when they appear in the word. 

Many of them come from Old English. These include the "k" in "know" and "knee", the second "b" in "bomb" and "numb," the "s" in "island," and the "e" in "lame" and "lime". There is also a silent "g" in "sign", which is from Middle English. Old English uses the sound of the silent "k" and "gh" from "knight", which was pronounced at the time. The word changed its history. Other words, such as "knowledge", also begin with silent "k" when the letter "n" comes after it. There is also the silent "r" that happens to be in many other words from Old English, such as the one that happens to be heard in former words such as "February" that can be sounded and sometimes it is also silent unlike how you kneel as well as that silent "d" in "Wednesday" that happens to be the first as well as that"." There is also the silent "n" at the end of other words, such as "autumn". The word "wrong" means not right, and begins with silent "w". There are words that sometimes begin with silent "g", such as "gnat". 

Other silent letters may be the "r" in words from Old French, like "hors d'ouvert" and the sound of the "t" is sometimes heard in some words like "often," but it may also be silent. There is also a silent "w" in "answer", and the "w" is not pronounced. The word "kneel" starts with a silent "k". The letter "g" has two sounds, both hard and soft, but it is sometimes silent at the beginning of the word "gnat" when it comes before the letter "n" that comes after it. You can sometimes say the silent "g" for fun in order to start a word, such as "gnome" or "gnat" because they may be completely different. That is why the completely silent "g" in "gnat" happens to be quite different from other consonants, and you can only believe that it is near what you might keep remembering after you remember. Also, "gnome" is very different from that! We had that. One word, which is "gneiss", is written like "nice", but it is only a particular rock that starts with that silent "g" before that "n". 

Silent letters exist in the spelling systems in many languages. They are very common in languages with deep orthographies, spelling systems with little one-to-one relationship between letters and sounds, like English, French, Thai, and Mongolian.

Joseph: King of Dreams

Joseph: King of Dreams is a DreamWorks Animation movie and a prequel to The Prince of Egypt. It is based on the story of Joseph in the Book of Genesis. It stars Ben Affleck as Joseph and Mark Hamill as Judah (Biblical personage).

Jacob is an old man by the time his favorite wife Rachel, who, he was once told, could never have children, gives birth to a baby named Joseph. Jacob sees Joseph is a miracle and says that he must have a great destiny because he is a miracle child. Years later, Jacob gives him a colorful coat to prove Joseph is his favorite son. Joseph’s half-brothers get jealous of him especially after Joseph starts to have dreams in which he rises over them. After Joseph starts to tell their father Jacob bad reports about them, they get very angry. When Reuben tries to make peace with Joseph because they are brothers Joseph tells him that he’s not his brother but his half-brother. Joseph’s half-brothers under the leadership of Judah then kidnap him and sell him into slavery. Joseph is taken to Egypt and has to serve an Egyptian captain named Potiphar, who is obsessed with honor. Joseph becomes well-treated by Potiphar and meets a woman named Asenath with whom he falls in love. Potiphar’s wife decides she wants Joseph but he turns her down because she is already married. When she frames Joseph for rape, Potiphar realizes that she is lying but refused to admit it because of what believing a slave over his wife would say about his honor and Joseph is sent to jail. He explains the dreams of other prisoners. When Pharaoh cannot find anyone else to explain his dreams, he asks Joseph who predicts seven years of having grown plenty of grain and seven years of famine. Joseph is put in charge of collecting the extra food during the years of plenty so that Egypt can survive the famine. Joseph married Asenath. When Judah and his brothers go to Egypt looking for food, Joseph at first wants revenge, but Asenath suggests him to forgive them. Joseph comes up with a test to find out if they deserve his forgiveness. They summon Benjamin, Rachel’s only other son, who became Jacob’s favorite after he was told that Joseph died, to Egypt and framed him for theft, threatening to enslave him as punishment. When the brothers, under the leadership of Judah all offer themselves in Benjamin’s place, Joseph asks why they would give up everything for “a spoiled half-brother”, Judah, who does not recognize Joseph, tells him the truth about how he and his brothers sold Joseph into slavery out of jealousy and how they want more than anything else. Joseph reveals that he is actually himself. He forgives them because God brought him to Egypt to save lives.


The movie never mentioned in the Bible that Jacob’s oldest son is Reuben.
Rachel died giving birth to Benjamin in the Bible, while the brothers sold Joseph to the slave traders.

The movie was compared unfavorably to The Prince of Egypt. Though there were some critics who said that Joseph was better in relation to spirituality when one compared the song You Know Better than I and When You Believe.

Multiculturalism in Canada

Multiculturalism in Canada is a very important part of the culture of Canada. Beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, the Canadian government officially began pushing for multiculturalism in policy. Because of this, the federal government has sometimes been called the "instigator" (or starters) of multiculturalism being an ideology. They often try to bring attention to the importance of immigration to Canada.
Canadians use the word "multiculturalism" in many different ways. Sometimes they use it to describe the many different religious traditions and cultural influences. They say that this creates a very special cultural mosaic of Canada. The country is full of people that come from many different racial, religious, and cultural origins. Since Canada was created, there has been a lot of immigration. By the beginning of the 21st century, there were more people that were not of a British or French background.

In Canada there are many examples of multiculturalism. for example, Canada lets in refugees, immigrants, and do not care about any race, religion, or culture. Canada also has their immigration leader an immigrant.

Pachyderm

Pachyderm (meaning 'thick skin', from the Greek , and ) is an old term for
elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses.

Genetics has now shown that rhinos, hippos, and elephants are not closely related to each other. Rhinos are closely related to tapirs, but both rhinos and tapirs are much more closely related to horses than to hippos or elephants. 

The closest relatives of hippos are whales and dolphins. Hippos and whales are more closely related to cows, pigs, deer, antelopes, and giraffes than other pachyderms. 

The closest relatives of elephants seem to be manatees, dugongs, and hyraxes, which are all only distantly related to other pachyderms.

Instead of being descended from a common ancestor, today's science shows that these animals just made similar adaptations independently through convergent evolution.

Elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses are classified as separate clades altogether. Rhinos, hippos, pigs, peccaries, horses, zebras, donkeys and tapirs are classified in clade Laurasiatheria, while elephants, hyraxes, manatees and dugongs are classified in clade Afrotheria.

Spanish alphabet

The Spanish alphabet is a Latin alphabet of 27 letters used to write the Spanish language. It has the same letters as the ISO Basic Latin Alphabet with the additional letter Ñ, which is named "Eñe" (pronounced EN-yay). In addition to letters, the alphabet also uses accent marks to mark stressed syllables. The Spanish alphabet is fairly phonemic, which means words are usually spelled the way the sound. While different accents exist in Spanish like with any living language, pronunciation is usually fits well with spelling.

The letter combinations "CH", "LL" and "RR" used to be included as letters of the Spanish alphabet and sorted by themselves in dictionaries (but not "RR," since no Spanish words begin with "RR"), and thus the Spanish alphabet used to contain 30 letters until they were removed. They are no longer letters of the Spanish alphabet and are now just letter combinations with their own sounds. The letter K is limited in Spanish and mostly only occurs in foreign words borrowed from other languages. There are, however, some native Spanish words that do begin with the letter K (e.g. Kilo, Kilogramo, Kilómetro, etc.), and the letter W does not appear in original Spanish words, only in foreign words borrowed from other languages, and thus is hardly almost ever used in Spanish at all.

NBA Most Valuable Player Award

The National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since the 1955–56 season to the best performing player of the regular season. The winner receives the Maurice Podoloff Trophy, which is named in honor of the first commissioner (then president) of the NBA, who served from 1946 until 1963. Until the 1979–80 season, the MVP was selected by a vote of NBA players. Since the 1980–81 season, the award is decided by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada.

Each member of the voting panel casts a vote for first to fifth place selections. Each first-place vote is worth 10 points; each second-place vote is worth seven; each third-place vote is worth five, fourth-place is worth three and fifth-place is worth one. Starting from 2010, one ballot was cast by fans through online voting. The player with the highest point total wins the award. As of June 2019, the current holder of the award is Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers.

Every player who has won this award and has been eligible for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame has been inducted. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won the award a record six times. He is also the only player to win the award despite his team not making the playoffs back in the 1975–76 season.

Shaquille O'Neal in 1999–2000 and James in 2012–13 are the only two players to have fallen one vote shy of a unanimous selection, both receiving 120 of 121 votes. Since the 1975–76 season, only two players have been named MVP for a season in which their team failed to win at least 50 regular-season games—Moses Malone (twice, 1978–79 and 1981–82) and Russell Westbrook (2016–17).

Chicken tikka masala

Chicken tikka masala is a curry in Pakistani cuisine that is made up of roasted marinated chicken (chicken tikka) in a curry sauce full of spices. Chicken tikka is made up of boneless pieces of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt, then roasted in an oven. The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. Even though a sauce made of tomato and coriander is commonly used, there is no specific recipe for the sauce that everyone uses.

Chicken tikka masala is very popular in the United Kingdom, and it has been called a "true British national dish", as declared by British Minister Robin Cook. It is growing in popularity in the USA and Canada as well. Even though some consider it to have been originated by a Pakistani, the dish is unknown in most Pakistan. It can be found in restaurants in various parts of the world, due to its demand, not authenticity.

The oldest reference to chicken tikka masala is found in 1960s, where a Bangladeshi Chef, Ali Ahmad Aslam, created the dish in his restaurant in Glasgow, on request of a customer who was unhappy with the chicken tikka. Aslam is said to have invented chicken tikka masala by adding spices to a tin of tomato soup. Aslam died in 2022 at the age of 77.

Chef Anita Jaisinghani, a correspondent in the "Houston Chronicle", wrote that "the most likely story is that the modern version was created during the early ’70s by an enterprising Indian chef near London" who used Campbell's tomato soup. This is disputed by author Jo Monroe, who claims that this story was invented by the founder of a London restaurant "to entertain journalists".

Rahul Verma, a food critic who writes for "The Hindu" newspaper, claims: "It's basically a Punjabi dish not more than 40–50 years old and must be an accidental discovery which has had periodical improvisations."

My Little Pony

]
My Little Pony is a toy and children's entertainment franchise. The first toys were released in 1981 under Hasbro's Romper Room line of toys.

The toys were first called "My Pretty Pony," but Hasbro changed the name. The My Pretty Ponies were the colors of real horses and could move their ears. They had manes and tails that the player could comb.

Hasbro changed the way the My Little Pony toys look many times. These different groups of toys are called "Generations" by fans and collectors. The second group of toys from the 1980s are called Generation One or G1. There was also a G2 and G3. The toys related to the "Friendship Is Magic" series are called G4.

Starting with the G1 series, each toy pony, unicorn or pegasus (winged horse) came in bright colors for example pink and blue, and a "cutie mark," or symbol on its rear end. The symbol usually had something to do with its name and personality. For example, the pegasus pony named Firefly had blue lightning bolts for her cutie mark. Fireflies are also called lightning bugs.

In 1986, Hasbro made a cartoon for television called "My Little Pony n' Friends" to sell My Little Ponies and other toys. In it, the My Little Ponies live in a place called Dream Valley and go on adventures with a human farmgirl named Megan. They have many different kinds of creatures for friends and enemies. The first half of each episode was a My Little Pony story with a song. The second half of each episode was about other Hasbro characters such as the Potato Head Kids, Moondreamers, or Glow Friends, also with a song.

The first My Little Pony movie was a TV special called "Return to Midnight Castle", later renamed "Escape from Midnight Castle". The My Little Pony movies and TV specials were later shortened, cut into smaller pieces and put on television as episodes of the show.

In 1992, Hasbro made a cartoon television show called "My Little Pony Tales" to sell the G2 My Little Pony toys. In it, the characters live in a place called Ponyland. Neither the G2 toy line nor "My Little Pony Tales" was as successful as G1 in the United States.

In 2010, Lauren Faust released a new My Little Pony cartoon series called "". In this series, the ponies live in a place called Equestria.

European polecat

The European polecat ("Mustela putorius")  is a species of mustelid native to western Eurasia and north Morocco. It is also known as the common polecat, black or forest polecat, European ferret, wild ferret, foumart, fitch, or simply polecat. It is dark brown, with a pale underbelly and a dark mask across the face. Occasionally, there are other color variations, such as albinos. The family it is in also contains minks and other weasels. Compared to them, the polecat has a shorter, more compact body; a more powerfully built skull and teeth; and is less agile. It is well known for its ability to secrete a particularly foul-smelling liquid to mark its territory.

It is much less territorial than other mustelid. Animals of the same sex frequently share home ranges. Like other mustelids, the European polecat is polygamous, with pregnancy occurring after mating, with no induced ovulation. It usually gives birth in early summer to litters consisting of five to ten kits, which become independent at the age of two to three months. The European polecat feeds on small rodents, birds, amphibians and reptiles. It occasionally cripples its prey by piercing its brain with its teeth and stores it, still living, in its burrow for future consumption.

The European polecat originated in Western Europe during the Middle Pleistocene. its closest living relatives are the steppe polecat, the black-footed ferret and the European mink. It can produce fertile offspring with the steppe polecat and the black-footed ferret. Hybrids of polecat and mink tend to be sterile, and are distinguished from their parent species by their larger size and more valuable pelts.

The European polecat is the only ancestor of the ferret, which was domesticated more than 2000 years ago for hunting vermin. The species has otherwise been historically viewed negatively by humans. In the British Isles especially, the polecat was persecuted by gamekeepers, and became synonymous with promiscuity in early English literature. During modern times, the polecat is still scantly represented in popular culture when compared to other rare British mammals, and misunderstandings of its behaviour still persist in some rural areas. , it is classed by the IUCN as Least Concern due to its wide range and large numbers.

As well as the several indigenous names referring to smell (see above), the scientific name "Mustela putorius" is also derived from this species' foul smell. The Latin "putorius" translates to "stench" or "stink" and is the origin of the English word "putrid".

2020 Nova Scotia attacks

On April 18–19, 2020, fifty-one-year-old Gabriel Wortman committed multiple shootings and set fires at 16 places in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. He killed twenty-two people and injured three others before the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) shot and killed him in Enfield.

The attack lasted for thirteen hours. Wortman impersonated a police officer for part of the attack by driving a car he had made to look like a police car and wearing a police uniform. The killings were not terrorism, but police do not yet know the reason Wortman did these killings. He had guns even though he didn't have a licence, so police are trying to find out how he got the guns.

Police did not use Canada's Alert Ready system, which could have sent messages to the phones of people in the area of Wortman to stay inside. Many people think they should have used it, and police are trying to find out why it wasn't used. 

It is the deadliest attack of its kind in Canadian history.

The attack began as domestic violence between Wortman and his girlfriend in their home in Portapique, Nova Scotia, which is north of Halifax. They had came home from a party and were arguing. Wortman attacked her and she ran away into the woods. Wortman then set fire to his house and went back to the party. He began shooting at the people there and killed seven.

Many calls to the police were made about more shootings and fires outside of eight homes in Portapique from 10:14p.m. RMCP officers arrived twelve minutes later at 10:26P.M. and found that thirteen more people had been shot dead by Wortman and three houses had been set on fire. Police said many had died while trying to escape the flames or help other victims. By the time they had got there, Wortman had already escaped. Another man said he had been shot and injured by a man driving a police car.

Police quickly realised that Wortman had probably committed the crimes and started a search of Portapique for him. RMCP made a tweet telling the people in the town to stay inside and lock their doors.

Police found Wortman's girlfriend at 6:30a.m. and she told them that Wortman had a fake police car and gave them a photo of it. A BOLO was sent out to all police officers in Nova Scotia telling them to look for a fake police car. Police then announced there was an active shooter situation.

At around 8:00a.m., a 9-1-1 caller reported an explosion and gunfire at a house in Wentworth, Nova Scotia, about north of Portapique. The two residents of the house and a neighbour were killed. Wortman went to another house in police uniform but the people wouldn't let him in and called the police, so Wortman left. At 9:35a.m., he shot and killed a woman who was walking in Wentworth Valley. He then went south back towards Portapique.

From 10:54a.m., Wortman was seen in Glenholme, Debert, Onslow, and Brookfield, in that order. This would show him heading towards Halifax. In this time, he performed two traffic stops pretending to be a police officer and shot and killed both drivers.

Sometime before 10:49a.m., Wortman stopped next to a police officer's car in Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia and shot him. This injured the officer and he drove to a hospital and survived. He then continued down the road and crashed head on into another police officer's car who was driving. The female officer began shooting at Wortman, but was killed by him. He stole her gun and ammunition and set her car on fire. He then shot and killed someone who tried to help the officer before stealing his silver Chervrolet Tracker car and driving south.

A short time later, he killed a woman he knew in her home in Shubenacadie and stole her Mazda 3 car. He was later seen driving south through Milford, near Halifax.

At 11:26a.m., Wortman drove into a rest area near Enfield, Nova Scotia., south of Portapique and north of Halifax. A police officer saw him and knew who he was and shot Wortman dead.

In total, Wortman had murdered 22 people and injured 3 others.

The perpetrator of the attacks was 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, who was a denturist who lived in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. He had been arrested for assault before in 2001, but was given 9 months of probation.

Atlantic sailfish

The Atlantic sailfish ("Istiophorus albicans") is a species of marine fish in the family Istiophoridae of the order Perciformes. It is found in the Atlantic Oceans and the Caribbean Sea, from the surface to depths of . It does not occur in large areas of the central North Atlantic and the central South Atlantic. The Atlantic sailfish is related to the marlin.

Tests in the 1920s estimated that the Atlantic sailfish was capable of short sprints of up to 111 kilometres per hour; however, more conservative estimates of 37 to 55 kilometres per hour are more widely accepted. More recent studies even suggest sailfish do not exceed swimming speeds of .

Atlantic sailfish hunt schooling fish, such as sardines, anchovies and mackerel although they also feed on crustaceans and cephalopods.

The Atlantic sailfish is a metallic blue fish with a large sail-like dorsal fin and a long and pointed bill-like snout. It is dark bluish-black on the upperparts and lighter on the sides (counter-shading). There are about twenty bluish horizontal bars along the flanksThe underparts are silvery white. The tail fin is strongly forked. The fins are bluish-black and the front dorsal fin is speckled with small black spots. The bases of the anal fins are pale.

The length of this fish is up to and the maximum published weight is .

Studies found that sailfish hunting schools of sardines rely heavily upon stealth and quick slashing or tapping with the rostrum in order to temporarily immobilize prey and make capturing small prey easier. The bill has been hypothesized to increase the hydrodynamic qualities of the fish and even to ward off predators. However, it has been well documented that the sailfish use the bill for hunting.

The Atlantic sailfish is a pelagic fish of tropical and temperate waters in the Atlantic Ocean. It ranges from approximately 40°N in the northwestern Atlantic to 40°S in the southwestern Atlantic, and 50°N in the northeastern Atlantic to 32°S in the southeastern Atlantic. It is a migratory species and moves about the open ocean and into the Mediterranean Sea. Its depth range is from warm surface waters down to about .

Some authorities only recognise a single species of sailfish, "Istiophorus platypterus", with "I. albicans" being treated as a synonym for "I. platyperus".

At the Flanders house, Ned goes to take Bart fishing. When Bart catches a fish, Ned teaches him how to roast it in a fire. Bart also joins a church choir and everyone in the church congratulate Ned for making Bart a better person. This makes Homer jealous.

Homer walks around the city and finds Nelson Muntz at a landfill crying because of what is going on at his home.

Club" gave the episode a score of C- and said that "'Better Off Ned' isn’t just a lousy half-hour (minus commercials, minus three episode-ending tags in place of any sort of resolution) of The Simpsons because it’s double-dipping on the same premise. It’s a truly lousy episode because it fairly rings with indifference, glib cruelty, and enough lamp-shading of creative exhaustion to serve as platonic ideal for late-run ‘is that show still on?’ disposability." "Den of Geek" gave the episode a 3 out of 5 stars and says "'Better Off Ned' is sweet but feels like a doughnut where the creamy middle has been sucked out. It doesn’t quite miss the edge as much as it dulls it. The opportunities are here for sharper comedy, but the episode cuts across the surface."

On Halloween night in 2019, 21-year-old Corey Cunningham is babysitting a young boy named Jeremy, who pulls a prank on Corey by locking him inside the attic. Just as Jeremy's parents come home, Corey kicks the door open and accidentally knocks Jeremy over a staircase railing to his death. Corey is accused of intentionally killing Jeremy but is cleared of manslaughter.

Three years later, the town of Haddonfield, Illinois is still reeling from the aftermath of Michael Myers's latest extended killing spree in 2018, while Michael has vanished. Laurie Strode is writing a memoir, having bought a new house and living with Allyson, her granddaughter, who is now a nurse. Meanwhile, Corey is working at his stepfather's salvage yard. On his way home one day, he is taunted by high school bullies and injures himself in the process. An observing Laurie brings him to the doctor's office where Allyson works. Allyson and Corey develop a relationship and later attend a Halloween party, where Corey is confronted by Jeremy's mother. Corey leaves the party and runs into the bullies, who throw him off a bridge. Dragged into the sewers by an unknown figure, he wakes up and is confronted by Michael, who has been living there for the past four years. After holding him by the throat, Michael lets Corey go. On the way out, Corey is confronted by a homeless man and takes out a knife previously given to him by Laurie. In a struggle, Corey stabs the man to death and flees.

Corey and Allyson go on a dinner date, but Allyson's ex-boyfriend, police officer Doug Mulaney, shows up and harasses them both. Corey later lures the cop into the sewer. Michael emerges and although in a weakened state murders Doug to Corey's delight. Corey decides to become a new boogeyman figure and to take vengeance upon anyone who wronged him and Allyson. Allyson is passed over for a promotion at work, in favor of a fellow nurse who is having an affair with the doctor. Corey then kills the doctor at his home while the nurse is killed by Michael, who followed Corey.

An unknowing Allyson plans to leave Haddonfield with an insistent Corey because of the past trauma, while Laurie becomes increasingly suspicious of Corey after he begins mimicking Michael's behavior. After finding him sleeping in the spot Jeremy died, Laurie offers to help him on the condition he leaves Allyson alone. Corey retorts by blaming her for the events that have occurred in Haddonfield and says if he cannot have Allyson, no one will.

On October 31, Corey returns to the sewers and successfully fights a still-weak Michael for his mask. Meanwhile, Laurie and Allyson argue as she plans to leave and Allyson, too, blames Laurie for Michael's actions. That night, Corey embarks on a rampage, murdering the bullies after luring them to the salvage yard. In the confusion, Corey's stepfather is also accidentally killed. He then goes on to kill his mother, as well as the DJ and receptionist at the radio station.

Back at the Strode house, Laurie faux-attempts suicide to lure Corey to her, whom she shoots down the stairs. Corey then stabs himself in the neck to frame Laurie for his death in front of the arriving Allyson. Michael suddenly arrives to retrieve his mask and kills Corey. During a fight between Laurie and Michael, Laurie stabs Michael in the hands, pinning him to the table. She stabs him in the chest and neck before removing his mask and slitting his throat, but he breaks one arm free and strangles her before Allyson arrives and breaks his arm. Laurie slices his wrist, finally killing him.

Laurie and Allyson take his body to the salvage yard by police escort, attracting the residents of Haddonfield, who follow them in a procession, and dispose of it in an industrial shredder. In the ensuing days, Allyson and Laurie reconcile, and Allyson leaves Haddonfield while Laurie finishes her memoir and rediscovers her romance with Deputy Hawkins.

It takes place every two years - since 1975 with preselection in so-called "state competitions" in the state capitals and the "federal competition" in Leoben. Participants are delegated from all Austrian federal states. The Tyrolean delegation also includes participants from South Tyrol.

In the Austrian competition, the number of participants rose from 235 in 1969 to over 2000 from 1989. The representatives of the federal states worked out reform proposals (annual implementation, division into a more funding-oriented basic competition and a top competition based on the professional training standard, inclusion of missing instruments and instrumentation, introduction of a binding “compulsory piece” from the 20th century, etc.). In 1993 the competition was last held nationwide under the old name. As an alternative, the federal states and the federal ministries concerned with the aspects of youth, school and university as well as music funding founded the organization Musik der Jugend, which organizes the Prima la musica competition.

In Leoben itself, the sponsoring association continued to hold smaller competitions under the name "Jugend musiziert" it protected in the following years, albeit limited to individual categories and at irregular intervals.
