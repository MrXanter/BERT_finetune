Del Amitri

Del Amitri is a Scottish alternative rock band formed in Glasgow in 1980. Between 1985 and 2002, the band released six studio albums. Their 1995 single "Roll to Me" reached number 10 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. Five have reached the Top 10 in the UK. Del Amitri have sold six million albums around the world.

Del Amitri's member and songwriter, Justin Currie, said in 2010 that the band's name "was invented to be meaningless – basically a corruption of the Greek name 'Dimitri'." In 2018, he said that 'Del Amitri' was based on the name of the producer of a movie he saw in 1979 – "...probably Dimitri-something, but we couldn't remember..." Many sources have said that the name was chosen because it is Greek for "from the womb", but this is untrue.





The current members of the band are:

Currie and Harvie are the main songwriters for the band.

Former members of the band are:

Frame rate

Frame rate is a way of describing video. It refers to the number of images, called frames, that are being shown every second. It is measured in frames per second, or FPS.

Early silent movies were shown at a frame rate between 16 and 24 frames per second. This went up to 20 and 26 FPS later. When movies with sound came out 24 FPS became the standard because it was in the middle of the frame rates theaters used.

Video games are usually played at a frame rate of 60 frames per second. This is because it is a very common refresh rate (display speed) for computer monitors. They also can run at 30 FPS, or even more, such as 144 FPS or 240 FPS, depending on what the monitor can handle. If the frame rate is higher than the refresh rate, not all of the frames can be shown. If two or more frames are displayed at the same time, it can cause problems like screen tearing.

Screen tearing

Screen tearing is a type of video error. It can happen when multiple video frames are displayed at a single time on a computer monitor. The frames will each be shown on different parts of the screen, and can leave horizontal lines if the pictures are different at the point.

Screen tearing can be stopped by synchronizing the frames that are put on the screen. Vertical synchronization, or VSync, is one popular way. Another way is FreeSync or G-Sync, but these options only work with certain GPUs and monitors.

Diet of Worms

The Diet of Worms was a council of the Holy Roman Empire in the city of Worms. The council was held because of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. It lasted for five months in early 1521. The Emperor, Charles V led the council. Other councils (called Imperial Diets) were held in Worms in the years 829, 926, 1076, 1122, 1495, and 1545, but the most important Diet of Worms was in 1521.
In June 1520, Pope Leo X wrote the Papal bull Exsurge Domine ("Arise, O Lord"), in which he talked about 41 problems he saw in Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses and his other works. Because of this, the Holy Roman Emperor told Martin Luther to come to the diet. He promised that he would give Luther safe passage to and from it. The Diet started on 23 January 1521. Martin Luther was told that he had to either take back what he had said or defend it.
Most of the important things in the Diet happened between 16-18 April. On 16 April, Martin Luther got to the city of Worms. He was told to come to the Diet at 4 p.m. on the 17th, and given a lawyer. After a day of arguing about his works, he was told that he was acting like a heretic. On the 18th of April, he went home. But Frederick III, Elector of Saxony thought that someone might kill him, so he faked a highway ambush and used this as a reason to hide Luther in one of his castles.

By 23 May 1521, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, Archduke of Austria, King of Spain (Castile and Aragon), King of Germany, King of Italy, Lord of the Netherlands, and Titular Duke of Burgundy had had enough of all of this Martin Luther business, so he wrote:

After that, he ended the Diet of Worms.

However, because Luther was hidden in Wartburg Castle, nothing ever happened to him.

Dual in-line package

A dual in-line package is one way of making microchips and other integrated circuits. The circuit is put inside of a container made out of materials such as plastic or ceramic. All the wires of the circuit are connected to metal pins, and they stick out of the package on two sides. This way the circuit is able to be used from inside the package.

Things can also be put in a dual in-line package that are not integrated circuits. A DIP switch is one example of this, where there are switches on top of the package instead of a circuit inside.

Think not of those, who are slain in the way of Allah, as dead. Nay, they are living. With their Lord they have provision. Jubilant (are they) because of that which Allah hath bestowed upon them of His bounty, rejoicing for the sake of those who have not joined them but are left behind: That there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.

- Quran 3:169–170 

Lo! Allah hath bought from the believers their lives and their wealth because the Garden will be theirs: they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be slain. It is a promise which is binding on Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur'an. Who fulfilleth His covenant better than Allah? Rejoice then in your bargain that ye have made, for that is the supreme triumph.

- Quran 9:111

Those who fled their homes for the cause of Allah and then were slain or died, Allah verily will provide for them a good provision. Lo! Allah, He verily is Best of all who make provision. Assuredly He will cause them to enter by an entry that they will love. Lo! Allah verily is Knower, Indulgent.

Parspatunik

Parspatunik,Parspatuniq(in , also Parasapatene and Patsparunik, Parparunik) was the 26th district of Vaspurakan province and the largest region (550 km ²) of the kingdom of Greater Armenia. After 72 A.D. Parspatuniq became principality of Great Armenia, which owned two regions (Parspatunik and Marand) in the province of Vaspurakan. The region belonged to the princely family of Parspatuni(Patsparuni, Parspuni, Parsparuni).

In antiquity, the main territory of Parspatunik (modern Karadag) was part of the Scythian state-tribal entity. In the western part of Parspatunik, Marand, the center of the ancient region Sangibutu,Ulhu was located . Then the region was part of the kingdom of Urartu. Subsequently, these areas again fell into the power of the Scythians. They later became part of the Median Empire. After the division of the empire of Alexander the Great,еаstern Parspatunik became part of the Media Atropatena. Artashes I annexed еastern Parspatunik to Great Armenia during the military campaign 
. Marand was part of the Armenian kingdom before the conquests of King Artashes I.

The princely clan of Parspatuni descended from the Matianian kings of Sangibutu.
Having become princes, the naxarars of Parspatuni united under their rule the regions of Parspatunik and Marand, choosing the Marand's Bakurarakert(Greco-Roman Philadelphia) as their capital.

Parspatunik was not included into Vaspurakan after the second partition of Great Armenia in 591 by the Roman and Sasanids empires.

Then, later, under the rule of the Arab caliphate, the region is no longer part of Vaspurakan. The population of Parspatunik was significantly Islamized during the Caliphate.

Parspatunik was located between the river Araxes from the north and Parthian empire in the south.

The wooded mountain range of Parspatunik(Matiani mts.) was also known in Antiquity as Αρμενιωο Ορη - the Armenian Mountains, in which there was a passage Αρμενιων πυλών - Armenian Gate (Դրունք Հայոց), what was described in the III-rd century B.C. by a Greek author Eratosthenes(280-202 B.C.) and mentioned again by a XIV-th century Muslim historiographer Hamballah Ghazvini. The road passing through the Armenian Gate in the Middle Ages led to the famous Khudapery Bridge.

By its geographical position, Parspatunik was located on the border of the Armenian and Parthian kingdoms. This circumstance explains the Armenian name of the region, which translates as “Wall of Persia” from the words “Pars”(Persia) and “pat”(wall), due to the fact that the Matiani mountains of Parspatunik served as the ancient border between Armenia and Iran.
In the I-VI centuries, this region was the 26th ghawar(region) and the principality of the Armenian province of Vaspurakan, as mentioned by the 7th-century Armenian geographer and historian Anania Shirakatsi .

The population of Parspatunik consisted mоstly of Iranian(Atropatenian and Caspian) tribes.
The Armenian population, previously Matiene and Alarodian tribes, was concentrated in the towns and wooded mountainous areas near the fortresses, where it still existing to this day in modern Iran.

In the mountainous wooded territory of Parspatunik (Karadag), adjacent to the right bank of the Araxes, there were small Armenian melikdoms until the end of the First World War.

Political map of the Armenian Highlands in the 16th century during the period of the Turkish-Persian Wars,map of the region in the first half of the XVIIIth century

Some of the Armenian melikdoms of Karadag(Parspatunik) were founded by settlers from Karabakh(Artsakh).

The modern historical region of Parspatunik is located on the territory of the Iranian region Arasbaran(Karadag) and was abandoned by the majority of the Armenian population during the repatriation period 1946-1947. A large number of monuments of Armenian architecture have been preserved in the region.
The remaining Armenian population of Parspatunik (Karadag) is concentrated in the mountainous region, on the border of the Iranian provinces of Ardabil and East Azerbaijan.

Black Panther (movie)

Black Panther is a 2018 superhero movie set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and starring Chadwick Boseman as T’Challa / Black Panther and Michael B. Jordan as the supervillain Erik Killmonger.

Thousands of years ago an asteroid crashes into an African country called Wakanda containing an alien metal called vibranium which absorbs vibrations and is the world’s strongest metal as a result. The tribes of Wakanda went to war for the vibranium but then decided to unite under the leadership of a king called the Black Panther. Only one tribe goes into exile in the mountains of Wakanda so that they do not have to be ruled by the Black Panther. Because of using vibranium to make weapons the Wakandans managed to stop anyone else from ever conquering their country and as a result they became the world’s most technologically advanced nation but kept that a secret from everyone else by creating a giant force field around the country and having no relationship with the outside world. Then in the late 20th century T’chaka, King of Wakanda finds out that his brother who is an undercover spy in the United States is secretly smuggling vibranium to the US to help oppressed black people to overthrow the white man. T’chaka then kills his brother and leaves his body unburied to return to Wakanda. T’chaka’s brother’s son finds his father’s body dead and swears to get revenge. Then in 2018, T’chaka’s son T’challa comes back to Wakanda to become the new king following T’chaka’s murder in the movie . M’baku comes from the mountains and challenges T’challa to a fight to become Black Panther. T’challa wins and convinces M’Baku to surrender so that he doesn’t have to kill him. T’challa’s cousin turns out to have joined the American army and worked as an assassin for the CIA known as Killmonger. He since left the CIA and hired a supervillain named Klaue to help him rob the British Museum of its Wakandan artifacts and then murder everyone there. T’challa finds out that Klaue is in South Korea and goes there as the Black Panther to try and capture him only to find himself fighting the CIA. Klaue is captured by CIA agent Everett Ross with T’challa’s help and Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda is actually a rich country. Klaue escapes with Killmonger’s help and Ross is hurt. T’challa takes Ross to Wakanda so that his doctors can fix him. Killmonger then gets Klaue to take him to Wakanda only to reveal to Klaue that he is actually a Wakandan prince and kills Klaue. He then delivers Klaue’s body to Wakanda in exchange for an audience with T’challa and demand the throne. Killmonger and T’challa fight to the death and Killmonger wins. Killmonger becomes King of Wakanda and then wants to use the Wakandan military to conquer all white people in the world and punish them for their crimes against black people. T’challa’s family reaches out to M’baku and asks him to fight Killmonger. M’baku reveals that T’challa survived the fight without having surrendered and that he rescued an injured T’challa to repay him for having spared his life. T’challa is healed by M’baku and T’challa confronts Killmonger. Killmonger has no plan to fight T’challa since he believes that now that he is king there is no need for violence. T’challa tries to get the throne back by fighting to the death against Killmonger and wins. T’challa then decides to share Wakanda’s technology with the world. 

The Black Panther movie was generally praised by the critics and was actually nominated for an Oscar. The CIA helped promote the movie on its Twitter account before the Oscars.

Multiple integral

In calculus and mathematical analysis, an integral is a way to calculate the limiting value a function with one variable will tend towards. Graphically, this can then be shown as the area under the graph of the function. In multivariate calculus, It is also possible to calculate integrals for functions with more than one variable. These integrals are commonly referred to as multiple integrals. 

An integral for a function with two variables over a two-dimensional region, called double integral, can be shown as a surface in three dimensional space. Similarly, an integral for a function with three variables over a three-dimensional region, called triple integral, can be thought of as a hypervolume. 

A double integral can also be used to define an integral over an arbitrary surface (surface integral), just like a triple integral can be used to define an integral over an arbitrary volume (volume integral).

Citizen science

Citizen science is when regular people help scientists study the world. Citizen scientists usually collect information and send it to a team of scientists, who examine and process it. Most citizen scientists are volunteers and do not get paid.

Sometimes scientists ask for help from people who are collecting information anyway. For example, scientists studying birds might ask birdwatchers to record which birds they see and hear and then tell the scientists. The National Audubon Society has been running a Christmas Bird Count since 1900.

Smartphones and GPS have made citizen science easier to do and easier for scientists to ask for and use. For example, in FrogWatch USA, citizen scientists go to places where frogs live and use their phones to make recordings of the sounds they hear.

Not all citizen science programs mean going outside. In EyeWire, volunteers visit a website and click on what they can see. This helps scientists tell how the brain works with things the eyes see.

In other citizen science programs, volunteers measure temperature to track climate change, tell scientists when different plants start to grow in the spring, search for aliens in space, and design better bicycle routes.

The show is known for having black actors as the Founding Fathers and other historical figures, which is far from reality. Through this use of modern storytelling methods, "Hamilton" has been called for being the "America then, as told by morons now."

A movie, which is a live recording of the musical with the original cast, was released on Disney+ on July 3, 2020.

A nineteen-year-old orphan named Alexander Hamilton moves from the Caribbean to New York where he meets Aaron Burr who tells him to “talk less, smile more, don’t let anyone know what you're against or what you're for” then they go to a bar where they meet Hercules Mulligan, Marquis de Lafayette and John Laurens and join the American Revolution. 

Burr asks General George Washington to make him his secretary but instead, Washington hires Hamilton. Hamilton marries a woman named Eliza Schuyler while Burr falls in love with the wife of a British soldier. Charles Lee insults Washington so Laurens decides to duel Lee with Hamilton’s help and Washington punishes Hamilton by sending him home where Hamilton finds out his wife is pregnant. 

Lafayette convinces Washington to bring back Hamilton to help with the Battle of Yorktown. Hamilton’s wife gives birth to a son Philip Hamilton while Burr has a daughter Theodosia. Hamilton and Burr become lawyers. 

Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay wrote the Federalist Papers to convince people to get a new Constitution, and President Washington hired Hamilton to be in charge of spending money for the Government. 

Thomas Jefferson comes back from France and is angry with Hamilton for spending too much money. Hamilton then has sex with a married woman whose husband then blackmails him for money. Hamilton strikes a deal with Jefferson and James Madison that they get to choose the capital of the country if Hamilton can start his own bank.

Burr wishes he could be in the room where the deals are made so that he could know what happens inside it, so he joins the Democratic-Republican Party and becomes a politician. Jefferson tries to convince Washington to support France against England in their war but Hamilton convinces Washington not to do that so Jefferson quits his job working for Washington and decides to run for President of the United States while Washington decides to retire. 

After John Adams becomes president he and Hamilton don’t get along well so Hamilton quits and complains about Adams. Jefferson, Madison, and Burr think that Hamilton stole money from the government so Hamilton tells them the truth, that he spent his own money paying a man named Reyolds not to tell anyone that he had sex with Reynolds’s wife but Hamilton is scared that Burr will use this to blackmail him so Hamilton writes a letter in a newspaper telling everyone everything and his wife is angry with him about it. 

When a man gives a speech criticizing Hamilton, Hamilton’s son Philip is angry about it, so they have a duel. Philip fires his gun at the sky but the man shoots and kills him. Hamilton becomes upset about it, Eliza being angry at him, and questioning if he knew about the duel.

Then Burr runs for president and there’s a tie between him and Jefferson so each one asks Hamilton who he thinks would be a better president of the United States. Hamilton says he hates Jefferson and disagrees with him on everything but that he’s still better than Burr since Jefferson believes what he says he believes but Burr doesn’t believe in anything. 

Jefferson becomes president and doesn’t want Burr to be his vice president so Burr asks Hamilton for a duel. Instead of killing Burr, Hamilton fires his gun at the sky and Burr shoots Hamilton and kills him. Burr regrets his actions and his loved ones sing a song about how upsetting Hamilton dying is.

Window function

In mathematics, a window function is a special function that can be applied to a signal, as it occurs in digital signal processing. A window function has a value of zero outside the domain which is of interest, and a non-zero value inside this domain. When multiplied with the signal (function), the result will be zero outside the domain of interest, and non-zero inside it - it will only leave the "window". The simplest possible window function is rectangular: It is 1 inside the domain of interest, and zero everywhere else. It is named Dirichlet window (after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet). Many window functions are symmetric around the center (which is often in the middle of the interval). They will amplify or weaken the signal in certain positions,

The Hittite-Luwian city-state and historical region of the same name in the south-west of the Armenian Highlands(near modern town of Elbistan, Ablasta in Armenian: Աբլաստա), which existed in the Bronze Age and was mentioned by king Mursili II in his annals, where he writes that when Šuppiluliuma I was king of the Hittites, the Aravanians invaded the land of Kaskians near «Sammahi». Some translators believe that this may be a Late-Hittite pronunciation of «Samuha», comparing Šuppiluliuma of the mid-14th century BC, who managed to subdue Arawanna and other city-states, which had rebelled against his father, with king Šuppiluliuma of the late 13th century BC. However, in other places of the annals Arawanna and Cascia are not connected with Samuha. King Mursili himself in the fifth year of his reign - c. 1317 BC - moved to the city of Zulila in the vicinity of Sammahi to save the Cascians from invasions near Samuha.

Arawanna took part in the coalition of states that rebelled against the Hittite king Tudhaliya III and were supported by the king of Mitanni Shuttarna II.

Arawanna(I҆rwnt) was one of the allies states who fought on the side of the Hittite empire against Egypt at the Battle of Kadesh

Arawanna(I҆rwnt) was a homeland and personal land domain of the first historically known Armenian royal dynasty Eruandid(Yervanduni,Orontid dynasty).

Remembrance (1982 movie)

Remembrance is a drama about Royal Navy ratings of HMS "Raleigh". They are about to go on a six-month naval exercise. Some well-known British actors had early roles in the film. They include Timothy Spall, Lisa Maxwell and John Altman. It was Gary Oldman's first film.

It was made by Channel Four Films and was shown in the first week of Channel 4 broadcasting. It was also one of the first films in the UK to be shown on television less than three years after its initial cinema release. Before this event, a three-year delay was made by the Cinema Exhibitors' Association.

The film follows several naval ratings with the story switching between the characters. The naval ratings prepare for their coming months away at sea. The action takes place around the bars and clubs of the Union Street district of Plymouth. One major event that affects all the characters is the hospitalisation, and eventual death, of Daniel, played by Gary Oldman. This is after a violent assault by a nightclub bouncer.

Gregg got the idea for the film from his own experiences as a student at Plymouth Art College.
It was shot on location. It includes interior scenes in two Union Street pubs, "The Phoenix" and "The Two Trees".

The film was commissioned by Channel 4, before the channel had started broadcasting. It was shown in November 1982, close to Remembrance Sunday. This was in the first week of the new channel

In June 1982, before being shown on TV, the film had been shown in a cinema, the "Screen on the Hill" in Hampstead.
This was for publicity of the film and the start of Channel 4. It took advantage of the role that the Royal Navy had played in the Falklands War. It was also an important event in the relationship between cinema and television in the UK. In "Independent Television in Britain" (Volume 6, 2003), Paul Bonner and Lesley Aston note that:


Background music is from "Aragon" by Brian Eno.

Channel 4's regulator, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), raised concerns about use of swearing in the script.

The film won the Golden Charybdis Award at the 1982 Taormina International Film Festival.

Stilton cheese

Stilton is an English cheese, made in two types: Blue, and White. Blue stilton has "Penicillium roqueforti" added. This gives it a characteristic smell and taste. White is the same cheese without having the penicillium added. Both have been given the status of a protected designation of origin (PDO) by the European Commission. This means that the cheese must be made to a strict code in one of the three counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire or Nottinghamshire. 

Cheese made in the village of Stilton, which is now in Cambridgeshire can not be sold as "Stilton".

Frances Pawlett (or Paulet), a cheese maker of Wymondham, Leicestershire, has been credited as the person who set modern Stilton cheese's shape and style characteristics in the 1720s, 
but others have also been named. 
A recipe for a Stilton cheese was published in 1721 by Richard Bradley.

The Stilton Cheesemaker's Association say the first person to market Blue Stilton cheese was Cooper Thornhill. He was the owner of the Bell Inn on the Great North Road, in the village of Stilton, Huntingdonshire. Huntingdonshire is now a district in modern Cambridgeshire. The story is that in 1730, Thornhill discovered a distinctive blue cheese while visiting a small farm near Melton Mowbray in rural Leicestershire — possibly in Wymondham. He fell in love with the cheese and made a business arrangement that gave the Bell Inn exclusive marketing rights to Blue Stilton. The Great North Road, a main stagecoach route from London to Northern England, passed through the village of Stilton. So he was able to promote the sale of Stilton cheese.

In 1936 the Stilton Cheesemakers' Association (SCMA) was formed. They wanted to get legal protection for the quality and origin of the cheese. In 1966, Stilton was granted legal protection via a certification trade mark, the only British cheese to have received this status.

Blue Stilton's blue veins are created by piercing the crust of the cheese with stainless steel needles. This allows air into the core. The cheese is then ripened for nine to twelve weeks.

For cheese to use the name "Stilton", it must be made in one of the three counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire, and must use pasteurised local milk. The manufacturers of Stilton cheese in these counties applied for and received protection under European Law (PDO = protected designation of origin) in 1996.

Stichelton is made in the same way as Stilton cheese and uses cows' milk from Nottinghamshire, but the milk is unpasteurised and so under the PDO it cannot be designated as true Stilton.

Another Leicestershire dairy was located in the grounds of Quenby Hall near the village of Hungarton. There had been a dairy there in the 18th century. Quenby Hall restarted Stilton production in a new dairy in August 2005 but the business closed in 2011. 

The former Dairy Crest-owned licensed dairy that produced Stilton at Hartington in Derbyshire was acquired by the Long Clawson dairy in 2008 and closed in 2009, with production transferred to Leicestershire. Two former employees set up the Hartington Creamery at Pikehall in Hartington parish which was licensed in 2014.

Stilton cheese cannot be produced in the village that gave the cheese its name. Stilton village is not in the three permitted counties; it is in the historic county of Huntingdonshire in Cambridgeshire. The Original Cheese Company applied to Defra to amend the Stilton PDO to include the village but the application was rejected in 2013.

Stilton cheese was also manufactured in Staffordshire. The Nuttall family of Beeby, Leicestershire opened a Stilton cheese factory in Uttoxeter in 1892 to take advantage of the local milk and good transport links.

To be called "Blue Stilton", a cheese must:

Stilton has a typical fat content of approximately 35%, and protein content of approximately 23%.

A number of blue cheeses are made in a similar way to Blue Stilton. These cheeses get their blue veins and distinct flavour from the use of one or more saprotrophic fungi, such as "Penicillium roqueforti" and "Penicillium glaucum". Since the PDO came into effect, some British supermarkets have stocked a generic "British Blue cheese". Other makers have adopted their own names and styles. Other typical British blue cheeses are Oxford Blue and Shropshire Blue.

Many countries make blue cheeses. Italy has Gorgonzola cheese, a greenish-blue cheese made from cows' milk. France has Fourme d'Ambert made in Auvergne with cows' milk and Roquefort, made with ewes' milk. Denmark makes Danish Blue Cheese. The Netherlands makes Ruscello.

Blue Stilton is often eaten with celery or pears. It can also be added as a flavouring to vegetable soup, such as cream of celery or broccoli. 
It is often eaten with crackers, biscuits or bread. It can also be used to make a blue cheese sauce served over a steak. It can be crumbled over a salad. The cheese is traditionally eaten at Christmas. The edible rind of the cheese forms naturally during the aging process.

White Stilton is the same cheese but has not had the "Penicillium roqueforti" mould introduced into it. It is a crumbly, creamy, open textured cheese.

A 2005 survey by the British Cheese Board reported that Stilton seemed to cause unusual dreams, with 75% of men and 85% of women experiencing "odd and vivid" dreams after eating a 20-gram serving of the cheese half an hour prior to sleeping.

George Orwell wrote an essay, "In Defence of English Cooking", first published in the "Evening Standard" on 15 December 1945. While enumerating the high points of British cuisine, he touches on Stilton: "Then there are the English cheeses. There are not many of them, but I fancy that Stilton is the best cheese of its type in the world, with Wensleydale not far behind."

The Stilton Cheese Makers Association produced a fragrance called "Eau de Stilton", which was "very different to the very sweet perfumes you smell wafting down the street as someone walks past you."

The search for an unpasteurised Stilton cheese was a plot element of a "Chef!" episode titled "The Big Cheese", aired on BBC1 on 25 February 1993.

A character named G. D'Arcy "Stilton" Cheesewright appears in several of the Jeeves novels of P. G. Wodehouse.

War of Devolution

In the 1667 to 1668 War of (the) Devolution, France occupied the Spanish-controlled provinces of Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comté. Because of one law not many people knew about (called the Jus Devolutionis), Louis XIV claimed these provinces 'devolved' to him because of his marriage to Maria Theresa of Spain.

King Louis had claimed territory from the Spanish Empire as his own, due to his marriage of Maria Theresa. This claim started the conflict between France and the Spanish Empire. The Triple Alliance, (England, Sweden, and The Netherlands,) decided to get involved in this war, but not allying with either side. They saw 2 countries now weakened by war and realized they could expand. They also did this for the protection of each side, because both were a vital piece to trade in Europe and the world. The French soldiers marched into Flanders, (now in Belgium) and easily took over the city. Just a year later after almost a standoff, they made a peace treaty with Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I. They would partition the Spanish Dominions until the king's death, and France would annex part of the Netherlands.

Islam in Delhi

Delhi has the second largest Muslim population (12.86%) within Delhi State. Muhammad Ghori invaded India in 1175 A.D. After the conquest of Multan and Punjab, he advanced towards Delhi. The Rajput chiefs of northern India headed by Prithvi Raj Chauhan defeated him in the First Battle of Terrain in 1191 A.D. After about a year, Muhammad Ghori came again to avenge his defeat. A furious battle was fought again in Terrain in 1192 A.D. in which the Rajputs were defeated and Prithvi Raj Chauhan was captured and put to death. The Second Battle of Terrain, however, proved to be a decisive battle that laid the foundations of Muslim rule in Northern India. Ghori built many mosques and libraries after laying Muslim rule in India. The period between 1206 A.D. and 1526 A.D. in India's history is known as the Delhi Sultanate period. During this period of over three hundred years, five dynasties ruled in Delhi. These were: the Slave dynasty (1206-90), Khilji dynasty (1290-1320), Tughlaq dynasty (1320-1413), Sayyid dynasty (1414-51), and Lodhi dynasty (1451-1526).The Delhi Sultanate was an Islamic empire based in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the Indian subcontinent for 320 years (1206–1526). Five dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the Mamluk/Slave dynasty (1206–1290), the Khalji dynasty (1290–1320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1414), the Sayyid dynasty (1414–1451), and the Lodi dynasty (1451–1526). It covered large swathes of territory in modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh as well as some parts of southern Nepal.

As a successor to the Ghurid dynasty, the Delhi Sultanate was originally one among a number of principalities ruled by the Turkic slave-generals of Muhammad Ghori (who had conquered large parts of Northern India), including Yildiz, Aibek and Qubacha, that had inherited and divided the Ghurid territories amongst themselves. After a long period of infighting, the Mamluks were overthrown in the Khalji revolution which marked the transfer of power from the Turks to a heterogeneous Indo-Muslim nobility. Both of the resulting Khalji and Tughlaq dynasties respectively saw a new wave of rapid Muslim conquests deep into South India. The sultanate finally reached the peak of its geographical reach during the Tughlaq dynasty, occupying most of the Indian subcontinent. This was followed by decline due to Hindu reconquests, Hindu kingdoms such as the Vijayanagara Empire and Mewar asserting independence, and new Muslim sultanates such as the Bengal Sultanate breaking off. In 1526, the Sultanate was conquered and succeeded by the Mughal Empire.

The sultanate is noted for its integration of the Indian subcontinent into a global cosmopolitan culture (as seen concretely in the development of the Hindustani language and Indo-Islamic architecture), being one of the few powers to repel attacks by the Mongols (from the Chagatai Khanate) and for enthroning one of the few female rulers in Islamic history, Razia Sultana, who reigned from 1236 to 1240. Bakhtiyar Khalji's annexations were responsible for the large-scale desecration of Hindu and Buddhist temples (leading to the decline of Buddhism in East India and Bengal), and the destruction of universities and libraries. Mongolian raids on West and Central Asia set the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, intelligentsia, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from those regions into the subcontinent, thereby establishing Islamic culture in India and the rest of the region.

Muscular dystrophy

Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of muscle diseases that causes increasing weakening and breakdown of skeletal muscles over time. Many people will eventually become unable to walk. Some types are also associated with problems in other organs. 

The most common type is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which typically affects males beginning around the age of four. There is no cure for muscular dystrophy.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe type of muscular dystrophy. The symptom of muscle weakness usually begins around the age of four in boys and worsens quickly. Most are unable to walk by the age of 12. Scoliosis is also common.

The disorder is X-linked recessive. About two thirds of cases are inherited from a person's mother, while one third of cases are due to a new mutation. It is caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein dystrophin.

Although there is no known cure, physical therapy, braces, and corrective surgery may help with some symptoms.

Fossil water

Fossil water or palaeowater is an ancient body of water that has been kept in an undisturbed place. Usually it is groundwater in an aquifer. It may stay underground for millions of years. Other types of fossil water can include lakes under ice, such as Antarctica's Lake Vostok. The term may be used to describe ancient water on other planets.

UNESCO defines "fossil groundwater" as
"water that infiltrated usually millennia ago and often under climatic conditions different from the present, and that has been stored underground since that time".

Estimating the time since water infiltrated is done using isotopes. Some aquifers are hundreds of meters deep and underlie vast areas of land. Research techniques in the field are developing quickly and the scientific knowledge base is growing. For many aquifers, research is lacking or disputed as to the age of the water and the behaviour of the water inside the aquifer.

Nute Gunray

Nute Gunray is a fictional character in the Star Wars Universe. Gunray was a neimoidian politician who served as the Viceroy of the Trade Federation during their invasion of Naboo and later served as a prominent Separatist leader during the conflict known as the Clone Wars. Gunray appears in , and of the Star Wars Prequels Trilogy as well as in other media such as the Animated Television series.

The Invasion of Naboo was an event that took place 32 years before the events of . The Invasion began as a blockade around the planet, with Nute Gunray taking charge of the fleet, this blockade was set up in order to protest the taxation of trade routes by the new republic, however the real intention of the blockade was to stage a droid invasion of the planet so that Senator Palpatine (who was secretly controlling Nute Gunray as Darth Sidious) could gain sympathy in the Galactic Senate. After the Blockade was set up, the trade federation began sending Battle Droids down to the planets surface. This event was seen throughout .

The Republic sent Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi to negotiate with the Viceroy, Gunray assumed they had arrived to force a negotiation so, after consulting Darth Sidious, ordered their death. Droideka's were sent but the two Jedi were able to escape to the planet below were they witnesses the invasion first hand. Nute Gunray would later descend to the planet below of Naboo in an attempt to force the planet's queen Padmé Amidala into a deal, he would eventually be stopped.

Nute Gunray argues that everything he does is legal and he also states that he would not do anything without the approval of the senate, when saying this he is talking about the trade blockade, not the invasion. If proof could be shown to the senate that the trade federation had began an invasion of the planet, the republic would intervene, but the senate could not be convinced. Gunray and the trade federation had a presence in the senate and were even accused of taking part in bureaucracy.

Nute Gunray was under direct command of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. This was the Sith alias of Senator Palpatine. Sidious commanded Gunray to invade Naboo. By creating an artificial conflict, Sidious could gain sympathy for Naboo in the senate. He could use this sympathy along with the Republic's lack of action to achieve the political position of Supreme Chancellor. Nute Gunray was just a pawn in Sidious' plan to achieve the position of supreme chancellor. By working as the necessary opposition, Gunray was not aware that this was his purpose but despite this Sidious was able to ascend to Supreme Chancellor and he would not be able to do this without Nute Gunray.

Nute Gunray was not fond of his Sith overlords. When Darth Sidious introduced Darth Maul in a hologram to Gunray, Gunray was not pleased and when the communication ended exclaimed "This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!" referring to the two Sith. It is likely that Gunray disliked the Sith as he feared their power and they could threaten his position. Gunray also feared they could be too controlling.

Nute Gunray also knew the Sith Lord Darth Tyrannus was Sidious's second apprentice and played a large part in the separatist rebellion along with Gunray. They were seen together on Geonosis.

After the conflict on Naboo Nute Gunray along with others from the Trade Federation, Banking Clan, Techno Union and others form the Confederacy of Independent Systems (C.I.S.) the C.I.S. would be what fought against the Republic During the conflict known as The Clone Wars.

Gunray was the chairman of the separatist council and sat on it alongside others such as Count Dooku, the Corporate Alliance’s Passel Argente, the InterGalactic Banking Clan’s San Hill, the Commerce Guild’s Shu Mai, the Techno Union’s Wat Tambor, Poggle the Lesser of Geonosis, and Senators Po Nudo and Tikkes.

Nute Gunray was killed by Darth Vader under the orders of his new master Darth Sidious on Mustafar after Darth Sidious ordered the Separatist council move there as Sidious promised the war would soon be at an end.

"This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!"

"What about the Senator from Naboo? Is she dead yet? I am not signing your treaty until I have her head on my desk!"

"She can't do that! Shoot her, or something!"

"She has disappeared, my lord. One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade."

"And the Jedi?"

"My lord, it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range."

"Yes, of course. As you know, our blockade is perfectly legal and we'd be happy to receive the ambassadors."

"No need to report that to him until we have something to report!"

"My lord, is that, legal?"

"Ah, victory!"

"The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace. We only want..."

"Safe? Hum. Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape, General. Without Count Dooku, I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe."

Korean New Year

Korean New Year () is the first day of the Chinese lunisolar calendar.It is one of the most important traditional Korean holidays which orginated from China. The celebration usually lasts three days: the day before Korean New Year, Korean New Year itself, and the day after Korean New Year. During this time, many Koreans visit family, perform ancestral rites, wear "hanbok"(한복), eat traditional food, and play folk games. Additionally, children often receive money from their elders after performing a formal bow (originated from Chinese HongBao). Most celebrations can be dated back to ancient China because Korea was a dependent country of China. Therefore, a lot of celebrations were strongly correlated to the traditional Chinese culture.

Korean New Year generally occurs in January or February on the second new moon after the winter solstice, unless there is a intercalary eleventh or twelfth month in the lead-up to the New Year. In such a case, the New Year falls on the third new moon after the solstice. Korean New Year typically falls on the same day as Chinese New Year.

Phrygian cap

The Phrygian cap () or liberty cap is a soft cap, in the shape of a cone, with the apex bent over, which people in antiquity thought had to do with many different peoples in Eastern Europe and Anatolia, including Phrygia, Dacia, and the Balkans. During the French Revolution it came to mean freedom and the pursuit of liberty, but Phrygian caps did not originally have this meaning. The original cap of liberty was the Roman "pileus", the felt cap of freed slaves of ancient Rome, which also had to do with Libertas, the Roman goddess of liberty. In the 16th century, the Roman icons of liberty were used again in emblem books and coin studying handbooks where the figure of Libertas is usually shown with a "pileus". The most common use of a headgear as a symbol of freedom in the first two centuries after the Roman iconography was commonly used again was in the Netherlands, where the cap of liberty was used in the form of a hat of that time. In the 18th century, the traditional liberty cap was often used in English prints and from 1789 on in French prints, too; but it was not until the early 1790s, that the French cap of liberty was most often used in the Phrygian form.

It is used in the coats of arms of some republics in the place where in a monarchy a crown would be used. It thus came to be identified as a symbol of the republican form of government. A number of national personifications, most commonly France's Marianne, are usually depicted wearing the Phrygian cap.

Boolean expression

In computer science, a Boolean expression is an expression used in programming languages that produces either true or false when evaluated.
Boolean expressions are often used by conditionals in computer programs to decide which code to run.

Most Boolean expressions will contain at least one variable (), and often more () so that the expression can be useful for various values of X and Y.

Boolean operators may be represented by words such as
OR, AND and "NOT".

Some programming languages use symbols such as
"||" (double pipe character) for OR, "&&" (double ampersand) for AND, and "!" for NOT.
Other programming languages may use other symbols.

Other Boolean operators may be available, too, for example XOR (exclusive OR).

Boolean expressions can also be represented as Logic gates in electronic circuit diagrams.

See Truth tables for a summary of the effects of common Boolean operators.

Angels (TV series)

Angels is a British television seasonal drama series about student nurses. It was broadcast by the BBC between 1975 and 1983. It was described as the ""Z-Cars" of nursing".

From 1979 the show changed to a seasonal twice-weekly soap opera format.

The show's title came from the name of the hospital where the first series was set. This was St. Angela's in Battersea. In the 1980s this was changed to Heath Green Hospital in Birmingham. The series was devised by Paula Milne. Early producers included Morris Barry and Ron Craddock. The first episode was directed by Julia Smith. She became the show's producer in 1979. Her script editor on the later series was Tony Holland. Filming took place at St James' Hospital in Balham, London. This has since been demolished. Location filming for the fictional Heath Green Hospital took place at Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry. This has since been demolished and replaced by University Hospital Coventry.

Julia Smith enlisted Tony Holland as the "Angels" script editor after the show became a twice-weekly soap. In the 1980s Smith and Holland created "EastEnders". Writers on its first series included Jill Hyem, Anne Valery and Adele Rose. Hyem and Valery later co-wrote "Tenko".

The series included some young actors who would later become better known. These include Fiona Fullerton, Érin Geraghty, Lesley Dunlop, Julie Dawn Cole, Angela Bruce, Clare Clifford and Pauline Quirke. Additionally, Kathryn Apanowicz, Shirley Cheriton and Judith Jacob all later appeared in "EastEnders". Mamta Kaash played a key role in the hospital drama "Casualty".

The guitar-driven theme tune, similar to American police dramas of the time, was called "Motivation". It was composed and performed by Alan Parker.

"Angels", tackled issues such as contraception, alcoholism and promiscuity as part of the nurses' lives. "Angels" received criticism for its unglamorous depiction of the nursing profession. "Angels" tried to be realistic and authentic. Each actress was required to work on a real hospital ward to gain experience.

Some TV tie-in novels were published to coincide with the series.

On 18 March 2013 Simply Media released the Series 1 (fifteen episodes) of "Angels" on DVD. Series 2 was released in September 2014.

Second-wave feminism

Second-wave feminism started in the 1960s in the United States. It lasted for roughly two decades. During first-wave feminism, women wanted to get the right to vote in elections and to be treated equally to men when it comes to owning and inheriting property. Second-wave feminism focused more on issues of sexuality (sex education, contraception, abortion, family planning) and violence directed against women (domestic violence, rape, and women's shelters). In many countries, there were also changes to the laws about divorce. 

It was a reaction to women returning to their roles as housewives and mothers after the end of the Second World War. The men that had to leave the workforce to join the defence forces had returned and women were fired from their positions and replaced by men. This movement was initially concentrated in the United States of America and then spread to other Western countries. This movement was triggered by the publishing of Betty Friedan’s book, "The Feminine Mystique", a renowned feminist text credited for daring to break social conventions about the portrayal of women. Friedan was inspired by Simone de Beauvoir’s book, "The Second Sex", first published in Paris in 1949. 

In the 1980s, there were disputes among different feminist groups (known as feminist sex wars), over issues of sexuality and pornography. These disputes started the "third-wave feminism" in the early 1990s.

Monarchy of Ireland

Ireland is mostly the Republic of Ireland (which does not have a monarchy) and partly Northern Ireland (whose monarch is Charles III). Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a constitutional monarchy. Until the 20th century, all Ireland had a constitutional monarchy and was a part of the United Kingdom since 1801. Monarchies were in existence through most of the history of Ireland.

In the High Middle Ages, the Gaelic kingdoms of Ireland ended when the Normans invaded Ireland. Ireland became a fief of the Papal States (the government of the Pope). The King of England's government started to control many of the lands of Ireland. This continued until the English Reformation, when the Kingdom of England got full ownership of Ireland. The Kingdom of Ireland came into existence in the reign of Henry VIII. Henry VIII was the first to be both King of England and King of Ireland.

The Kingdom of Ireland started in 1542. Before 1603, Ireland shared a monarch with the Kingdom of England (but not with the Kingdom of Scotland) in a personal union. When Henry VIII's daughter Elizabeth I died in 1603, James VI and I became the first to be King of Ireland, King of England, and King of Scotland in a three-kingdom personal union. Between 1603 and 1707, the Kingdom of Ireland shared the monarchs of the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England. Anne was the Queen of Ireland when the United Kingdom of Great Britain came into existence in 1707. Anne was Queen of Ireland and Queen of Great Britain. Between 1707 and 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland shared the British monarchy with the United Kingdom of Great Britain. (During the government of Oliver Cromwell, the British Isles became a republic: the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland.) George III was King of Ireland when the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland came into existence at the start of 1801. George III was the first to be king of the new kingdom, which combined the whole British Isles (except the Isle of Man) into one kingdom for the first time.

In December 1922, most of Ireland left the United Kingdom to become part of the Irish Free State, a dominion within the British Empire; the rest, Northern Ireland, remained within the United Kingdom. In 1937, after George V died, the Free State changed its laws to give the British monarchs much less power. In April 1949, the Republic of Ireland stopped having a monarchy entirely, and left the Commonwealth of Nations. Since then, the only part of Ireland to have a monarchy is Northern Ireland (because it is part of the United Kingdom). Elizabeth II was the former queen, but passed in 2022. Charles, Prince of Wales was named the King of England in September 2022.

Lawrence v. Texas

Lawrence v. Texas, 539 US 558 (2003), is the primary piece of case law which ultimately decriminalized sodomy in the United States. Ruled upon by the United States Supreme Court in 2003, "Lawrence v. Texas" concerned a Texas law that criminalized consensual, adult homosexual intercourse which was found unconstitutional under the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Houston Police were tipped off to a weapons disturbance purportedly from the residence of John Lawrence. Upon entering the apartment, police found Lawrence and Tyron Garner engaging in sexual intercourse. At the time, a statute was in place which banned such homosexual sex acts and further deemed homosexuality a "deviance." Both Lawrence and Garner were arrested and convicted under this statute.

Upon appeal, the Texas State Court of Appeals affirmed the men's convictions citing "Bowers v. Hardwick", 478 US 186 (1986), as the controlling case.

Lawrence filed for certiorari to the Supreme Court which was granted in 2003.

In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court voted to overturn Lawrence's conviction and declared the Texas anti-sodomy statute unconstitutional. The decision hinged on the right of Lawrence and Garner to engage in private conduct under the Due Process Clause. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing the majority opinion, stated "[Lawrence and Garner's] right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government." The decision to overturn "Bowers v. Hardwick" was 5-4, with Justice O'Connor (a member of the "Bowers" majority back in 1986) refusing to overturn "Bowers" and instead supporting the "Lawrence" ruling on narrower Equal Protection grounds because the challenged Texas law made male-male sodomy illegal but not male-female sodomy.

In a 2004 law review article, U.S. law professors Nelson Lund and John McGinnis criticized "Lawrence v. Texas" due to its alleged judicial hubris and expressed fears that its extremely broad language could have unexpected consequences in the long(er)-run.

Mafia (party game)

Mafia is a hidden role game made by Dmitry Davidoff in 1986. It is also called Werewolf. The game is usually between two teams. There is an evil team that less players belong to. This group knows who is good and who is evil. They have to hide that they are evil from the good team. There is the good team, called the village, that has most of the players. People in this team have to find out who is good and bad. Everyone is given their role at the beginning of the game by a person who is not playing, called a moderator. The game has two stages, day and night. At night, everyone closes their eyes. The moderator tells the evil team to open their eyes. They choose someone to kill or remove from the game. Some other roles on both teams can do things at night. In the day, everyone opens their eyes. The players that are still alive will talk to each other about everyone's roles. They also each choose someone to kill, and the person that the most people choose will be killed. The game keeps going until only the members from one team are left.

Dmitry Davidoff (, "Dmitry Davydov") is usually said to have made the game. He says he first made the game in Spring 1987 at the Psychology department of Moscow State University. He made it to do psychology research and his job of teaching high school students. It got popular in other Soviet colleges and school in the 1990s. It also started to be played in some parts of Europe and the United States.

Andrew Plotkin made a werewolf theme for the mafia rules in 1997. He said that mafia was not that big of a cultural reference. He also said that werewolves made sense in the rules. Werewolves are bad creatures that hide in the day. Many science fiction writer groups and people at tech events started playing mafia.

A person with the username "mithrandir" ran a game of werewolf on the website The Grey Labyrinth's forum in August 2000. The Grey Labyrinth is a website about solving puzzles. The website says that this was the first werewolf game that was played on a forum.

Some parents in Rockingham complained to a school there. They were scared of bad effects that the game could have on their kids. Davidoff said that the game could "teach kids to distinguish right from wrong." He also said that the good lesson of being honest was stronger than the scariness of the game.

About.com said that Werewolf one of the 50 most important games since 1890.

Simpler games have players put into two teams. This is the evil team and the good team. The evil team is called the werewolves. The good team is called the village. Games will need someone who is not playing. This person is called the moderator. Everyone will get a card before the game starts. This card will give them a role. Each role is part of a team. The role might also have powers. These powers can do many things. An example is finding out a player's team.

The game has two stages. These are night and day. At night the werewolves open their eyes. They silently choose who to kill. At day all players vote on someone to lynch. The village also finds out who was killed at night.

Nuthatch

The nuthatches are a part of Sitta, a genus of small passerine birds in the family Sittidae. They live in the Northern Hemisphere.

They have large heads, short tails, and powerful bills and feet. Nuthatches advertise their territory with loud, simple songs. Most species have grey or bluish upperparts and a black eye stripe.
They live in forests, often pine coniferous forests, on higher land (montane forests). As usual in such places, insects, nuts and seeds are their food. Unlike other birds, nuthatches can run down trees head-first, and hang upside down. They can run down trees as fast as they climb up them.

Nuthatches use holes in trees for nests. This also means they compete with squirrels and woodpeckers for these holes. In fact both squirrels and the great spotted woodpecker kill nuthatches if they can. Owls and hawks also kill these small birds, but that is not to do with their nest-holes. In defense of their nests, nuthatches make the entrances smaller by packing the edges with mud or tree resin. Predation is not really a threat, just a fact of life for them. Loss of coniferous forest in some countries is a threat, as they cannot live in anything else except in trees.

All nuthatches store food, especially seeds. They hide seeds in tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, or behind bark flakes. These stores are remembered for as long as 30 days.

Most nuthatches do not migrate. They stay in the forest through the winter, where they roost in large flocks. These flocks can have over 100 nuthatches. Sometimes they include other forest birds, such as tits and woodpeckers.

Volumetric pipette

A volumetric pipette is a kind of pipette which allows you to find the volume of a solution very accurately. It is also known as a bulb pipette or a belly pipette.

Usage

This kind of pipette has a large bulb on the top end, with a long narrow tube on the other end. It is used to accurately measure small amounts of liquids. You use it by placing the long, narrow end in the desired liquid, then squeeze the top end, the part with the bulb. Pipettes function on suction, sort of like sucking the air out of a water bottle. It gets harder and harder to suck the air out of the water bottle as the inside gets closer to a perfect vacuum. When the apparatus is removed, a small "sucking" sound may be audible. This is the air again reaching equilibrium with the outside air, as outside air rushes in. The same thing goes for a pipette. When you press down on the flexible bulb-like part of the pipette, you create an absence of air in the pipette. When you remove the pressure, the long part of the pipette sucks in the liquid that the end of the pipette is immersed in. A volumetric pipette uses measurements to suck up the exact amount needed of the liquid it is immersed in.

Philo of Alexandria

Philo Judaeus, also known as Philo of Alexandria, was a Jewish philosopher who lived from c. 20 BC to c. 50 AD. Philo wanted to prove that the Torah and Greek philosophy actually agreed with each other and he used allegory to do that. In 38 AD, Philo was one of many Egyptian Jews to meet with the Roman Emperor Caligula and he wrote a book about it.

Either Philo’s father or his father’s father was a Jew who became a Roman citizen based on a decision of the dictator Julius Caesar. Philo went to the Second Temple of Jerusalem at least once. Philo lived at the same time as Jesus did.

When Philo was living in Alexandria the Jews were treated badly by the Greeks. According to Philo’s book Against Flaccus, Egypt’s Roman ruler Aulis Avilius Flaccus persecuted the Jews because the Jews refused to worship Caligula as a god. Philo wrote his book Against Flaccus attacking him for doing that. Philo was one of many Jews who went to Rome to convince Caligula not to build a giant statue of himself as the god Jupiter and put it inside the Second Temple of Jerusalem because if Caligula did that the Jews would rebel against him. Philo wrote a book describing his mission to Caligula called Legatio ad Gaium (The Embassy to Gaius) because Gaius was Caligula’s real name.

According to the Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus, born Yosef ben Matityahu, in his book The Antiquities of the Jews, Philo was the brother of the Roman-appointed Jewish tax collector Alexander. In Josephus’s version, the Jews refused to worship Caligula even though he commanded them to and Philo believed the Jews were right and that to worship Caligula would be a sin against God. A Roman named Apion came to Alexandria to convince the Jews that they were traitors to the Emperor and that Caligula would punish them but Philo convinced them that “ they should be of good courage, since Gaius’s words indeed showed anger at them but in reality had already set God against himself”. According to Josephus, the Jews of Alexandria chose Philo to represent them to Caligula and Philo said yes because he wanted to end the violence of the Greeks against the Jews.

Quaestiones(Latin for the Inquiries) is a series of books by Philo explaining the Torah, verse by verse with the first four books being about Genesis and the last two about Exodus.

Allegorical Commentary- a book by Philo about hidden meaning in the Book of Genesis.

Exposition of the Law, a classification of all the general topics in the Torah written for both Jews and Gentiles.

On the Life of Moses, a biography of Moses meant to show Moses as a philosopher.

On the Jews, a defence of the religion of Judaism.

On the Contemplative Life, a book by Philo arguing that not only does Greek philosophy not disagree with Judaism it was created by Judaism.

Against Flaccus, a book by Philo attacking Flaccus for his persecution of Egyptian Jews.

The Embassy to Gaius, an eyewitness account of the mission to Caligula.

Every Good Man is Free, about moral philosophy.

On the Eternity of the World, about Metaphysics.

On Animals, about Animals

On Providence, about God.

Philo tries to prove that the teachings of Plato and of Moses actually work well together. He also thinks to be a good person, you have to control your emotions.

Philo believed that all truth was in the Hebrew Bible and that everything in the Torah came from God. Philo believed that all philosophy comes from the Torah and even Greek philosophers got their ideas from there. Philo also said that every person in the Hebrew Bible actually represented a human quality. Adam represents mind, Eve represents the senses and Noah represents (“tranquility”) .

Philo believed that God does not have a body or emotions. Philo says that no one really knows anything for sure except that God exists. Based on Plato, Philo argued that everything that exists has always existed as an idea in the mind of God. 
Because of his mission to Caligula people know that Philo was involved in politics but not what his political beliefs actually were. Philo did write that someone who told a tyrant what he really thought about him put not only his own life in danger but also the lives of his wife and children and that one should therefore not do that except if doing that were likely to work.

For years, Philo was an influence on Christians like Eusebius and Jerome but was ignored by Jewish scholars. Then in 1575, an Italian Rabbi named Azariah die Rossi wrote a book in which he criticized Philo for reading the Torah in Greek instead of Hebrew, for believing that God created the Universe from matter that had always existed instead of believing that He created the Universe out of nothing, for relying too much on allegory in his approach to the Hebrew Bible and for not consulting
Jewish tradition. Rossi then tries to defend Philo and decides that he can’t be sure if Philo’s work is compatible with Judaism or not.

Elizabethan era

The Elizabethan era was a time in the history of England. It is generally seen as the time period of the reign of Elizabeth I, from 1558 to 1603. It is also the time of Renaissance architecture in England. During that time, the economy prospered. Even though it happened during a time when there was a conflict between Catholics and Protestants in England, Elizabeth could keep these problems from spreading.

The Elizabethan era had several notable features:

Golden Age of English Literature: It was a time of great literary achievements, with renowned playwrights like William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe producing some of their most famous works. Cultural Renaissance: The era witnessed a flourishing of arts, music, and literature, with a renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman works. Exploration and Colonization: Elizabethan England saw a surge in maritime exploration and the establishment of colonies, most notably in North America. Monarchical Power: Queen Elizabeth I wielded significant authority and was admired for her strong leadership, which contributed to political stability and national pride. Fashion and Style: The Elizabethan era is known for its distinctive clothing and elaborate fashion trends, with ruffled collars, corsets, and richly embroidered garments. Theatre and Entertainment: Theatre became a popular form of entertainment, with the construction of famous theatres like the Globe, where plays were performed to enthusiastic audiences. Scientific Progress: The era marked advancements in fields such as astronomy, medicine, and navigation, with notable figures like Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh making significant contributions.

William Shakespeare's works held immense importance in the Elizabethan era as they reflected and shaped the cultural, political, and social landscape of the time. His plays, such as "Hamlet" and "Macbeth," explored complex human emotions and societal issues, offering a mirror to the challenges and values of Elizabethan society. Additionally, his influence on the English language contributed significantly to its development, leaving an enduring impact on literature and drama. 

Furthermore, Shakespeare's plays were not only a form of entertainment but also served as a powerful tool for political commentary. The themes of power, ambition, and the consequences of unchecked authority in plays like "Julius Caesar" resonated with the political struggles of the Elizabethan court. His portrayal of characters navigating treacherous political landscapes offered the audience a reflection of their own societal tensions.

Moreover, Shakespeare's contribution to the elevation of the English language cannot be overstated. Through his mastery of language and poetry, he played a pivotal role in standardizing and enriching the English vocabulary. Many commonly used phrases and expressions today find their origins in Shakespeare's eloquent verses, showcasing his enduring linguistic impact on the development of the English language.

It almost became extinct in the early 20th century because of long-haired breeds being more popular. The Maine Coon became more popular in the 1970s. It is now one of the most popular cat breeds in the USA.

The Maine Coon is a large and friendly cat. This is how it got its nickname, "the gentle giant". It is known for having a big ruff along its chest, robust bone structure, rectangular body shape, an uneven two layered coat, and a long, bushy tail. The breed can be many different colors. If a Maine Coon is chocolate or lilac colored, it could be a crossbreed. People often say the Maine Coon is similar to dogs. Because the cat is so big, professionals have seen certain health problems that Maine Coons get. Some of these are feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hip dysplasia. Many breeders do things to make these problems happen less.

Croatian checkerboard

The Croatian checkerboard or chequy (Croatian: "šahovnica" ) is the national symbol of Croatia. It is the main shield of the Croatian coat of arms. On top of the main shield is the crown with five smaller shields, each representing a region of Croatia. The squares in the "šahovnica" are always arranged the right way, colored red and white. Historically, the order varied.

There is a legend, probably from the 19th century, which talks about how the Croatian king Držislav, captured by the Venetians, played a chess match. His opponent was Doge Pietro II Orseolo. He won and became free, and in some versions of the story he also got power over the Dalmatian cities. Then he put the chessboard in his coat of arms.

It first came into use in Croatian coat of arms around year 1495, as depicted on a temple hall located in Innsbruck, Austria. There is likelyhood that it has been borrowed by the House of Habsburg (who ruled the Hungarian-Croatian throne at the time) from other West Slavic coats of arms, as the silver-red colored pattern was popular among the 12–14th century Polish and Czech noble families. The cheque pattern in European heraldry was likely inspired by the board game of chess.

It is considered as the national symbol of Croatia, and is prominently displayed at sporting events. As such, the pattern in these colors remains associated mostly with the nation of Croatia.

First impeachment trial of Donald Trump

The first impeachment trial of President Donald Trump in the United States Senate began on January 16, 2020, and ended on February 5, 2020. 

It took place following President Trump's impeachment by the U.S. House of Representatives on December 18, 2019, after a two-month inquiry stage which lasted from September to November 2019. The House passed two articles of impeachment which charged him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. If Trump had been found guilty, he would have been removed from the presidency. On February 5, the Senate voted to acquit President Donald Trump (decide that he was not guilty), for both charges.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate after the House approved it. Senator Lindsey Graham proposed that he and Senator Mitch McConnell "change the rules of the Senate so we could start the trial without [Pelosi], if necessary".

On January 9, 2020, Pelosi said she would deliver the articles soon, but continued to cite a need for Republican transparency in the Senate; the same day, McConnell informed members of his caucus that he expected the trial to begin next week, and Senator Josh Hawley announced that McConnell had signed on as a co-sponsor to his resolution to dismiss articles of impeachment not sent to the Senate within 25 days. 

On January 10, Pelosi announced that she had "asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to be prepared to bring to the Floor next week a resolution to appoint managers and transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate".

At the end of the January 21 session, the Senate voted along party lines to pass Mitch McConnell's proposed trial rules and reject 11 amendments proposed by Democrats. The prosecution's opening arguments and presentation of evidence took place between January 22–24. Trump's defense presentation began on January 25. The primary arguments were a lack of direct evidence of wrongdoing, and that Democrats were attempting to use the impeachment to steal the 2020 election. Under the U.S. Constitution, a two-thirds majority of the Senate is required to convict the president.

The only mention of the chief justice in the entire constitution is that he is the presiding officer in the impeachment trial of the president. Under senate rules adopted in 1998, he also exercises this function in the trial of a vice president.

The White House has formally announced its Senate trial counsel as being led by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and Jay Sekulow, alongside Ken Starr, Alan Dershowitz, Pam Bondi, Jane Raskin, Eric Herschmann, and Robert Ray. Additionally, Michael Purpura and Patrick Philbin will participate in the trial.

On January 20, the White House named eight House Republicans to serve on Trump's defense team: Doug Collins, Mike Johnson, Jim Jordan, Debbie Lesko, Mark Meadows, John Ratcliffe, Elise Stefanik, and Lee Zeldin.

There were many witnesses who wished to testify before the Senate. The Senate voted on whether or not to allow witnesses to testify. Fifty-one votes were required to allow witnesses. There were 47 Democrats* and 53 Republicans in the Senate. All the Democrats* voted to allow witnesses to testify. Of the Republicans, Mitt Romney from Utah and Susan Collins of Maine voted to allow witnesses. This did not meet the required number of votes, and so no witnesses were allowed to testify.

On February 5, 2020 the Senate acquitted Trump on both charges. The votes were 52-48 to acquit on the first count and 53-47 to acquit on the second count. All Democrats, both independents, and only one Republican, Mitt Romney, voted to convict. The remaining Republicans all voted to acquit.

Holby City

Holby City (styled as HOLBY CIY) is a British medical drama television series shown weekly on BBC One. The series was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama "Casualty". It was first shown on 12 January 1999; the show ran until 29 March 2022. It is set in the same hospital as "Casualty" in the fictional city of Holby. Some episodes have characters and plots shared with "Casualty". There have been episodes broadcast as "Casualty@Holby City". Some episodes have characters and plots shared with the show's 2007 police procedural spin-off "HolbyBlue".

"Holby City" is shown once a week, all year round. Each series now contains 52 episodes.

The show follows the lives of medical and ancillary staff at the fictional Holby City Hospital.

As of January 2020, twenty-one series of "Holby City" have been shown. It is made at the BBC Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire. It has featured episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, "Holby City" moved to high definition broadcasting.

The series uses a team of researchers to ensure medical accuracy. Surgeons check the scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures. They spend time on hospital wards for research. 

"Holby City" has been nominated for over 100 television awards. It has won ten awards. The 2008 British Academy Television Award for Best Continuing Drama, one Black Entertainment Film Fashion Television and Arts (BEFFTA) award, two Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards, two Music Video and Screen Awards, and four Screen Nation awards. 

The first series averaged 9.27 million viewers. The eleventh series averaged 5.44 million viewers. Later series have had over 4 million viewers per week.

The first series had eleven main characters. All have since left the show. New main characters have been written in and out of the series. There are fifteen main characters. Well known actors regularly appear. Cast members have included Patsy Kensit, Jane Asher, Robert Powell, Ade Edmondson, John Michie, Al Hunter Ashton, Alex Walkinshaw and Jemma Redgrave.

In September 2016 the BBC said the show would be put up for tender. 
The tender document said the contract would be open to independent producers and BBC Studios. It would be for three series of at least 50 episodes each. It would be delivered from December 2017 with no break in transmission. It would be produced at BBC Elstree Centre. 
BBC Studios was the winning bidder and will continue to produce the show to 2020.

"Holby City" was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama "Casualty". It is set in the fictional Holby City Hospital. 
Young wanted to explore what happened to patients treated in "Casualty" once they were taken to the hospital's surgical wards. 
The stories on "Casualty" are limited to the "accident of the week". "Holby City" has stories about long-term care, rather than immediate life and death decisions. 

The series was commissioned by BBC One Controller Peter Salmon. It was first shown on BBC One on 12 January 1999.

Since its beginning, it has expanded to cover other wards. These include a gynaecology ward, an acute assessment unit and a maternity ward. 
Young explained that new wards are necessary to allow the crew to rotate sets.

Episodes of "Holby City" cost around £370,000 to produce. This is more than the BBC soap opera "EastEnders" which costs £130,000 per episode. "Casualty" costs £450,000 per episode. As "Holby City" is a high-volume, year-round production, it has relatively low production costs. Set-up costs can be spread over many years. Sets can be re-used. This is not the case for shorter series or one-off dramas.

Former "Casualty" producer Johnathan Young was an executive producer of "Holby" first series. 
Mal Young was executive producer of "Holby City" until 2004. 
Kathleen Hutchison worked with Mal Young as co-executive producer from 2003 to 2004. She left the series to become executive producer of "EastEnders". 

In March 2011, Johnathan Young returned to the BBC as executive producer of both "Casualty" and "Holby City".

"Holby City" storylines are planned eight months in advance. The series has a number of scriptwriters. They are found and scheduled by script development editor Simon Harper. 
Harper finds some writers through the BBC Writers Academy. This is a course which gives its graduates the chance to work on prime time television. McHale teaches at the academy, and graduate Abi Bown went on to become a regular writer for "Holby City". 
Harper also recruits writers through the BBC's Continuing Drama Shadow Scheme. 

McHale wrote the series' first episode, and served as the show's lead writer. 
His 2006 promotion to executive producer was part Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke's plan to "put writers back at the heart of the process". Yorke said McHale's promotion was "fantastic. It means that for the first time you've got a writer running one of our big powerhouse BBC1 shows." 

After McHale resigned the lead writer was Justin Young. He wants a more writer-led process from series 13 onwards. Writers will create more of the story of their episodes than before.

The serial employs a team of researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics. One medical advisor was given a cameo appearance in the series as an orthopaedic surgeon. Another advisor, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in "Holby City" as a scrub nurse. 
The programme uses different types os surgeons to check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is important as viewers might copy what they see in the show, such as CPR. 

Actor Amanda Mealing said: "We pride ourselves on being realistic. You need to know what you are doing and why. It is a complex and foreign thing to act out an operation. For training, I watched a number of real ones." 
Cast members are taught how to give injections, monitor blood pressure and check a pulse, and some watch procedures in hospitals. 
Original cast member George Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital in preparation for his role as Anton Meyer. Edward MacLiam observed laparoscopic surgery being performed before joining the cast as Greg Douglas in series twelve.

"Holby City" and "Casualty" are both set in Holby City Hospital. This is in the fictional county of Wyvern in the southwest of England close to the Welsh border. 
Bristol is used for city exteriors. Interior filming of "Holby City" is at BBC Elstree Centre in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire.

The "Casualty" set in Bristol was not large enough for the surgical ward and operating theatre needed for "Holby City". So some scenes in the first episode had to be shot twice, first on the "Casualty" set and then again at Elstree, with cast members travelling between the two locations. 

In October 2007, "The Daily Telegraph" reported that the Elstree site would be sold, and "Holby City" moved to share a set with "Casualty", possibly in Cardiff. 
In March 2009, the BBC said that "Casualty" would move to a new set in Cardiff. In April 2009, "The Guardian" said that the BBC would retain Elstree Studios for at least another four years.

Some episodes have been shot on location abroad. In 2004, the romance between nurse Jess Griffin (Verona Joseph) and anaesthetist Zubin Khan (Art Malik) had an episode set in Paris. 
In 2005, registrar Diane Lloyd (Patricia Potter) followed consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) to Ghana. This was part of the BBC's "Africa lives" series, a week of programmes bringing African culture to UK audiences. 
In 2006, an episode in Switzerland had consultant Elliot Hope's (Paul Bradley) wife Gina (Gillian Bevan) committing assisted suicide after her motor neurone disease worsened. 
A 2007 episode in Dubai focused on "Holby" registrar Joseph Byrne (Luke Roberts) meeting new nurse Faye Morton (Patsy Kensit).
In 2008, Joseph and consultant Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow) travelled to Cape Town. 
In November 2008, series producer Diana Kyle said that they would not be filming abroad again for the "foreseeable future". 
On 10 December 2012, it was announced that the show had filmed one episode in Stockholm. This focussed on Jac tracking down hospital CEO Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry).

"Holby City" is shot using the single-camera setup. 
Filming occurs from 8 am until 6 pm daily, 50 weeks a year. 
From July 2007 onwards, the show took on the filmising technique, giving the impression of having been shot on film. 
On 28 May 2010, the BBC announced that "Holby City" would move to HD by the end of the year. 
The series moved to HD broadcasting, with a BBC HD simulcast, from the start of series 13 in October 2010.

From the eleventh series a musical montage segment was included in each episode. This was introduced by McHale to modernise the show. This use of songtages was first popularised by the US medical drama "Grey's Anatomy". McHale stated he was unaware of this until after "Holby City" had used the technique. 
Music is selected by each episode's scriptwriter. Sometimes the producers and director would select the music in post-production. Actors have had some input: Hugh Quarshie selected the music he believed his character Ric Griffin would listen to in theatre. Asked in June 2010 whether she felt songtages were appropriate for a serious drama show, Kyle said: "they are an excellent way of telling stories visually".

"Holby City" was first shown on 12 January 1999 on BBC One. 
The show's first series ran for nine episodes. 

In June 2000, then Director-General of the BBC Greg Dyke pledged extra funding for BBC One, some of which was used for extra episodes of "Holby City". 
The second series ran for 16 episodes.
The third series ran for 30 episodes.
Episodes were shown weekly from the fourth series onwards. 
Series four to nine ran for 52 episodes. Series ten ran for 53 episodes, including the stand-alone finale episode "Mad World", set outside the hospital. Series eleven ran for 52 episodes. Series twelve had 55 episodes.
All series from then on had 52 episodes. The series reached its 500th episode on 13 April 2010.

In the first series episodes were 50 minutes long. From the second series episodes have been one hour. 
The first series was shown on Tuesday nights at 8.10 pm. The second series moved to Thursdays. Halfway through the third series in 2001, Holby moved back to Tuesday night at 8.05 pm. It then moved into the 8pm timeslot, where it has remained. The show is occasionally shown on a different day. 
In 2007, the show moved to Thursday nights to allow HolbyBlue to be shown in the 8pm Tuesday timeslot. BBC One Scotland has often shown the series at a later time.

In February 2019, it was announced that repeats of "Holby City" would begin on the channel Drama. This would begin with the first series.

In Finland it is shown on the channel Yle TV2 and is called "Holby Cityn sairaala".

Series twenty-two started on 7 January 2020.

"Holby City" follows the professional and personal lives of medical and ancillary staff at Holby General. It has an ensemble cast of main and recurring characters. The show has 10 to 20 main characters.

The original cast of 11 characters featured in the show's first episode was consultants Anton Meyer (George Irving) and Muriel McKendrick (Phyllis Logan), registrars Nick Jordan (Michael French) and Kirstie Collins (Dawn McDaniel), senior house officer Victoria Merrick (Lisa Faulkner), ward sister Karen Newburn (Sarah Preston), theatre sister Ellie Sharpe (Julie Saunders), senior staff nurse Ray Sykes (Ian Curtis), staff nurses Julie Bradford (Nicola Stephenson) and Jasmine Hopkins (Angela Griffin), and ward clerk Paul Ripley (Luke Mably).

For the first series, Young selected actors who were already established and had a soap opera background. Young had previously worked on the soap operas "Brookside" and "Family Affairs" 
French had starred in the BBC's "EastEnders", while Stephenson and Faulkner had starred in "Brookside". Griffin had also appeared in ITV's "Coronation Street". Hiring of established actors continued as the soap progressed, with former "Brookside" actress Patricia Potter cast as registrar Diane Lloyd, "Star Wars" actor Denis Lawson cast as consultant Tom Campbell-Gore, and "Family Affairs" star Rocky Marshall cast as SHO Ed Keating. Later, roles were given to comedian Adrian Edmondson, film actress Patsy Kensit, and "Jesus of Nazareth" star Powell. 

There is a casting department at Elstree Studios which casts actors for "Holby City" as well as "Casualty", "EastEnders" and "Doctors". The programme also has two casting directors who bring in actors for the producer and director to audition. Some cast members who play main characters have made previous appearances in minor "Holby City" roles. 

Current characters include acting chief executive officer and consultant neurosurgeon Max McGerry (Jo Martin), consultant general surgeon and medical director Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie), consultant cardiothoracic surgeons lead Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) and Kian Madani (Ramin Karimloo), consultant general surgeons Ben Sherwood (Charlie Condou), Ange Godard (Dawn Steele), Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett), and Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell), speciality registrars Dominic Copeland (David Ames), Xavier Duval (Marcus Griffiths), and Chloe Godard (Amy Lennox), foundation training doctors Nicky McKendrick (Belinda Owusu) and Cameron Dunn (Nic Jackman), director of nursing Adrian "Fletch" Fletcher (Alex Walkinshaw), and senior staff nurses Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs) and Essie Harrison (Kaye Wragg).

"Holby City" has had a number of famous guest stars.

In the first few series:

In the fiftieth episode

Other notable guest stars include

In 2003, the BBC reached an agreement with the actors' union Equity to cease offering walk-on drama series roles to members of the public as prizes. When an untrained person won such a role in "Holby City" in a competition, Equity complained to the broadcaster that such prizes were "demeaning" to actors, depriving them of paid employment. The competition winner was allowed to visit the "Holby City" set, but did not appear on-screen as a result of the policy change.

The BBC has shown occasional crossover mini-dramas entitled "Casualty@Holby City". It has a number of characters from each of the two casts. 
Before "Casualty@Holby City", the two shows had occasionally crossed-over storylines and cast members before. For example developing a romance between "Holby City" Ben Saunders (David Paisley) and "Casualty" Tony Vincent (Lee Warburton). 
The first full crossover was made by "Casualty" executive producer Mervyn Watson, and "Holby City" McHale. Work on both shows had to be halted for two weeks to release cast members to appear in the special.

A second crossover was commissioned in 2005 as part of the BBC's DoNation season. This aimed to raise public awareness of organ donation and to decide to sign up to the Organ Donor Register. An interactive episode of "Casualty@Holby City" was one of the headlining shows of the season, allowing viewers to vote by phone to determine the outcome of a fictional organ donation. 

The third "Casualty@Holby City" crossover aired in October 2005. The four-part storyline tackled the issue of youth violence, following the events of a turbulent A&E demonstration at an inner-city school. 

Another crossover was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing.

In February 2010, another crossover occurred when "Casualty" Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) was operated on by "Holby City" Elliot Hope after suffering a heart attack. The storyline was shown as "Casualty" and "Holby City" episodes, rather than under the "Casualty@Holby City" title. 
"Casualty" series producer Oliver Kent commented that, while it is "fantastic" to be able to produce crossover episodes, they are logistically difficult, and it is unlikely that another "Casualty@Holby City" episode will be produced in the "foreseeable future". 

In September 2010, "Holby City" nurse Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs) appeared in "Casualty", and Kent hopes that characters from the two shows will begin to crossover two or three times a year.

On 27 April 2006, the BBC announced "Holby Blue", a police procedural spin-off from "Holby City". It was created by Tony Jordan.

"Holby City" was moved to Thursdays for the duration of "HolbyBlue" first series, with the spin-off broadcast on Tuesday nights at 8 pm. 
In 2008, a two-part crossover episode with "Holby City" was developed for the beginning of the show's second series. The episodes were written by McHale and Jordan. "Holby City" registrar Jac Naylor accused of murder. 
Yorke compared the crossover to the American "CSI" franchise, in that: "You really believe it's a world."

The second series attracted 5.6 million viewers to its opening episode. By the end of May 2008 viewer numbers had fallen to 2.5 million. 
In August 2008, the BBC announced that, due to lower ratings, "Holby Blue" would not be recommissioned for a third series.

In June 2002, cast members from "Holby City" and "Casualty" competed against the "EastEnders" cast for the first "Sport Relief" fundraiser, dubbed "Sport in the Square". The teams competed in events such as taxi pulling, melon tossing and a beer keg relay. 
The competition was shown on BBC One, and the event raised £10 million. 

In October 2003, BBC One aired a "Kenyon Confronts" documentary by "Panorama" reporter Paul Kenyon, investigating hospitals run by the Private Finance Initiative. He discovered many problems within the hospitals, which were dramatised by the "Holby City" cast in specially written scenes. 

In March 2004, the documentary "Making It at Holby" was made as part of a BBC initiative to develop new acting talent. The documentary followed the casting process of "Holby City" and "Casualty", from the audition stages to the filming of the selected actors' first scenes.

In November 2006, the "Children in Need" charity telethon included a segment featuring the "Holby City" cast performing a comical version of "Hung Up" by Madonna. 

In November 2007 "Children in Need" appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Sharon D Clarke, backed by Nadine Lewington, Rakie Ayola and Phoebe Thomas performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, "Respect".

On 28 June 2008, "Holby City" stars competed against their "Casualty" counterparts in a special charity edition of BBC Two game-show "The Weakest Link". 

In February 2010, "Holby City" and "Casualty" cast members performed a dance rendition of "Jai Ho" for "Let's Dance for Sport Relief".

"Holby City" has been compared to other medical dramas, often unfavourable. 

In November 2002, John Whiston, then head of drama at Granada Television, accused the BBC of producing inferior "parodies" of ITV drama. He commented "With "Holby City" cloned out of "Casualty", the BBC has even ended up copying itself." 

Paul Hoggart of "The Times" says that the differences between the two shows are "mild", calling "Holby City": ""Casualty" cute little sister". 

Kevin Lygo, director of television at Channel 4, referred to "Holby City" as "sudsy drama", deeming it, "Casualty" and "HolbyBlue" "all decent programmes, but strikingly similar in many aspects of their tone and construction." 

"Holby City" has been unfavourably compared with the American medical drama "ER". Television producer Paul Abbott has commented that although he watches "ER", he does not watch "Holby City" as: "it looks like you've crammed one hour's drama into 26 episodes." 

In October 2009, former "Holby City" writer Peter Jukes wrote a critical piece for "Prospect" magazine, contrasting the show negatively with the standard of American television dramas. Jukes wrote that "Holby City" has become a soap opera, rather than a drama, and deemed the episodes he worked on "the most dispiriting experiences in [his] 25 years as a dramatist."

In August 2002, Paul Bolt, director of the Broadcasting Standards Commission criticised BBC programming as being "humdrum" and "formulaic", saying of "Holby City" and the police procedural "Mersey Beat": "One begins to wonder what really is the point of the BBC bringing this to us. Let's have something a bit different." Then head of BBC drama Jane Tranter responded that Bolt's examples were "highly selective" as well as "hugely patronising to the millions of viewers who enjoy popular dramas like "Holby City" – week in, week out". Young, who at the time held the position of head of drama serials, told "The Guardian": "Popular drama has always been singled out for criticism, but people are increasingly voting with their on-buttons." 

At the 2003 Edinburgh International Television Festival, BSykB chief executive Tony Ball called for stricter restrictions on how the BBC spent licence payers' money, suggesting that "Holby City" be sold to the channel's commercial rivals, with the proceeds used to develop more original programming. The BBC refused Ball's suggestion, responding in a statement: "This speech clearly reflects BSkyB's view that programmes are merely a commodity to be bought and sold."

In 2003, former BBC host Sir Ludovic Kennedy complained that ethnic minorities were over-represented on television, prompting a BBC spokeswoman to explain that "Holby City" has more ethnic characters as it is set in an area where minorities account for up to 30% of the population. According to the 2001 census, the population of Bristol – which the city of Holby is loosely based upon – is 88% white and 12% ethnic minorities.

In October 2003, "Holby City" was praised by campaigners for the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), when an episode which coincided with "Learn To Sign Week" used deaf actors, and featured characters communicating through British Sign Language. RNID chief executive John Low stated: "Too often individuals have to rely on family members or friends to communicate complicated personal information to professionals. This is the reason the RNID is calling on the government to channel funding into the training of British Sign Language interpreters who could then be available to NHS staff treating deaf patients." Stokes commented: "The writer had a great story he wanted to tell – for us, that's what matters first and foremost."

In June 2004, Charles Allen, chief executive of ITV plc questioned the amount of funding spent on lengthened episodes of "Holby City", 

A 2008 a Channel 4 report into ethnic diversity on television, cited "Holby City" as a positive example of "diverse British programm[ing]". 

In January 2010, Janet Street-Porter in "The Independent", said "Holby City" had "come to the end of [its] natural life" and should be cancelled.

The show has been criticised for its lack of realism. 

In February 2004, nurse Vici Hoban said that there were three nurse stereotypes. "Sex object, doctor's handmaiden, or angel". She felt that the media had increased these misconceptions. She said that with "the syringe-toting serial killer Kelly in "Holby City", realism has never been top of TV's agenda." Hoban felt that the worst offender at the time was the Channel 4 medical drama "No Angels". She described as: "so inaccurate that it makes "Holby City" look like a factual documentary." 

In November 2009, Antony Sumara, CEO of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Hospital Trust, wrote a column criticising "Holby City" for misrepresenting real hospital life. 

In December 2009, Tom Sutcliffe of "The Independent" reviewed an episode, finding it "astonishing" that any patients leave Holby General alive, as the staff are "so busy looking stricken or lovelorn at each other".

Misuse of alcohol has been criticised.

In December 2003, "The Times" Libby Purves wrote a critical opinion piece, observing that "Holby City" medical staff are often depicted getting drunk in clubs, but afterwards are able to function properly at work, and that as a result, alcohol "is made to look innocent". 

In October 2004, Canon Kenyon Wright, chair of Alcohol Focus Scotland, criticised an episode of "Holby City" which saw doctors downing tequila slammers, stating that it glamorised irresponsible drinking. 

In October 2007, drinks' industry body the Portman Group made an official complaint to communications regulator Ofcom about a scene in "Holby City" which depicted two medics drinking five shots of tequila following a stressful day at work. The body's chief executive David Poley claimed that in failing to show the negative consequences of this action, the series was presenting a "highly irresponsible portrayal of excessive and rapid drinking". Ofcom received a total of eight complaints about the incident.

"Holby City" has also been accused of medical inaccuracies. 

In January 2004, the British Medical Association denounced an episode which showed organ donation being done despite withdrawal of consent by the patient's relatives. Dr Michael Wilks, chairman of the Medical Ethics Committee stated: "This simply would not happen, but its portrayal, even in a drama, is totally irresponsible and risks causing huge damage to the already struggling transplant programme." 

In 2005, the British Medical Association said that the show was giving viewers an unrealistic impression of resuscitation by typically presenting only two outcomes, death or total recovery. Andrew Thomson, a Dundee GP, deemed this "a terrible distortion of the truth." 

In 2009, "The Times", Vivienne Parry highlighted the fact that in reality, less than half of patients who require resuscitation survive the initial event. Of those, only a third live to leave hospital. 

In April 2010, at the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) conference in Bournemouth, "Holby City" was accused of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS, encouraging patients to believe in miracles and fuelling a compensation culture. Accident and Emergency nurse John Hill stated: "In A&E it is sometimes a fact that sadly we cannot get people through the trauma they have received. Unfortunately, unlike in "Holby City", I am a mere mortal and cannot perform miracles. But many relatives believe because of that, you can. And the injury lawyers assure them that if you don't they will get recompense for it."

In October 2000, Dr John Ryan, an Accident & Emergency consultant at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton criticised the number of patients visiting the department for minor problems without first seeing their GP. Ryan attributed this to patients watching "Holby City" and falsely seeing hospitals as glamorous. 

In September 2008, a three-year Belgian research project, presented at a British Psychological Society meeting, claimed that watching "Holby City" and similar medical dramas such as "Casualty" and "ER" had a subliminal influence on fear of illness. 1,300 teenagers were questioned on their viewing habits, and those who watched more medical dramas were found to be up to 10% more fearful about their health.

In 2008, Conservative Party strategists identified four archetypes based on TV programmes to help the party target swing voters. Alongside ""Top Gear" man", ""Apprentice" generation" and ""Grand Designs" couple", they identified ""Holby City" worker", a middle-ranking health service worker. In 2009, they identified ""Holby City" woman" as a key voter demographic who may help the party win the 2010 General Election. The ""Holby City" woman" is a female voter in her 30s or 40s, employed in a clinical or clerical position or some other public sector job. She is a swing voter in General Elections, The ""Holby City" woman" archetype is modelled on the character of Faye Morton.

In January 2009, Jill Berry, president of the Girls' Schools Association and head teacher at the Dame Alice Harpur School in Bedford, cited medical dramas such as "Holby City" as an inspiring force in increasing numbers of female students deciding to pursue careers in medicine. Berry explained: "The girls see that as an exciting and dynamic way of life. They see it as making a difference to people's lives. It gives them a sense sometimes of the pressures, responsibility and adrenaline. Such TV programmes can be good, as long as they give a realistic impression." Similarly, consultant surgeon Andrew Raftery uses clips from "Holby City" as part of the University of Sheffield Outreach and Access to Medicine Scheme, to inspire pupils from under-represented social and educational backgrounds to pursue careers in medicine.

Kafana

Kafana () (in Serbian and Slovene), kafene\kafenë (pl. kafenejet\kafenët) (in Albanian), kafeana (кафеана, in Macedonian), kavana () (in Croatian), καφενείο\kafenio (pl. καφενεία\kafenia) (in Greek), cafenea (pl. cafenele) (in Romanian) are words used in the former Yugoslav countries and Albania for a specific type of local bistro which mostly serves alcohol and coffee, and often also light snacks and other food. Most kafanas feature live music.

The idea of a social meeting place for men to drink alcohol and coffee started in the Ottoman Empire and spread to the Balkans while it was under Ottoman rule. Over time, this became the modern kafana.


The word 'kafana' is taken from the Turkish word "kahvehane" ("coffeehouse") which is in turn taken from the Persian word "qahveh-khaneh" (a compound of the Arabic "qahve" [coffee] and Persian "khane" [house]).

In Macedonia, the word "kafeana" is sometimes used as if it means the same as "meana", while the variant "kafana" (adopted from Serbian folk-songs and made popular by artists) may be used for the kafana described in this article; however, both terms are used as if they have the same meaning by some people.

Nowadays in Serbia, the term "kafana" is used to describe any informal restaurant serving traditional cuisine, as well as some other kafana dishes like Karađorđeva šnicla.

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, running a kafana (then usually called "mehana") was a family business, passed on from generation to generation.

As the Balkan cities grew in size and became more urban, the kafana also changed. Some started serving food and offering other things to customers since the owners now had to compete with other similar places around the city. Most bigger towns and cities in this time had a "Gradska kafana" (City kafana) located in or around main square where the richest and most important people of that city would come to see and be seen. Prices in this kafana would usually be higher than others around the city that didn't have such an exclusive location.

Live music was first used in kafane in the early 20th century by kafana owners looking to offer different kinds of entertainment to their guests. Naturally, since there was no mass media these bands were local and would only play folk music that was popular in the local region.

As the 20th century began, Balkan cities saw lots of rural people move in, especially after World War II, and kafane changed for this. Some stayed the same, caring for the upper-class, while others began to change to be better for the new rural population who mostly worked in factories and on construction sites.

This is when the word "kafana" slowly began to mean something that you did not want and that was only for lower classes of society, like a ghetto. By the 1980s, calling a restaurant a "kafana" almost became an insult and most owners would not call their restaurants kafane. Instead, they used words like "restaurant", "cafe", "bistro", "coffee bar", &c. instead.

Now, the kafana is thought of as a place where sad lovers cure their sorrows in alcohol and music, gamblers waste lots of, husbands run away from mean wives while shady businessmen, corrupt local politicians and small criminals do business. Going to kafane often is seen as something that more men would do than women, and "honest" women dare only visit finer ones, and usually while they are with men.

This is mentioned in late-20th century folk songs, like "I tebe sam sit kafano" ("I'm Already Sick of You, Kafana") by Haris Džinović, "Kafana je moja sudbina" ("Kafana is My Destiny") by Toma Zdravković, and "Čaše lomim" ("I'm Breaking Glasses"), by Nezir Eminovski.

Hollow Earth

The Hollow Earth is a concept proposing that the planet Earth is entirely hollow or contains a substantial inner space. Edmond Halley suggested this in the late 17th century. Pierre Bouguer tried to prove this idea false, in 1740. Charles Hutton could falsify the idea in his Schiehallion experiment around 1774.

It was still occasionally defended through the mid 19th century, notably by John Cleves Symmes Jr. and Jeremiah N. Reynolds, but by this time was part of popular pseudoscience and no longer a scientifically viable hypothesis.

The concept of a hollow Earth still recurs in folklore and as the premise for subterranean fiction, and a subgenre of adventure fiction ("Journey to the Center of the Earth", "At the Earth's Core").

Hollow Earth is also used in Godzilla vs. Kong as a major plot point.

List of Intellivision games

This is a list of cartridges and cassettes for the Intellivision game system. Some cartridges were released by both Mattel Electronics and Sears Tele-Games, and later Intellivision Inc. Between 1979 and 1989, a total of 133 titles were released:

Most of this information is from the Game Catalog of IntellivisionLives.com. Some games were also released under different names when they were released again in "Intellivision Lives!".
All early games that were published by Mattel Electronics were categorized as "Network"s. Each network had its own color that was used for the game box. The network concept was abandoned in late 1982.

These are the cartridges released from 1979 to 1990, back when the Intellivision was made. The cartridges that use the Intellivision are included here. Even though the cartridges are designed to be played with the Intellivoice peripheral, they can be played without the Intellivoice peripheral.

Except for one of these cartridges, these cartridges need the ECS Computer Adapter and either the Computer Keyboard or Music Synthesizer peripherals.

Keyboard Component cassettes had limited availability through direct mail or select markets. Only 4000 Keyboard Components were made.

This is a list of Intellivision games that were mostly completed but not released. Keyboard Component software that would have been on cassette tape is also included. Technical demos, store demos, and test cartridges are not included. "Air Strike" is one game that is possibly unfinished, but is included in this list because the found prototype is a playable game. "Hypnotic Lights" is not included because it is mostly a technical demo. "Grid Shock" is excluded due to a lack of game play. Some of the games were not released because of marketing decisions, and others because Mattel Electronics shut down in January 1984. Except for where it otherwise says, this information comes from the list of "Unreleased Intellivision Games" at IntellivisionLives.com.

In a 2014 interview, APh programmer Tom Loughry said in 1982, he and another APh programmer started a third Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game which was abandoned when he left the company. He also worked on a Keyboard Component cassette game called "Super Football". It is not known how complete Super Football is. In a 2015 interview with Russ Haft, manager of the Intellivision programming group at Atari, it was said as well as the four games, released versions of "Joust, Jungle Hunt, Pole Position, and Missile Command" were completed or close to completion. Missile Command would have been dropped because of poor playability. A June 1983 press release from CBS Electronics announced "Wizard of War" and "Gorf" to be released in July 1983 and "Blueprint, Solar Fox", and "Omega Race" cartridges in August 1983. This suggests "Wizard of War" and "Gorf" were completed and programming on the others at least started. Other announced games such as Imagic "Wing War" and "Moonsweeper" have little information about their status.

There are games Intellivision fans and hobbyists created.

Square root of 2

The square root of 2, or the (1/2)th power of 2, written in mathematics as or , is the positive irrational number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the number 2. To be more correct, it is called the principal square root of 2, to tell it apart from the negative version of itself where that is also true.

Geometrically, the square root of 2 is the length of a diagonal across a square with sides with a length of one; this can be found with the Pythagorean theorem. Because of that, it is also called the Pythagoras's constant.

The number formula_1 is not rational. Here is the proof.


Therefore, it is not true that formula_1 is a rational number. So formula_1 must be irrational.


Gladius

A gladius is a Roman short sword mainly used by gladiators and normal soldiers in Ancient Rome.

The Roman gladius came from the Celtiberians of Hispania, more specifically a sword used in the Second Punic War. When Rome won the Second Punic War, they adopted the gladius into the Roman army, which they adapted slightly to their needs for a soldier's sword.

After the military reforms of Gaius Marius during his consulships, the roman soldier was armed with a sword (gladius), a shield (scutum), two spears (pila), most of the time a dagger (pugio), and later in roman history, some throwing darts (plumbatae).

Roman soldiers in battle would throw pila to disrupt the enemy and make their shields usless, then go into close hand to hand fighting, in which the gladius was used.

Appeasement

Appeasement is a diplomatic policy of meeting political demands to a possibly-aggressive power to avoid conflict.

The term was used especially for the foreign policy of the British governments of Prime Ministers Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain towards Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy between 1935 and 1939. It was supported by most people there and in France, most notably under Édouard Daladier, because people feared another world war.


Die casting

Die casting is a type of metal casting that forces molten metal into the empty space of the mold. The mold is made by using two hardened tool steel dies which are machined into shape. These work like an injection mold.

Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals (meaning they do not have iron). These metals are zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter, and tin-based alloys. Depending on what type of metal is being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.

The casting equipment and the metal dies are expensive. This means it is used only on things that need to be made a large number of times. It is simple to make things using die casting, and it has only four main steps. This helps keep the cost of the items lower. Die casting works well for many small- to medium-sized castings, which is why it is used to make more castings than any other casting process. Die castings have a very good surface finish (compared to other types of casting) and consistent sizes.

Dean Kamen

Dean Lawrence Kamen (born April 5, 1951) is an American engineer, inventor, and businessman. He is known for inventing the Segway and founding the non-profit organization FIRST with Woodie Flowers.

Kamen is best known for inventing the product that eventually became known as the Segway PT. It is an electric, self-balancing vehicle. The device is balanced on two parallel wheels and is controlled by moving body weight. The machine had a lot of attention after parts of a book quoting Steve Jobs and other notable IT inventors talking about its revolutionary potential were leaked in December 2001.

Kamen was already a successful inventor: his company "Auto Syringe" manufactures and markets the first drug infusion pump. His company DEKA also holds patents for the technology used in portable dialysis machines, an insulin pump (based on the drug infusion pump technology), and an all-terrain electric wheelchair known as the iBOT, using many of the same balancing technologies that were later used on the Segway.
Kamen has worked a lot on a project involving Stirling engine designs. It tries to create two machines: one that would generate power, and the Slingshot that would be a water purification system. He hopes the project will help improve living standards in developing countries. Kamen has a patent on his water purifier, and other patents pending. In 2014, the film "SlingShot" was released, which showed Kamen's quest to use his machine to fix the world's water crisis.

Kamen is also the co-inventor of a compressed air device that would launch a human into the air. This would be used to quickly launch SWAT teams or other emergency workers to the roofs of tall, hard-to-reach buildings.

In 2009 Kamen stated that his company DEKA was now working on solar powered inventions.

Kamen and DEKA also made the DEKA Arm System or "Luke", a prosthetic arm replacement that gives much more fine motor control than other prosthetic limbs. It was approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2014, and DEKA is looking for partners to mass-produce the prosthesis.

In 1989, Kamen founded FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), a program for students to get people interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). One competition started and run by FIRST is the FRC or FIRST Robotics Competition. In 2017, FIRST chose to host two international competitions, one in St. Louis, Missouri, and another in Houston, Texas, each a week apart. From 2018 to 2020, it will be held in Detroit, Michigan, instead of St. Louis, Missouri.

FIRST has many robotics programs for students in grades K-12, including FLL JR. (FIRST Lego League Jr.) for younger elementary school students, FLL (FIRST Lego League) for older elementary school and middle school students, FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) for middle and high school students, and FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) for high school students. In 2017, FIRST held the inaugural event of its first olympics-style competition – FGC (FIRST Global Challenge) – in Washington, D.C. 

Kamen says that FIRST is the invention he is most proud of. He predicts that the 1 million students who have taken part in the contests so far will create important inventions in the future.

Woodie Flowers

Woodie Claude Flowers (November 18, 1943 – October 11, 2019) was a professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He worked on engineering design and product development. He also held the Pappalardo Professorship and was a MacVicar Faculty Fellow.

Flowers was born in Jena, Louisiana on November 18, 1943. He was named after his grandfathers Woodie and Claude. His father, Abe Flowers, was a welder and inventor. His mother, Bertie Graham, was an elementary-school and special education teacher. As a boy, he showed mechanical aptitude like his father, Abe, and he earned the rank of Eagle Scout. When he was seventeen, he and four friends were driving on Louisiana Highway 127 when they were hit head-on by another vehicle that was traveling at about . The accident killed two people in Flowers' vehicle and one in the other. It made him believe what he called "genetic opposition to violence" and created his "fierce, vocal loathing of any spectacle that involves crashing pieces of machinery into each other with deliberate force."

Flowers went to Louisiana Polytechnic Institute and graduated with his B.S. in 1966. He then went to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), earning his M.S. (1968), M.E. (1971), and Ph.D. (1973) under the direction of Bob Mann. His thesis, called "A man-interactive simulator system for above-knee prosthetics studies," was on a robot-like prosthetic knee inspired by Mann's Boston Arm.

After receiving his doctorate (Ph.D.), Flowers began as an assistant professor at MIT. He worked with Herb Richardson on the "Introduction to Design and Manufacturing" class. Known by its course number as 2.70 (now 2.007), the class had a design competition to build robotic devices to accomplish a challenge. Flowers took over the class in 1974, changing it into one of the most popular classes at MIT. He changed the challenge every year, always trying to make it more complex and exciting. The competition was shown on TV several years on the PBS show "Discover the World of Science". The competition became like a sporting event, and was even jokingly referred to as MIT's true homecoming game. In 1987, Flowers handed the class over to Harry West.

"Discover the World of Science" changed its name to "Scientific American Frontiers" in 1990, and Flowers served as its host until 1993 when he was replaced by Alan Alda. In 1990, Flowers began working with Dean Kamen on FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), a project to promote science and technology. Taking parts from 2.70, they created the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) in 1992. Flowers brought the phrase "gracious professionalism" to FIRST, an idea which has since become very important in FIRST rules and culture. Flowers served every year as National Advisor to FIRST. He was active at FIRST events, working as an MC and treated along with Kamen "like heroes."

At the 2017 VEX Robotics World Championship, Woodie Flowers was inducted into the STEM Hall of Fame.

Flowers was a "Distinguished Partner" at Olin College, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2007, he received a degree "honoris causa" from Chilean university Universidad Nacional Andrés Bello. He died on October 11, 2019, in Massachusetts following complications from aorta surgery.

In 1996, the FIRST Robotics Competition created the Woodie Flowers award, which was given to Flowers that year. In years since, the award has served as a way for FRC teams to honor adult mentors. At each FRC regional competition a Woodie Flowers Finalist Award is presented to one adult who was nominated. This qualifies them for the Championship Woodie Flowers Award (WFA) presented at the FIRST Championship.


Encoder

Encoder may refer to:




Abuse of power

Abuse of power is the act of taking advantage of one's high authority in order to control what other people with lower authority are able to do. Abuse of power is often associated with corruption. Often, presidents are charged with abuse of power because they pressure all of the less powerful politicians into doing things that the other politicians disagree with. Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, was impeached on December 2019 because of a scandal where he agreed with Ukraine to manipulate the 2020 presidential election in exchange for foreign aid.

Rotary encoder

A rotary encoder is a device that can keep track of how much something has turned. This is called its angular position. That information is useful to know how far a motor has turned, for example. 

Rotary encoders are often used in manufacturing and robotics. This is because they need things to be measured and controlled very accurately.

An absolute encoder always keeps track of what value its on, even if it isn't powered.

An incremental encoder only keeps track of changes. It gives off signals if it is turned one way or another. 

List of cities and towns in California

California is a state in the Western United States. It is the state with the most people, as 39,538,223 people lived there in 2020.

California is split into 58 counties and has 482 municipalities. One county, San Francisco, is a city-county, which means it is both a municipality and county. In California law, there is no difference between a city and town. This means municipalities can use either name.

The largest municipality by population is Los Angeles, which had 3,898,747 people living there in 2020. The smallest is Amador City, with 200 people living there in 2020.

Cease and desist

A cease and desist letter is a document sent to an individual or business to stop attempted illegal activity ("cease") and not to restart it ("desist"). The letter may warn to the individual or business that if they do not stop certain behaviour by deadlines set in the letter, then that individual or business may be sued. The same letter may also warn the individual or business to take specified actions in order to avoid being sued. When a cease and desist letter is issued by a public authority, it is called a "cease and desist order".

Although cease and desist letters are not exclusively used for stopping copyright infringement, such letters are also used to protect other issues related to intellectual property. The holder of an intellectual property right (i.e. either a copyrighted work, a trademark, or a patent) may send the cease and desist letter to tell a third party (i.e. an individual or business who is not related to the holder of the intellectual property right) that they are infringing intellectual property. The letter may contain either an offer to license the intellectual property or a very clear threat of a lawsuit. A cease and desist letter often causes both parties to make licensing negotiations, and is very often the first step towards a lawsuit.

If someone receives many cease and desist letters, it will cost a large amount of money to manage them. Each claim in the letters must be evaluated, and the person or group who receives it will have to decide what to do to sort out the cease and desist letter. Either, they would have to obtain an attorney's opinion letter, prepare for a lawsuit, and perhaps start making suitable alternatives that do not break the holder's intellectual property.

Cease and desist letters are sometimes used to intimidate the offending groups and can be used by corporations to relax the online critical speech of such groups. A company owning a trademark may send such letter to them that they are doing trademark infringement, although the actual use of the trademark by the offending group may fall under a fair use exception (which follows, in the U.S., the protection of free speech under the First Amendment).


Pepe the Frog

Pepe the Frog is an internet meme. He is an anthropomorphic green frog who had originated in a comic by Matt Furie called "Boy's Club". He appears in many different types of popular memes on the internet. By 2015, he is the most popular meme in 4chan and Tumblr.

Ryukyuan people

The Ryukyuan people (琉球民族, Okinawan: "Ruuchuu minzuku"; Japanese: "Ryuukyuu minzoku") are the natives of the Ryūkyū Islands, a collection of islands located in Japan.

The Ryukyuans descend from the Jōmon and Yayoi peoples.

By the 14th century, numerous chiefs ruled the Ryukyu Islands. In Okinawa, a new chief named Tamagusuku was unpopular among local lords, causing the island to be split into three kingdoms (Chūzan, Nanzan and Hokuzan). By the 15th century, the island was re-united, causing the Ryukyu Kingdom to be born. In the following centuries, the Ryukyu Kingdom would expand its rule over the Amami, Miyako and Yaeyama islands. They would also become a vassal state of China.

In 1609, the Japanese domain of Satsuma took over the Ryukyu Kingdom. The Amami Islands were then ruled by Satsuma, whereas the rest of the Ryukyu Kingdom was turned into a vassal.

In 1872, the Ryukyu Kingdom became the Ryūkyū Domain. In 1879, the Japanese Empire took control of the country.

After Japanese annexation happened, the local cultures and languages of Ryukyu were suppressed. Children who spoke the native Ryukyuan languages at school were punished with dialect cards.

During the Battle of Okinawa (World War II), between 40,000 and 150,000 Okinawans were killed. After World War II ended, the Ryukyu Islands were placed under American administration. The Amami Islands were returned to Japan in 1953, whereas the ofher island groups were returned in 1972.

Many Ryukyuans (especially the diaspora communities in Hawaii and Brazil) consider themselves to be different from the Japanese, who mainly inhabit the mainland (Honshū, Kyūshū, Shikoku and Hokkaidō).

On the other hand, many other Ryukyuans identify as “Japanese”, which is the result of assimilation that dates back to the Meiji Era.

Historically, the Ryukyuans spoke the Ryukyuan languages. Because Japan suppressed them in the past, they are all endangered, with most speakers being elderly. A Japanese speaker wouldn't be able to understand any of the six Ryukyuan languages without any knowledge out of it. Despite this, the Japanese government calls the Ryukyuan languages ”Japanese dialects” for political reasons. Most linguists on the other hand refer to the Ryukyuan languages as separate languages.

The native religion of the Ryukyuans is the Ryukyuan religion, an animistic faith that believes in ancestor worship. Other religions practiced in Ryukyu include Shintoism, Buddhism and Christianity.

They take place during the first half of February, they are considered as the winter celebrations of the town and since 2018 they have been recognized as a Festival of Tourist Interest in Aragon.

It exists proof of at least three centuries of celebration of Saint Blas and Saint Águeda in Mequinenza, a tradition that stressed when, with the construction of the reservoir of Riba-red in the years 70, the Old Village remained under the river Ebro and the urban core of the place had to move to his current location to few kilometres water up, to river banks Segre. Historically, the procession of Saint Blas ran to charge of the men and the one of Saint Águeda to the women, but the natural evolution of the tradition has comported that in the actuality the Commissions of Saint Blas and Santa Águeda are exclusively formed by women that purchase a special leadership during the days of celebration. Saint Blas and Santa Águeda took importance during the Franco regime, since although it was forbidden to disguise, Mequinenza continued challenging the prohibition imposed by the authorities, a fact that boosted even more the popular rooting and the singular character of the tradition.

The festivity initiates with the delivery of the Clave of Control to the Commissions of Saint Blas and Santa Águeda, to continue the day 3 February with the religious celebrations of Saint Blas and the day 5 with the ones of Santa Águeda. The day concludes with the known contests of costumes artesanales for small and greater, at the same time that diverse and colourful rúas visit the population accompanied of music in direct. During the celebrations elaborate “cokes”, a sweet typical traditional to base of oil, flour and water, to which adds a secret ingredient that knows only each Commission. The process of preparation of “cokes” transmits of generation in generation through the members of the Commission of Saint Blas and Santa Águeda.

Tradition, party and colour join during the parties, filling the population during these days of national visitors and foreigners attracted by the big espectacularidad of the handmade costumes. The groups parade by the streets of the place disguised with attires of historical characters, imaginary or of fiction to rhythm of musics varied. The works of preparation of the costumes initiate months before the festivity with an intense work done entirely manually, fruit of the creativity and the wit in which it involves all the population. The festivity of Saint Blas and Santa Águeda is the expression of the collective effort and the artistic expression of all the population of Mequinenza, as well as a signal of identity and referent in all the Region of the Low/Baix Cinca.

Minié ball

The Minié ball, or Minni ball, is a type of muzzle-loading spin-stabilized bullet for rifled muskets named after its developer, Claude-Étienne Minié, inventor of the French Minié rifle. It came to prominence in the Crimean War and American Civil War.

Rifling, the addition of spiral grooves inside a gun barrel, givesa spin to a bullet, greatly increasing the range and accuracy of a gun. Before the Minié ball, balls had to be jammed down the rifle barrel, sometimes with a mallet, and after a relatively small number of shots, gunpowder leftovers built up in the spiral grooves, which then had to be cleaned out. The development of the Minié ball was significant, because it was the first projectile that was small enough to be easily put down the barrel of a rifled long gun. Both the American Springfield Model 1861 and the British Pattern 1853 Enfield rifled muskets, the most common weapons used during the American Civil War, used the Minié ball.

The Minié ball did a lot if damage in the American Civil War. It made it really hard for surgeons to treat wounded soldiers because Minié balls shattered bones often.

Crossroads (British TV series)

Crossroads (later known as Crossroads Motel) is a British television soap opera. It was shown on ITV. It began in 1964 and finished in 1988. There was a revival from 2001 to 2003.

"Crossroads" was set in a fictional motel in the Midlands. "Crossroads" was later called a hotel. The show became a byword for cheap production values. Despite this, the series regularly attracted huge audiences. It had as many as 15 million viewers.

It was created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling and produced by ATV. In 1981, Central Independent Television took over ATV's broadcast licence and continued the programme until it was cancelled in 1988. In 2001, the series was revived by Carlton Television. It was cancelled again in 2003.

The original idea of "Crossroads" was based around two feuding sisters, Kitty Jarvis, played by Beryl Johnstone, and Meg Richardson, played by Noele Gordon. Meg is a wealthy woman. She had her late husband Charles' insurance money, and compensation money from the council. The compensation was for them building a motorway through her land. Meg used her money to turn her large Georgian house into a motel.

"The Crossroads Motel" was located near the fictional small village of King's Oak. This was on the edge of Birmingham. Meg had two children. A girl named Jill, played by Jane Rossington), born in 1946, and a boy Alexander, born in 1950. Alexander was called "Sandy" and played by Roger Tonge.

The other sister, Kitty, is married to the unemployed Dick played by Brian Kent. She is not wealthy. Dick and Kitty bought a newsagents and tobacconists shop in the nearby town of Heathbury a few years after the show started. Kitty and Dick had a son called Brian, played by David Fennell, born in 1945. The story idea of the sisters feuding was dropped early in the series.

Characters in the show's early years included Meg and Kitty's brother, Andy Fraser, played by Ian Patterson. In 1965, Andy marries motel secretary Ruth Bailey, played by Pamela Greenhall. Other characters in the first series include

Amy was briefly arrested as a suspected Soviet spy.

In 1966, long running character Diane Lawton, played by Susan Hanson arrived. Other additions included

Perhaps the most memorable character was the "village idiot" Benny Hawkins, played by Paul Henry. His trademark was a woolly hat that he wore all the time. His fans included British troops serving in the Falklands War. In 1982, they nicknamed the Falkland Islanders "Bennies" after the character. Instructed to stop using the name, the troops came up with "Stills" for locals - because they were "still Bennies".

The series had storylines which were controversial at the time. These include

The series also saw black characters appearing regularly. This followed from the 1960s BBC soap "Compact". This was also created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling. Melanie Harper, played by Cleo Sylvestre, arrived at the motel in 1970 as Meg's foster daughter. Sylvestre was given the role by producer Reg Watson after press coverage of racial tensions in Birmingham.
In 1977, an interracial summer romance took place between Cockney garage mechanic Dennis Harper, played by Guy Ward, and motel receptionist Meena Chaudri, played by Karen David.
In 1978, garage mechanic Joe MacDonald, played by Carl Andrews, arrived.

In 1981, a storyline about a false accusation of rape.
In 1983, a storyline about a test tube baby born to Glenda and Kevin Banks, played by Lynette McMorrough and David Moran.
In 1983, the subject of Down syndrome was also raised when a little girl was befriended by three of the regular characters.

The character of Meg Mortimer was axed in 1981. She was thought to have died in a motel fire. Later she turned up alive aboard the QE2, about to sail to a new life overseas. Newspapers reported that two endings were planned for Meg. She would either die in the fire or disappear and turn up on the QE2. Viewers were surprised to see producers had used both. Meg returned briefly in 1983 for a reunion with Jill and Adam on their honeymoon in Venice.

In 1985, new producer Phillip Bowman was planning to bring the character of Meg Mortimer back into the show as a "permanent occasional." Plans were well advanced when Noele Gordon died in April of that year, aged 65. Edward Clayton was brought back as Jill's ex-husband Stan Harvey to read the lines originally written for Gordon.

In 1986, the new character Ray Grice played by Al Hunter Ashton was introduced as part of an attempt to create wider storylines. 

In 2001, the show was revived. Changes were made to characters and stories. Jill Chance had married John Maddingham, played by Jeremy Nicholas. She had been widowed and was calling herself Jill Harvey again. This had been her name before her marriage to Adam Chance in 1983. References were also made to the Russell family taking over a "failing motel", despite Crossroads having become a hotel in the late 1980s. In the final episode of the original series, the name 'King's Oak Country Hotel' was seen over the entrance doors.

Lack of real links to the past, and the killing of Jill a few months into the new run, turned many fans away. Popular characters in the new "Crossroads" included new owner Kate Russell, played by Jane Gurnett. Receptionist Virginia Raven, played by Sherrie Hewson, and womanising deputy manager Jake Booth, played by Colin Wells. The storyline of the final episode was the revelation that the revived series and glamorous hotel had been a dream of supermarket worker and Crossroads fan Angela, with all the other characters revealed as shoppers. Angela even approaches a female customer in the supermarket and tells her she recognises her as "Tracey Booth from Crossroads". Tracey's mother-in-law, Kate, was also shown as one of Angela's colleagues in the supermarket.


"Crossroads" began its run on Monday 2 November 1964. It was shown five days a week. The episodes were recorded "as live", a common practice at the time, with few opportunities for retakes. Within a few months, 10 of the ITV companies had started broadcasting the series. Granada never screened it during the 1960s. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) decreed in 1967 that "Crossroads" should be reduced to four episodes per week to improve its quality.
The series was no longer networked and each ITV station broadcast the show on different days.

The series was widely derided by critics who criticised the wobbly sets and fluffed lines, but gained many fans. Prime Minister Harold Wilson's wife Mary complained when the newly formed Thames Television decided to stop showing it in 1968. The decision proved unpopular with viewers and was reversed six months later. As a result of the gap in transmission, viewers in the Thames region were six months behind the rest of the country for several years. In 1972, Granada became the last ITV company to show "Crossroads". By the early 1970s it was second only to "Coronation Street" in the ratings. In the mid-1970s it beat "Coronation Street" gaining audiences of up to 15 million viewers.

From April 1980, the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), commercial television's regulator, decided production should be reduced further to three episodes a week. The chairman of the IBA Lady Plowden described the soap opera as "distressingly popular".
ATV planned to replace the fourth episode with a spin-off series called "A Family Affair" but this idea was dropped. Series star Noele Gordon, who played Meg Richardson, regularly won the "TV Times" Most Popular Female Personality viewers award during the 1970s.

Viewers reacted negatively at the dismissal of Gordon in 1981, an action taken by head of programming Charles Denton. He became a "national hate figure".
The series producer Jack Barton agreed with Denton that Gordon's character had become too dominant.

Why Gordon was sacked remains a mystery to TV historians as she was the most popular character on the soap and no real reason was given other than that producers felt it was time for a change. The actress herself was terribly upset by the decision. She was the only cast member on a permanent contract. She had been misled that the meeting where she was dismissed was to be the annual negotiation for the next years contract. In interviews she made it clear that she did not want to go. There is debate about the reason for her dismissal. Some people have said that Gordon's attitude within the company had upset some executives and they simply wanted rid of her. Gordon was very passionate about the soap and would regularly defend it against the many critics. Others believe that ITV found Crossroads an embarrassment and wanted to find a way of decreasing the viewing figures by sacking Gordon. She was the biggest audience draw. With fewer viewers it could be justified to axe it. Whatever the reason, the series never recovered from her loss.

ATV lost its ITV franchise at the end of 1981. It was ordered by the IBA to reform into Central Independent Television. It took over the franchise on 1 January 1982. It was thought to have little enthusiasm for the programmes it inherited.
Further changes were introduced in March 1985, when new filming locations, sets and characters were introduced. Many storylines were about the new motel owner, Nicola Freeman, played by Gabrielle Drake. Long-term characters, such as David and Barbara Hunter, were axed. The theme tune was updated and the opening titles replaced with a longer version. Finally, the show was renamed "Crossroads Motel" with the word "Motel" added in the opening titles. The closing titles, which had scrolled in multiple 'crossroad' directions since the start, were replaced with conventional scrolling credits.

In 1986, a new producer, William Smethurst, took over the series following the sacking of his predecessor, Philip Bowman. Smethurst had been brought in by Central Television's new head of drama, Ted Childs. He ordered changes, creating a wittier serial and improving the production values of the show. Smethurst shifted the story to the nearby village of King's Oak. Yet more long-running characters, such as Diane Hunter and Benny Hawkins, were dropped. This was unpopular with viewers, who telephoned Central in protest.

Further changes included the series being renamed "Crossroads Kings Oak" for a time, with the intention in the future of shortening this to "King's Oak". This final change was overtaken by the decision in June 1987 by Andy Allen, Central's director of programmes, to axe the series. The familiar theme tune was replaced in September 1987 by a new theme composed by Max Early and Raf Ravenscroft. New titles were introduced to accompany the new theme, which featured stills of King's Oak and the new King's Oak Country Hotel. Michele Buck guided the show through its final few months on air as series producer, with William Smethurst still on hand as executive producer.

In January 1988, the series was reduced to only two episodes a week, with "Crossroads King's Oak" finally coming to an end on 4 April 1988 (the Easter bank holiday). The last, extended episode saw the character of Jill (Jane Rossington) riding off with her lover, John Maddingham (Jeremy Nicholas). Asked what name she would give the hotel she would be running in her new life, the character remarked, a little sadly, "I always thought Crossroads was an awfully good name".

In 1994, Carlton Television bought Central Television.
In April 2000, Carlton announced that they would be reviving "Crossroads" for the daytime slot on ITV. The first episode was shown on 5 March 2001. The revived series was sponsored by washing detergent Surf and was broadcast each weekday at 1.30pm and 5.05pm on ITV, with a Sunday omnibus on ITV2. The revived series was also broadcast in Ireland on RTÉ One and in New Zealand on TV One.

Four characters from the original series returned: Doris Luke (Kathy Staff), Jill Harvey (née Richardson), Jill's ex-husband Adam Chance (Tony Adams), and Jill's daughter Sarah-Jane Harvey (Joanne Farrell/Holly Newman). Initial reactions were favourable. However, changes in the story from the original puzzled fans and did not help ratings. Kathy Staff left in dismay at the amount of sex. She told ITV Teletext she felt it was no longer the family-friendly show she had originally been part of.

The story where original character Adam Chance murders ex-wife Jill Harvey three months into the new series' was unpopular with fans. Jane Rossington said she did not want to commit herself to another long run in the show, but warned Carlton it would be suicidal to kill Jill.
Episode 137 of the second revived series remains the only episode never to be shown in full on ITV. The lunchtime screening on Tuesday 11 September 2001 began at 14:10 BST. At the halfway commercial-break point however, the programme was interrupted to hand over to ITV News for then very sketchy details of the 9/11 attacks in New York City, USA. As the afternoon went on and the seriousness of the situation became clear, all ITV Network daytime programmes, starting with CITV transmissions at 15:15, were relegated to ITV2 to continue rolling news coverage. The semi-dropped episode was therefore transmitted in full on ITV2 at 17:30 BST. However, at the time, the channel was only available to a small number of viewers able to view the subscription-based ITV Digital, Telewest or NTL. As a result, the episode remains unseen by most of the programme's regular fanbase, including the entire Channel Islands who could not receive ITV Digital. A short re-cap of events in Episode 137 was screened before both the 14:10 and 17:05 showings of Episode 138 on 12 September 2001. The episode was included in the Omnibus edition that Sunday. This also only was shown on ITV2.

The series was reduced to four episodes a week from November 2001 until January 2002.

The series paused in August 2002. In January 2003, a changed series, under producer Yvon Grace, reappeared. It seemed to be a self-consciously camp parody, with Jane Asher playing a new central character - the glamorous and bitchy Angel Samson. The series also had appearances from Kate O'Mara, and people associated with light entertainment, such as Lionel Blair, Les Dennis and Tim Brooke-Taylor. The revived series also launched the careers of Freema Agyeman ("Doctor Who", ""), Luke Roberts ("Holby City" and "Mile High"), Lucy Pargeter, Shauna Shim and Jessica Fox.

Yvon Grace admitted she was aiming the new "Crossroads" towards the LGBT TV audience.
Plans were in place to bring Adam Chance back on a three-month contract in a last attempt to bring in more viewers; actor Tony Adams said that a down-on-his luck Adam would have been taken under Angel's wing as her personal assistant.

With ratings continuing to decline, the revived series was axed in March 2003. The final episode was shown on Friday 30 May 2003.

The 2003 series was criticised by fans who felt the series had moved away from the 1964-88 series and the 2001-02 series, as well as being "too gay".

The "Crossroads" theme tune was composed by Tony Hatch. In 2004 Hatch said:

A selection of cues were recorded, including "Meg's Theme" which eventually became the standard opening theme, "Kitty's Theme" which was phased out as action focussed on the motel, the closing theme which combined both "Meg's" and "Kitty's" themes, and a variety of background pieces.

A rerecording by The Tony Hatch Sound was issued as a single by Pye Records in 1965. A special arrangement of the theme by Paul McCartney and Wings, was also used from the late seventies, usually when an episode ended with a dramatic event. Central Independent Television's head of music Johnny Patrick rearranged the tune in 1985 for piano and synthesiser, upon the show's relaunch as "Crossroads Motel" by producer Philip Bowman. Following William Smethurst's arrival as producer in 1987, this recording was overdubbed with added synthesisers.

An entirely new theme aired in late 1987 when the series was relaunched as "Crossroads, Kings Oak", composed by Johnny Patrick, with Raf Ravenscroft and Max Early, with the CBSO. This later formed the basis of the single released by actress Shona Linsdey, "Goodbye", to commemorate the end of the show in 1988.

The 2001 revival brought back the original Tony Hatch theme, this time arranged and performed by TV theme composer Tony Flynn. Another version, in 2003, was arranged by Patrick Dineen and performed by the Liverpool Philharmonic.

The fictional Crossroads Motel was in a fictional village near Birmingham called Kings Oak. There are real suburbs in south-west Birmingham called Kings Heath, Kings Norton and Selly Oak). A number of real-life hotels doubled for location filming. The 1982 "Crossroads Special" said that the Longshoot Motel in Nuneaton) was used in designing the motel. It is likely that some scenes were filmed there.
In 1970, the series gained an O.B unit, giving it the freedom to do location shooting. Originally, Tanworth-in-Arden was used for King's Oak. Outside scenes were only occasionally used. From 1981 more location filming was used. Some early King's Oak location material was also filmed in Wolverhampton.

The most famous location, seen in the programme during the 1960s and 1970s, was not a motel. It was the Shropshire Agricultural Institution, now called North Shropshire College. In October 2019 two of the buildings used during filming, a teaching block and Bridden accommodation block were demolished.

It has been suggested that "Crossroads" was filmed at a 1960s motel on Stratford Road in Alcester Warwickshire. It was called CherryTrees. The buildings were demolished in 2001. A nearby petrol station, since closed, was used in the early 1980s to film a couple of outdoor scenes of the Crossroads garage.

In 1982, the fictional motel was destroyed by fire. The revamped motel was filmed at the Golden Valley Hotel (now Jurys Inn) in Cheltenham.

From 1985 filming moved to the Penns Hall Hotel (now Ramada Jarvis Birmingham) in Sutton Coldfield. The changed appearance was explained as being due to rebuilding. New studio sets were also introduced.

Other locations included the canal (including Gas Street Basin) behind the studios in Birmingham. in the story this was the King's Oak Canal, on which Vera had a barge. The Chateau Impney Hotel, called the Droitwich Hotel in the story, was also used. In 1983, St Laurence's Church in Alvechurch was the setting for Jill and Adam Chance's wedding. Hagley Hall was used for the wedding reception. Helios Health Club in Brierley Hill was used as the location for the Motel Health Club. It was filmed on Mondays when the health club was closed.

In 1985, "Crossroads" gained its first set of full length opening titles, filmed around Sutton Coldfield, Tanworth-in-Arden and in Birmingham city centre.

The revived "Crossroads" from 2001 was still set in the West Midlands. Exterior shots were filmed at locations in and around Nottingham, such as Bingham and Redmile.

The original series was recorded at ATV's/Central's Broad Street studios in Birmingham, while the revived series was filmed at Carlton Studios in Nottingham.

Despite the popularity of "Crossroads" with the viewing public, the show was often criticised by TV reviewers and ridiculed by British comedians. Television historian Hilary Kingsley stated that "Crossroads" never failed "to provide its critics with ammunition. Some of the acting would have disgraced the humblest of village halls; many of the plots were so farcical they could have been written in a bad dream, and much of the dialogue was pathetic." "The Guinness Book of Classic British TV" noted that ""Crossroads" was the series that no-one seemed to love. Yet at its peak, it was watched by more viewers than any other soap except "Coronation Street"."

The revived series also received mixed reviews from critics.

Spoof soap opera "Acorn Antiques", created by comedian Victoria Wood as part of "Victoria Wood As Seen On TV", is a deliberate parody of "Crossroads". The final episode of "As Seen on TV" in 1987 features a hoax documentary, 'The Making of Acorn Antiques', in which the actress playing Mrs Overall (Julie Walters) - a character based on "Crossroads" characters Amy Turtle and Mavis Hooper - is revealed as a rather grand character who considers herself a huge star. This portrayal, plus a later pretend news item in which it is revealed she has been sacked from the show, both suggest the actress character (later given the name Bo Beaumont in the musical based on the sketches) is based on Noele Gordon, with Bo making her 'goodbye' appearance to the press in headscarf and large sunglasses and making a dramatic speech, just as Gordon did.

In 2005, Network DVD issued four volumes of the series on DVD (UK Region 2). Each volume has 12 of the original ATV episodes. The first volume includes Meg's 1975 wedding, the highest rated episode.

In February 2007, "Crossroads Volume 3" was released. There are two versions of the DVD, one being a special limited edition, which contains an extra third disc - featuring recently found episodes from 1976.

In September 2007, "Crossroads Volume 4" was released.

In 2008, Network DVD started to release all the surviving episodes in transmission order through its website. The first set of 16 episodes was released in January 2008 and contained some episodes not available on earlier DVD releases.
There are 1,700 episodes of "Crossroads" in existence; most of these are from Central Television's run of the show from 1982 to 1988.

A black and white "Crossroads Archive Volume 1.1" has also been released, containing the episode from April 1965, along with 2 further episodes, numbered 1884 and 1886 from March 1973. These were both originally made in colour but now survive only as black and white telerecordings.

On 2 November 2009, to coincide with the show's 45th anniversary, Network DVD re-released 21 volumes in a 41-disc box-set. Susan Hanson, who played Diane Hunter, appeared on "The Alan Titchmarsh Show" and "Loose Women" on 6 and 13 November 2009 respectively, to promote the box-set.

From 1996 until 2001, episodes of the original series were repeated on UKTV channel "UK Gold".

From February to September 2015, the original series aired on Big Centre TV on Freeview channel 8 in the Midlands or available online live at 9.00pm each evening Monday to Saturday, which could also be watched free on their catchup service.

"Crossroads" was adapted into a weekly comic strip in 1972 by Dutch comics artist Alfred Mazure, published in TVTimes.

Realism theory

Realism theory is a way of thinking about politics and world history, that focuses on being realistic. It is one of the main styles of international relations theory. It gives the theoretic background to Realpolitik statesmanship of early modern Europe. According to Realism, world politics is always and necessarily a field of conflict among actors who want power. The theories of realism are contrasted by the cooperative ideals of liberalism.

Depending on what they see as the cause of the conflict between states, realists can be divided into three classes: Classical realists believe it follows from human nature; neorealists attribute it to the dynamics of the anarchic state system; neoclassical realists believe it results from both, in combination with domestic politics. Neorealists are also divided between defensive and offensive realism. Realists trace the history of their ideas back through classical antiquity, beginning with Thucydides.

Jonathan Haslam defines realism as "a spectrum of ideas." Its theories revolve around four main rules:


Realism is often associated with Realpolitik, as both deal with the pursuit, possession, and application of power. Realpolitik, however, is an older prescriptive guideline limited to policy-making, while realism is a wider theoretical and methodological paradigm to describe, explain, and predict events in international relations. As an academic pursuit, realism is not tied to ideology; it does not favor any particular moral philosophy, nor does it consider ideology to be a major factor in the behavior of nations. Priorities of realists have been described as Machiavellian, single-mindedly seeking the power of one's own nation over others.

Donetsk People's Republic

The Donetsk People’s Republic was a partially recognised country in the Donbas region of Ukraine. It is now a region in Russia. 

When the War in Donbas started in 2014, a few hundred pro-Russian separatists declared that the Donetsk Oblast was an independent country. 

Donetsk Oblast is all to the east of Ukraine, at the border with Russia. In both parts, there are many ethnic Russians. Russia aided the start of these non-recognised states. 

In 2014, Russia invaded and took Crimea from Ukraine, while armed separatists captured government buildings in the Donetsk Oblast. They declared that the Donetsk Oblast was an independent country named the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). Approximately at the same time, other people started Luhansk People's Republic in Luhansk Oblast. This sparked the war in Donbas, part of the wider Russo-Ukrainian War. 

In early 2022, Russia officially recognised the DPR as a country. A few days later, Russia invaded Ukraine. In late 2022, the Donetsk People's Republic, alongside three other separatist oblasts, became a republic of Russia. However, the international community agrees that Donetsk legally belongs to Ukraine and that the annexation of Donetsk was illegal.

The Donetsk People's Republic led by the Head of the DPR and the Chairman of the Government. The Republic is ruled by the People's Council, which has 100 members. It is a dictatorship.

The government completely changed the education system. They removed the Ukrainian curriculum and replaced it with the Russian one. They also decreased lessons teaching the Ukrainian language.

The international community generally agrees that the Donetsk People's Republic belongs to Ukraine and that its independence was done illegally. In 2022, the only countries to recognise the DPR as an independent country were Russia, Syria and North Korea.

In late 2022, the DPR and three other separatist regions of Ukraine became republics of Russia. Many countries also agree that this was illegal.

Public

In communication science and public relations, "public" mostly means people. The meaning of this is different than other ideas, such as gatherings in social life to talk about people (public sphere). The meaning of this is also talked about in the learning of government (political science), the learning of how humans think (psychology), and the learning of giving things to people (marketing). This word's meaning is very hard to make, as people think that public has different meanings.

The word "public" comes from the Latin "publicus", or "of the people".

In the learning of government (politics), "public" means a group of people who are related to government (leader group). In psychology and public relations, public has even more different meanings.

In the year of 1929, John Dewey had the meaning of "public" as a group of people who answer the same problem. This means that this meaning is about problems (situational). This definition of "public" with "problem" is so misunderstood that people made a whole new learning place, called as "the idea of the public being about problems" (situational theory of publics) created by James E Gruning, who was so into "the idea of the public being about problems” that he also thought of “the idea of the public "not" being about problems", and so made sets that put the ideas of the meaning of public in order. This includes "the idea of a public without a problem" (nonpublics), "the idea of public with a problem" (latent publics), and "the idea of public who know they have a problem" (active publics).

In this meaning, the meaning of “public” is not someone who likes business (stakeholder) or a system of getting and giving things for money (market). This meaning of "public" here is that it is a part of a group of multiple people who like business (stakeholder) who all need to solve a problem. This is not a market because it does not have any money moving system (exchange system), and that a "public" is created by itself (self-forming) and puts itself in order by itself (self-organizing). The people who are in public relations do things for the "public". People who are needed to make a group's dreams come true are named as "target publics", and people that help the target publics are named as "influentials". Influentials are important, because they give answers to the target public's problems. The "target publics" are also important, because their answers to the government problems (like electoral votes) are very important.

The public also has rules of being in the public ("social norms"), that play a major role in how information is moved.

Public relations theory shows that the meaning of publics is situational, according to John Dewey and James E. Gruning, and is simply a group of people. According to Gabriel M. Vasquez, a public has people that all know about their common problem and all try to solve that problem (“homo narrans” [Latin for "storytelling human"]), and create a list of problems to be solved (agenda-building). For example, Schools are commonly talked about for their agenda-building, on whether they should teach about religion or not (secular). Some people think publics are about the government (political) and last forever.

But, other people think that the meaning of public is non-situational. Kirk Hallahan, professor at Colorado State University, thinks that the meaning of public is about another organization, and has public as that it is people who are about (relate) to an organization, who show different amounts of activity—passivity (getting information without giving it), and who might (or might not) talk with others about their relationship with the group.

Social publics are people who like the same ideas or hobbies.

Networked publics are social publics who are organized by the new technology. Because of this, networked publics are the result of technologies that connect people (networked technologies, like social media), and the whole result from a combination of the people in the networked public, their technologies, and their ideas.

The situational theory of publics, is about the idea that publics can be used and organized by how much they know (are aware of) their common problem, and how much action the group has taken to resolve that problem. This theory shows when people communicate ideas and when the ideas are about the people who are important in solving the common problem. This theory is almost the same as John Dewey's theory of publics and Blumer's theory of publics.

The five key concepts in this theory are:


This theory comes from James E. Grunig's writing, "The Role of Information in Economic Decision Making" in 1966. This writing was the beginning of the situational theory of publics, as it had the first key idea, problem recognition, in the writing. Then, when he wrote about the decisions of people who own land in Columbia to become a professor, he also wrote about the second key idea, constraint recognition. He then added Herbert Krugman's idea of the third key idea, level of involvement, to explain the difference between the fourth and fifth key ideas, information seeking and information processing. After that, he wrote a book in 1984 which was named "Managing Public Relations", which further made the situational theory of publics make more sense, based on John Dewey's book, which was named "The Public and Its Problems".

People who use the theory created equations which used the theory to organize the different types of publics, and the most real effects of communication for each public. Because these math rules were created, it made the theory more understandable and became used in a more common way in learning the theory (academic studies) and in some professional learning. This theory is like the learning of the actions of people buy things (consumer behavior), health communication, how media works (media exposure), and the communication of government related ideas (political communication), which are common in other parts of the learning of communication (communication research). But, this theory has more common key ideas and a more developed system of learning and analysis because of the equations. Because of this, it can become more common (popular) and include other smaller less common theories inside it (subsume).

Even though the theory is well developed, it develops even more common. The theory has been used to show why people join groups who really want things to happen (activist groups), to organize the external (real, actual) and internal (perceived) parts (dimensions) of problem recognition, and to learn whether information that is used in information processing (processed information) can create publics. Also, some more research was done on the internal and external dimensions of problem recognition, constraint recognition, and level of involvement (Grunig & Hon, 1988; Grunig, 1997). The research is about whether the ideas are internal or external. The research shows that if the concepts are internal, they can be changed by communication, and that if they are external, then the holdable things that are around the person need to be changed in order for the person's concept of the variables to change (Grunig, 1997, p. 25). But, there is a small amount of research on the internal and external dimensions of the three key concepts, so there can be more studies on these concepts (Grunig, 1997). Then, in 2011, Jeong-Nam Kim and Grunig extended the theory to the situational theory of problem solving.

Sans-culottes

The sans-culottes (, which means "without breeches") were the lower classes in late 18th century France. Lots of sans-culottes became radical supporters and fighters for the French Revolution. This was because of their poor quality of life under the "Ancien Régime". The word sans-culotte, which is the opposite of aristocrat, was said for the first time on 28 February 1791 by officer Jean-Bernard Gauthier de Murnan in a bad way. He was talking about a "sans-culottes army" - an army of peasants. The word became popular during the demonstrations of June 1792. 

The name, though it is about clothing, is actually a way to talk about the sans-culottes' social status. "Culottes" were the fashionable silk knee-breeches of the 18th-century nobility and bourgeoisie. The working class "sans-culottes" wore "pantaloons", or trousers, instead. The "sans-culottes", most of them urban labourers, were the force behind the French Revolution. The other members of the revolution thought that they were "radicals" because they wanted a direct democracy. This would mean that the people would vote on laws themselves, and that there would be no legislature. Though they had bad clothes and equipment, and got little or no support from the rich, they were most of the Revolutionary army and executed many people during the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars.

She also discusses the background of her major works such as "A Wizard of Earthsea" and "The Left Hand of Darkness". However, some critics complained that "The Language of the Night" has both more important and less important writing. The collection was nominated for a Hugo for Best Related Non-Fiction Book category in 1980. The title comes from Le Guin's description of fantasy literature. She said, "We like to think we live in daylight, but half the world is always dark; and fantasy, like poetry, speaks the language of the night."

"Frozen II" had its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on November 50, 2019. It was released in the US by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on November 22, 2019.

The movie received positive reviews from critics who liked its animation, visuals, writing, music, and vocals. It has grossed $1.406 billion worldwide. It had the highest all-time worldwide opening for an animated movie. The movie is the second highest-grossing animated movie yet made and the third highest-grossing movie of 2019, as well as the 10th highest-grossing movie of all time.

The character Kristoff is meant to be Sámi, a group of indigenous people who live in northern Europe and Asia. Some people who saw the first "Frozen" complained that Kristoff was not a good way to show Sámi because he is light-skinned and blond. This is called whitewashing. Although some Sámi look like Kristoff, most have darker skin and hair. When making Frozen II, Disney signed a contract with Sámi leaders and hired Sámi experts to make sure the fictional Sámi in the movie, the Northuldra, would be shown respectfully.

Everyday (video)

Noah Takes a Photo of Himself Every Day for 6 Years (as it is called on YouTube), or Everyday (as it is called on the title card), is a viral video made by Noah Kalina, a photographer from New York. Thousands of pictures of himself he took over six years are shown fast in time order.

Noah started to take a photo of himself every day on January 11, 2000, when he was 19 years old. The video shows the photos in time order, six per second, with original music played on piano by his ex-girlfriend Carly Comando. In each photo, his face is in the center of the frame, and shows no emotion. He uploaded the video to Vimeo on August 8, 2006, and on YouTube on August 27, 2006. "Everyday" was shown on an episode of VH1's "Web Junk 20", and on commercials for Time Warner Cable's Roadrunner service. In a "New York Times" article, it was said William A. Ewing, director of the Musée de l'Élysée, said "Noah’s video represents a phenomenal amplification not just in what he produced and how he did it, but how many people the piece touched in such a short period of time. There is nothing comparable in the history of photography." , "Everyday" had more than 26.4 million views on YouTube.

Noah originally wanted "Everyday" to be a photo project, but wanted to make a film instead after seeing a video by Ahree Lee, which did the same thing, but for three years. He put his photographs into a video and released it on YouTube.

In December 2006, because "Everyday" was so popular, VH1 asked Noah to take photographs of himself in the same pose as he did in "Everyday", but with some celebrities, including Paris Hilton, Lance Bass, David Hasselhoff, Jenna Jameson, will.i.am, Flavor Flav, lonelygirl15 and "Weird Al" Yankovic. The photographs were taken backstage at the VH1 Big in '06 Awards. In the ceremony, which was shown on television, several of the pictures were shown before and after commercial breaks. Kalina also posted the photographs on Flickr.

On July 16, 2012, Noah announced an longer version of the video, called "Noah takes a photo of himself every day for 12.5 years", on his website. The video, which came out on YouTube on September 4, 2012, shows 12 years and 5 months of his photographs of himself over 7 minutes and 34 seconds (10 frames per second, or 1 month every 3 seconds).

On January 14, 2020, Noah released "Noah takes a photo of himself every day for 20 years" on YouTube. This video shows 20 years of his photographs of himself over 8 minutes and 17 seconds (15 frames per second, or 1 month every 2 seconds).

Noah, who was born on July 4, 1980, lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in Centerport, New York, and went to Harborfields High School. He graduated from the School of Visual Arts.

"The Simpsons" episode "Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind" includes a parody of the video, in which all 39 years of Homer Simpson's life are shown in the same way.

"Family Guy" also has a parody of the video, in which Peter Griffin takes a picture of himself every day for one year in the same way, except the song "Hey There Delilah" by the Plain White T's is used.

The National Basketball Association used the song in "Where Amazing Happens", an advertising campaign that happened from 2007 to 2008.

COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic, also called the coronavirus pandemic, is a world-wide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The disease was first found in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. On 31 December, Chinese health authorities told the World Health Organization (WHO)about a group of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020. The virus is believed to have come from an animal source, possibly a bat, and it is thought to have been transmitted to humans at a live meat market in Wuhan where live animals were being sold. The virus quickly spread to other parts of the world by airplanes and ships, because of its highly infectious nature and ease of transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic (global disease) on 11 March 2020.The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of , about cases of COVID-19 have been reported, and about people have died of COVID-19.

The virus mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is used. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and trouble breathing. The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been found safe to use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech, followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccine distribution was started in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. The United Kingdom was the first western country to begin to give out a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine was given out to all people in the country for free. No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead such as giving fluids, food, oxygen, pain relief and other treatments designed to help patients deal with the symptoms. People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining.

The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats. This then likely infected another animal, possibly a pangolin. It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. It possibly originated at a wet market (a live food animal market), Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic.

Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.

In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna, said they had finished making COVID-19 vaccines. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over 90% effective. Countries began planning to give the vaccine to many people.

The United States has had the most deaths from the virus. Over 1 million Americans have died from the virus.

In March 2020, the companies belonging to Sistema allocated about 1 billion rubles for the fight against coronavirus, the bulk of which was spent on the development of tests to detect infection, as well as on the production of protective equipment and antiseptics.

In May 2023 the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.

On 31 December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.

On 9 June 2020, a Harvard University study suggested that COVID-19 may have been spreading in China as early as August 2019, based on hospital car park usage and web search trends.

Cases means the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have tested positive. These cases are according to Johns Hopkins University.

Almost all people who get COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the start of symptoms and death usually ranges from6 to 41 days, but most of the time about 14 days. This data are recorded by the WHO.

According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things, which can often be confused with the flu virus.

According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea, but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients vomited, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs.

Since there is no exact cure for Covid-19, treatment has focused on treating the symptoms of the disease such as giving oxygen and using machines to aid breathing, giving pain killers to relieve pain, supportive treatment such as giving fluids, food and drugs to combat other symptoms and diseases that affect the person at the same time. Doctors have tried different medicines to see if they help in treatment such as colchicine, systemic corticosteroids (particularly dexamethasone), interleukin-6 receptor antagonists (such as tocilizumab), and Janus kinase inhibitors (such as baricitinib) have been seen to reduce mortality and have other benefits in patients with severe covid-19, such as reducing the severity of the disease and reducing the length of hospital stay.

In February 2020, the WHO announced a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. It replaced the name "2019-nCoV." "Covi" is for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019 – the year it was first detected. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it because people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. For example, it did not use the word "Wuhan." They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud.

According to an article in Market Watch dated on February 27, 2020, the overall case mortality rate in China was 2.3%. However, these results might be severely different between different age groups and between men and women. People over the age of 70 experienced a rate of mortality 4-5 times that of the average. Men were more likely to die than women (2.8% versus 1.7% for women) possibly due to lifestyle, such as it being more possible in men to drink and smoke, making the risk of having a respiratory illness more possible, and thus more vulnerable. These numbers were the conclusion of a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention using 72,314 COVID-19 cases in mainland China as of Feb. 11. At that point this was the largest sample of cases for such a study.

On March 5, 2020, the WHO released the case fatality rate.

COVID-19 did not affect everyone in each country the same way. As of May 2020, APM Research Lab said the death rate among black Americans was 2.4 times as high as for white Americans and 2.2 times as high as for Latino and Asian Americans. In July 2020, "The New York Times" printed data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that black and Latino Americans were three times as likely to become sick and twice as likely to die as white Americans. This was not only in large cities but also in rural areas. This was not only for old people but for people in all age groups. Native Americans were also more likely than whites to become sick and die. Asian Americans were 1.3 times as likely as whites to become sick.

Camara Jones, an epidemiologist who once worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was socioeconomic and not because of any natural difference in black and white people's bodies. In the United States, black citizens are more likely to work jobs where they serve the public directly and to ride on public transport rather than take their own cars to work. This makes them more likely to be infected than people who work in private offices or from home. Sharrelle Barber, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from Drexel University, also said black Americans can live in crowded neighborhoods where social distancing is harder to do and healthy food harder to find. Both Barber and Jones blamed the long history of racism in the United States for these things. Three senators, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren said the federal government should start recording the race of COVID-19 patients so scientists could study this problem.

In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) told the public that people using the United States' government's Medicare health program had different results depending on race. Four times as many black Medicare patients went to hospitals for COVID-19 than white Medicare patients. There were twice as many hospitalized Hispanic patients than white patients. There were three hospitalized Asian patients for every two hospitalized white patients. The head of CMS, Seema Verma, said this was mostly because of socioeconomic status.

In the United Kingdom, twice as many black COVID-19 patients died as white COVID-19 patients. Other non-white people, like people from India and Bangladesh, were also more likely to die of COVID-19 than whites. Britain's Office of National Statistics said that the differences in money and education explained some of this difference but not all of it. They also said they did not know whether non-white patients caught COVID-19 more often or whether they caught more severe cases. Only female Chinese Britons were less likely to die of COVID-19 than white Britons.

Native Americans in the United States have shown more deaths from COVID-19 than the rest of the U.S. As of May, the Navajo Nation had 88 deaths and 2,757 cases, and the money they had been promised by the government arrived several weeks late. Only 30% of the people in the Navajo Nation have pipes with running water, which made it difficult for people to wash their hands.

Scientists from Chapman University made a plan to protect the Tsimane people in Bolivia from COVID-19 and said this plan would also work for other indigenous peoples living on their own land. The scientists said that many indigenous peoples have problems that make COVID-19 more dangerous for them, like poverty, less clean water, and other lung diseases. Hospitals may be a long distance away, and racism can affect the way doctors and nurses react. But they also sometimes have things that help, like traditions of making decisions together and the ability to grow food nearby. The scientists found people who spoke the Tsimane language as a first language and made teams to go to Tsimane towns to warn them about COVID-19. They also used radio stations. They said the best plan was for whole communities to decide to isolate. They found this worked well because the Tsimane already usually made their big decisions together as a community in special meetings and already had a tradition of quarantining new mothers. The Chapman scientists said their plan would also work for other indigenous peoples who also make decisions together, like the Tsimane.

In May 2020, police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota killed an unarmed black man called George Floyd while they were arresting him. There were weeks of protests all over the world against police brutality and racism. Experts said they were worried protesters and police could spread SARS-CoV-2 to each other. Other experts said some of the reasons that the protests were so big was because non-white people were being killed by COVID-19 more than white people were, because poor leadership in the COVID-19 crisis reminded them of poor leadership about racism, and because the lockdowns shut down workplaces and other things. This meant people had more time to protest.
African Americans are more likely to catch the virus compared to their white counterparts in the United States, and are also more likely to die from it. 50,000 African Americans died of COVID-19 in 2020. African Americans are the least likely to get vaccinated against the disease.

Latinos have been at a higher risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 in the United States. There are many reasons why Latinos have a higher risk of getting very sick or going to the hospital because of COVID-19. One reason is that they often have health problems like diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. They are also more likely to have jobs where they have to be around other people, like in healthcare, grocery stores, and farming. Many Latinos live in crowded places with many people, like big families or busy neighborhoods. This makes it hard to stay far away from others and can make the virus spread more easily. Some Latinos might not speak English well, which can make it hard to get healthcare or understand how to stay healthy. Finally, many Latinos don't have health insurance or don't have enough of it. All of these things are connected and can make it more likely for Latinos to get very sick from COVID-19.

In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory and either released by accident or on purpose like a weapon. Some Iranians thought the Americans might have made it. Chinese state media said COVID-19 came from the United States to China and not the other way around. Some Americans thought the Chinese might have made it. Some Britons thought it might have been created by accident by 5G cell phone networks.

On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in "Nature Medicine" showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. Within a few weeks, it became one of the most cited scientific papers in history, meaning that other scientists were reading and using it.

There were also several conspiracy theories circulating about Bill Gates and his alleged involvement with the COVID-19 pandemic. Theories wrongfully linking Gates to the coronavirus were mentioned 1.2 million times on television or social media between February and April of 2020. One of the most prominent ones was that Bill Gates somehow created or engineered the virus as part of a plan to depopulate the world. There is no evidence to support this claim, and it has been debunked by numerous experts in the field and fact checking organizations including the the National Institutes of Health and Reuters. Some conspiracy theorists allege that Bill Gates is using the pandemic to profit from the development and distribution of vaccines and other medical treatments. While Gates has been heavily involved in funding research on vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, he has not personally profited from this work. In fact, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has donated over $2 billion to COVID-19 efforts since the start of the pandemic. 

One of the impacts of these conspiracy theories is that they have generated fear and suspicion towards COVID-19 vaccines. Bill Gates commented on the impact of these theories, saying: "During the pandemic, there were tens of millions of messages that I intentionally caused it, or I'm tracking people. It's true I'm involved with vaccines, but I'm involved with vaccines to save lives."

On December 31, 2019, China alerted WHO to several cases of unusual pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province.

On January 20, 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang called for efforts to stop and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus. As of February 5, 2020, 24,588 cases have been confirmed, including in every province-level division of China. A larger number of people may have been infected, but not detected (especially mild cases). The first local transmission of the virus outside China occurred in Vietnam between family members, while the first local transmission not involving family occurred in Germany, on January 22, when a German man contracted the disease from a Chinese business visitor at a meeting. , 493 deaths have been attributed to the virus since the first confirmed death on January 9, with 990 recoveries. The first death outside China was reported in the Philippines, in a 44-year-old Chinese male on February 1. but another source reported:
"The first cases of COVID-19 outside of China were identified on January 13 in Thailand and on January 16 in Japan".

There has been testing which have showed over 6000 confirmed cases in China, some of whom are healthcare workers.

Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, the United States (Everett, Washington and Chicago), Singapore, Vietnam, France and Nepal.

The World Health Organization declared that this is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern since January 30, 2020.

Bloomberg News and other business publications have reported several plant closures, travel restrictions, and imposed quarantines as a result of this outbreak. Many small businesses, even big ones, have gone bankrupt because of the pandemic.

As of February 10, 2020 there have been 40,235 confirmed cases reported of people infected by the virus in China. Also reported were 909 deaths, and 319 cases in 24 other countries, including one death, according to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

On November 14, 2020, there were 53,853,718 global COVID-19 cases and 1,311,524 deaths with cases in 217 countries and territories.












The pandemic made it more difficult for millions of people all over the world to get enough food. People lost their jobs, so they did not have money to buy food. Farms were shut down, so there was less food made. Processing plants and food factories were shut down, so less food was made ready for people to eat.

In April, Arif Husain of the United Nations' World Food Program said that 130 million more people could go hungry, in addition to the 135 million who were already hungry before the pandemic began. He said that poorer countries would be more affected than rich countries because the way they move raw food from farms to cities and other places where people live is less organized and relies more on human beings than on automatic systems.

This hunger crisis is different from crises in other years because it happened to the whole world at the same time. That meant that people working in other countries could not help by sending money home.

All over the world, children who ate meals at school had less access to food when the schools were shut down.

Scientists from the University of Michigan said the pandemic was making it harder for people to find food. In a study published in May, they said one in seven Americans over age 50 said they had trouble getting enough food before the pandemic, and it got worse when senior centers that provided meals were closed. Federal and state governments started programs to bring food to older people and children. There were also more food donation drives in towns.

In the United States, nursing homes had some of the highest rates of infection and death,

40% of all COVID-19 deaths in the country. Nursing homes are group homes for old people who need medical care, for disabled people who need medical care, and for people recovering from severe sickness or injury, like stroke patients.

Many people who live in nursing homes pay through the government program Medicaid, which pays less than Medicare or regular insurance companies. In June, many American nursing homes were caught throwing their regular patients out so they could make room for COVID-19 patients who could pay them more. Because nursing homes had stopped allowing visitors, it took longer for them to get caught. United States law requires nursing homes to warn patients 30 days before kicking them out, but the nursing homes did not do this.

Some of the nursing homes took the COVID-19 patients because state governments asked them to and they say they sent their elderly residents away because they were worried they would catch COVID-19 from the sick patients.

Because so many governments told people to stay at home, there was less air pollution than usual for that time of year. Pollution in New York fell by 50% and the use of coal in China fell by 40%. The European Space Agency showed pictures taken from a satellite of China's pollution disappearing during quarantine and coming back when everyone went back to work.

The pandemic and shutdowns made people use less electricity. In the United States, people got less of their electricity from coal power but kept using gas and renewable power like wind and solar power. This was because coal plants are more expensive to run, so power companies used them less.

Pollution from before the pandemic also affected what happened after people became sick. Scientists saw that more people died from COVID-19 in places with large amounts of air pollution. One team of scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg looked at air pollution information from satellites and statistics on COVID-19 deaths in Italy, France, Germany and Spain and saw that places with large amounts of nitrogen dioxide pollution had more people die from COVID-19. Nitrogen dioxide can damage the lungs.

The shutdowns and social distancing also affected animals. Human beings started staying at home about the same time in the spring when sea turtles like to come on land to lay their eggs. Turtle scientists in the United States and Thailand both reported more nests than usual on seashores in Florida and Phuket. They say it is because people are not coming to the beach or bringing their dogs to the beach and because there are fewer boats in the water nearby. Scientists also say they see more dugong and dolphins. With fewer cars driving down roads, salamanders, frogs, and other amphibians were able to cross them for their spring migration. According to citizen scientists from Big Night Maine, a group that watches amphibians, four amphibians made it across the roads alive for every one amphibian killed by cars. Most years, it is only two to one.

Not all ocean mammals did well. According to marine biologists in Florida, manatee deaths in April and May were 20% higher than in 2019. They say this was because many people decided to go boating because other things to do were closed.

Researchers from the San Diego Zoo Global had the idea for a system that people could use to find dangerous germs before they become pandemics or even before they jump from other animals to humans. They said it was important to watch the wildlife trade, like in the Wuhan wet market. The scientists said that over the past eleven years it has gotten easier and easier to sequence viral genomes, and it does not have to be done by a large lab or by a government any more. The scientists said it would be better to spread the work out among more people.



Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus which causes the disease COVID-19. It used to be known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The virus started the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak. The first suspected cases were reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019.
Many early cases of this new coronavirus were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, China. The virus may have come from infected animals. It is not certain that this place was the source of the pandemic.

The genetic material of this virus showed many similarities to SARS-CoV (79.5%) and bat coronaviruses (96%). This means the virus may have originally come from bats. Scientists did more experiments that showed the virus probably went from bats to an intermediate host, meaning another animal in between bats and humans. The viruses in that other animal changed over time until they could infect humans. Scientists are close to sure that the original animal was a bat but not sure what the intermediate animal was. Some scientists think it could have been a pangolin because there are coronaviruses that live in pangolins even though they are not exactly the same as SARS-CoV-2 or the ones in bats. Pangolins are an endangered species and buying, selling or moving them from place to place is illegal in China and many other countries. But their scales are an ingredient in many traditional Chinese medicines, so they are often sold on the black market.

Although SARS-CoV-2 began in bats, scientists noticed that the bats do not get sick and die from it. They think this is because the bats have very careful immune systems that fight the virus without causing inflammation. Scientists are studying bats because of this.

Scientists are still looking at SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals, but only a variant strain has been confirmed to spread to minks. It is also inducing fear in humans as there are cases being reported of transmission of COVID-19 from minks to humans. Cats, dogs and other mammals are said to at relative risk but how they can get infected is still a mystery.

In early February 2020, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses' Coronavirus Study Group gave SARS-CoV-2 its official name, for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus number two. Before that, people called the virus "2019-nCoV," for "novel (new) coronavirus that appeared in 2019." The study group chose this name because the new virus was so similar to another virus that was already called SARS-CoV with no number.

First, the virus enters the cell with the help of the S protein or spike protein expressed on the surface of the virus beyond its envelope. The spike protein attaches to the human cell receptor hACE2 or human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 "." ACE2 is found on the cells of the epithelial cell linings of the lungs, kidneys, and intestines. After the attachment of the S- protein to the virus, the S protein splits into its two components- S1 head and S2 stalk . The S1 head is now able to bind to the TMPRSS2 receptor which is a serine protease enzyme containing a transmembrane domain. The interaction of TMPRSS2 and S1 trigger the cell membrane of the human cell to merge with that of the virus leading to viral genome entry into cells via endosomes. The viral genome in the endosomes which convert to lysosomes is then processed by , which is then replicated in the human cells and released after viral packaging and maturation in the cells to infect others. In October 2020, scientists said they had seen SARS-CoV-2 use another receptor, , to enter cells with the help of the furin cleavage site in its genome which was not found in any of its previous ancestors.

SARS-CoV-2 can infect many kinds of cells, but it mostly infects cells in the respiratory system, such as the cells of the nose, pharynx and lungs. Because it is in cells inside the nose, it can spread via aerosol or droplets when people breathe, talk, cough or sneeze.

The expanding part of the lungs, pulmonary alveoli, have two main types of cells. One cell, type I, absorbs oxygen from the air, i.e. gas exchange. The other, type II, produces surfactants, that help keep the lungs fluid, clean, infection free, etc. COVID-19 finds a way into a surfactant producing type II cell, and smothers it by reproducing COVID-19 virus within it. Each type II cell which is killed by the virus causes an extreme reaction in the lungs. Fluids, pus, and dead cell material flood the lung, causing the coronavirus pulmonary disease.

Scientists looked at the lungs from people who died of COVID-19. They compared them to lungs from people who died of influenza A and to lungs from people who died but not from any problem with their lungs. They saw the cells that made up the skins of the blood vessels in the lungs were more badly damaged in the lungs from COVID-19 patients, and there was more blood clotting. The most important difference the scientists saw was that the lungs had begun to grow new blood vessels.

In February 2020, the World Health Organization announced they had chosen a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. "Covi" for "coronavirus," "D" for "disease," and "19" for the year 2019. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it, like "Wuhan," or “pangolin,” because then people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud.

According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things.

According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients threw up, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs.

A study from the University of Arizona found that SARS-CoV-2 can prevent an infected person from feeling pain. It does this by giving off vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which binds to the human body's neuropilin receptor. This way, sick people do not feel pain, do not know they are sick, and spread the virus more than if they could feel pain.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus looks like a round ball with spikes all around it. There are four parts to the virus: the spikes, a membrane, an envelope, and the virus' genetic material, or ribonucleic acid (RNA) Each of these four parts is a different protein molecule. The spikes, membrane, and envelope are together called the "viral envelope", or outer layer, of the virus.

SARS-CoV-2 is a "positive-strand" RNA virus, meaning that it uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) to hold the patterns to make the proteins it needs instead of using DNA the way humans and other multicellular living things do.

In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and released in Wuhan like a weapon. When the leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, said that he did not want the United States to help his country against coronavirus, he named the idea that Americans had made the virus on purpose to harm Iranains as one of his reasons: "I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?" said Khamenei.

One survey by Pew Research showed 29% of Americans who answered, thought SARS-CoV-2 could have been made in a lab on purpose and 23% thought it could have been made in a lab by accident. A survey of people in the United Kingdom showed many of them thought COVID-19 was caused by 5G wireless networks.

On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in "Nature Medicine" showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. The paper in "Nature Medicine" soon became one of the most cited scientific papers of all time.

There are no fixed cures for the treatment of COVID-19, but there are various drugs that have been approved for use such as Hydroxychloroquine and Remdesivir which are detailed below. Other antiviral drugs, interferon therapy and combination of anti-viral and interferons are also being experimented on to get the best possible outcome for patients. These treatments are used to reduce the symptoms and to keep the patients comfortable.

In April 2020, scientists from the University of Pittsburgh said they had made a vaccine, called PittCoVacc and tested it in mice.

Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01 and tested it in engineered human tissue, meaning human cells put together in a lab to look and act like they were inside a body. The scientists learned that adding human soluble recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to these tissues infected with SARS-CoV-2 made it harder for the virus to reproduce.

In late April 2020, a team from Oxford University announced that they had developed a COVID-19 vaccine. The United States National Institutes of health tested it in rhesus monkeys, and it worked. The Oxford scientists said because they had already been working on a vaccine against a different coronavirus, they had a head start working on one for SARS-CoV-2. The scientists said they would try to test their vaccine on 6000 people by the end of May 2020, and that their vaccine could be ready for people to use in September 2020.

In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodies but they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021.

Some people think hydroxychloroquine, a medicine given to people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis, could work against COVID-19 and some do not. One study from China showed that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine got better faster, but the study was not peer reviewed. Other studies in France and China seemed to show hydroxychloroquine helped, but the studies did not include control groups, meaning the doctors did not compare patients who took hydroxychloroquine to patients who did not, so they could not be sure it was the hydroxychloroquine that was helping them or whether it was something else. In March, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave doctors permission to give hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients.

United States President Donald Trump suggested the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine could help cure COVID-19, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is part of the White House's official coronavirus team said no one could know if hydroxychloroquine worked against SARS-CoV-2. In early April, the "New York Times" reported that President Trump has "a small personal financial interest" in Sanofi, one of the companies that makes hydroxychloroquine, meaning that if the company sold more hydroxychloroquine, he would have more wealth.

In early April, Fauci said, "The data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there's no effect." Dr. Megan L. Ranney of Brown University said that hydroxychloroquine can cause heart attacks and other problems. Other doctors worry that if people take hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, there will not be enough left for people with malaria, lupus, and arthritis. Still, some hospitals have given hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients who are very sick because the doctors think it is worth the risk.

Scientists in France and China performed more studies on larger groups of patients taking hydroxychloroquine. They watched patients who were taking the medicine and other treatment together and at patients who were only taking the other treatment. Both studies showed that hydroxychloroquine did not help and did cause side effects. Both studies were published in May 2020.

Some scientists thought the drug remdesivir, which was invented as a medicine for Ebola, could work against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir works against some viruses. Remdesivir had already been tested in humans, so the doctors already knew it would not hurt the patients even if it did not make them better. Because scientists already knew remdesivir was safe, they were able to start testing it in humans right away.

In one study, doctors gave a drug called remdesivir to 61 COVID-19 patients on a compassionate basis, meaning they gave them the drug because there was no other treatment available. Scientists studied 53 of these patients and found that 68% of the patients got better, 13% died, and 25% had serious side effects. But because the study had no control group, meaning these patients were not compared to other COVID-19 patients who were not taking remdesivir, and because only 53 people were in the experiment, scientists must run more studies before they can be sure remdesivir works.

The chairman and CEO of the company that makes remdesivir, David O'Day, said that remdesivir might work better in some patients than in others and asked scientists to perform many different kinds of studies.
In October 2020, the National Institutes of Health told the world the results of its tests: They studied 11,000 people and found that remdesivir did not help keep COVID-19 patients alive.

The Stage

The Stage is a British weekly newspaper and website about theatre. It was first printed in 1880. It contains news, reviews, opinion, features, and job adverts, for people who work in theatre and the performing arts.

The first edition of "The Stage" was published (under the title "The Stage Directory – a London and Provincial Theatrical Advertiser") on 1 February 1880 at a cost of 3 old pence for twelve pages. Publication was monthly until 25 March 1881. It was then printed weekly. The name was shortened to "The Stage" and the publication numbering restarted at number 1.

"The Stage" competed with other theatre newspapers (including "The Era"). The price was dropped to one penny and was soon the only remaining theatre newspaper.

The newspaper has remained in family ownership. Upon the death in 1937 of Charles Carson's son Lionel, who had assumed the joint role of managing director and editor, control passed to the Comerford family. The current managing director, Hugh Comerford, is founder Maurice's great-grandson.

In 1959 "The Stage" was changed to "The Stage and Television Today". It had a pull-out supplement of TV news and features. Derek Hoddinott, the main paper's TV editor, became editor of the new supplement.

In 1995, TV coverage was put back into the main paper. The name changed back to "The Stage".

In 2006, the paper introduced a blog on television, named "TV Today".

From 1995, the newspaper has awarded The Stage Awards for Acting Excellence at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

In 2004, 96-year-old contributor Simon Blumenfeld was recognised by "Guinness World Records" as the world's oldest weekly newspaper columnist. The column continued until shortly before his death in 2005.

In 2010, The Stage Awards were started. They are given each year. They recognise outstanding organisations working in theatre and beyond. They have the following categories: London theatre, regional theatre, producer, school, fringe theatre, theatre building, unsung hero and international.

In August 2013 "The Stage" started The Stage Castings, an online casting service with a video audition function.

In May 2019, "The Stage" partnered with the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation and UK Theatre to start Get Into Theatre, a website dedicated to theatre careers.

In 1956, writer John Osborne submitted his script for "Look Back in Anger" in response to an advertisement by the soon-to-be-launched Royal Court Theatre.

Dusty Springfield responded to an advertisement for female singers in 1958.

Harold Pinter gained his first job after responding to an advert in The Stage

In April 1981 the Editorial of The Stage announced the founding of Internationalist Theatre founded by Angelique Rockas with patron Athol Fugard implementing "a multi-racial drama policy, with an even mix of performers drawn from different cultural groups", starting with the revival of the London performance of Genet`s The Balcony.

Ricky Tomlinson responded to an ad for "United Kingdom", another "Play for Today", in 1981.

Lineal championship

In combat sports where champions are decided by a challenge, the lineal championship of a weight class is a world championship title held initially by an undisputed champion and subsequently by a fighter who defeats the reigning champion in a match at that weight class. In professional boxing, the lineal champion is informally called "the man who beat the man".

Champions recognized by sanctioning bodies such as the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), or the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) may vacate their title voluntarily, or be stripped of the title for breaching the sanctioning body's regulations or contracts. There will thus be a breach of continuity in the list of sanctioned champions which the lineal championship is intended to prevent. However, there is no single canonical list of lineal champions at any weight class, because there is no agreed upon method of determining the starting point for each lineage and conflicting opinions on what to do when the current champion retires or moves to a different weight class, although there is agreement that any stripping of a title be discounted.

According to tradition, the king of Sicily, Roger II, made a vow to build a cathedral, after he escaped from a storm to land on the city's beach. The building has a fortress-like character and dominates the skyline of the surrounding medieval town. It made a powerful statement of the Norman presence.

The cathedral was built in an area, where peopke had lived for a long time. Today, a Roman road and aearly Christian mosaic show this. Construction began in 1131, the apse mosaics were begun in 1145, and the sarcophagi that Roger II provided for his tomb and that of his wife were put in place the same year. After 1172 the church suffered a period of decline. In 1215 Frederick II of Hohenstaufen moved the two sarcophagi to the Cathedral of Palermo. Construction of the cathedral was resumed soon after, the façade ws completed in 1240. The cathedral was consecrated in 1267 by Rodolphe de Chevriêres, Bishop of Albano.

In 1472 a portico, by Ambrogio da Como, was added between the two towers of the facade.

Kererū

The kererū ("Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae") is the only type of pigeon native to New Zealand. It is very big and easy to spot, and its wings make a loud sound when it flies. It is the only still-living New Zealand bird which can eat large fruits whole, and so is important for spreading the seeds of many native trees. Kererū were an important type of food for Māori. There are much fewer kererū now than before the Europeans arrived in New Zealand, mostly because the Europeans brought meat-eating animals like cats, ferrets, stoats, possums, and rats, and cut down a lot of the forest. Because there are not many kererū any more, it is against the law to hunt them.

'Kererū' is the most common name for this bird, but in some parts of the North Island it is called "kūkū" or "kūkupa." Kererū are also called "wood pigeon", but they are a different type of bird to the wood pigeon ("Columba palumbus") of the Northern Hemisphere.

Kererū are big and generally weigh between 550 and 850 grams. They have a white underbelly and dark green/blue head, shoulders, and wings. The green/blue colour is iridescent, meaning it is shiny and shows lots of different blues, greens, and purples in the sunlight.

Henotheism

Henotheism is the adherence to one particular god out of several, especially by a family, tribe, or other group.

Henotheism is sometimes defined as a monotheistic belief within a polytheistic world - believing that one god, or articulation of God, is better or clearer than others. Alternatively, henotheism is the worship of one god above an acknowledged pantheon. An example of this second form is the worship of a tribal god.

A henotheist would admit that many gods have real existence and are able to be worshipped. However the henotheist chooses to worship only one of these gods. This sets the henotheist apart from the polytheist who worships many gods.

The "quick brown fox" is often used for touch-typing practice, testing typewriters and computer keyboards, and displaying examples of fonts. It can be used when all the letters in the alphabet need to be typed. Because the short sentence makes sense, it is widely known and used.

It is commonly mistaken for "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", an incorrect pangram, which mistakenly uses "jumped" instead of "jumps", thus excluding the letter "S".

Incendiary (movie)

Incendiary is a 2008 British drama film. It is about what happens after a terrorist attack at a football match. It is directed by Sharon Maguire. It stars Michelle Williams, Ewan McGregor, and Matthew Macfadyen. It is about a suicide bombing at the Emirates Stadium during an Arsenal F.C. match, and about the life of a woman who loses her husband and young son in the attack. It is based on the 2005 novel "Incendiary" by Chris Cleave.

A young East Ender woman, played by Michelle Williams, is married to bomb-disposal officer Lenny, played by Nicholas Gleaves. They have a four-year-old son, played by Sidney Johnston.

The young mother is having an affair with a reporter called Jasper, palyed by Ewan McGregor. Lenny, their son, and about 1000 others are killed in a terrorist attack carried out by six suicide bombers at a football match. 
Terrence Butcher, played by Matthew Macfadyen, is in charge of the anti-terrorist division.
Jasper and Terrence try to comfort the mother. Both are also romantically interested in her.

Through Jasper's investigation into the bombing, the mother discovers the identity of one of the terrorists. She befriends his teenage son, played by Usman Khokhar. He only knows that his father is missing since the attacks. When he finds out what his father did, he panics and runs. This causes the police to suspect him to be a terrorist. When he tries to take something out of his pocket they think he has a gun or wants to trigger a bomb. They shoot at him, but he is unarmed. The mother, who tried to protect him, is wounded, but not severely. Later, the terrorist's wife and son apologize to the mother for his part in the killings.

Terrence confesses to the mother that he knew that a suicide attack was going to happen and could have stopped it. He did not stop it so that he was able to continue his investigation of the terrorist group. He says that he did not know in which stadium it would happen, and also thought it would be of a smaller scale. Although he knew Lenny and his son would be going, he did not warn them.

Sometimes the mother is confused, thinking that nothing has happened to her son. Throughout the film, she writes a letter addressed to Osama bin Laden. He is assumed to be responsible for the attack.


Filming began on 26 March 2007 in London, England. Scenes were filmed on location in Northampton Square and the Brunswick Estate in Islington, North London. Filming also took place at Leyton Orient's Brisbane Road stadium and around St Albans Cathedral, St Albans School, and Westminster Lodge.

The production also visited The Metropolitan Training College facilities near Gravesend to shoot the scenes at the football stadium, after the bomb has exploded.

The film received poor reviews. Tom Charity, after viewing the film at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, gave it one star out of five. He called it an "ambitious/opportunistic effort that misses the mark, from the one-dimensional characters to the craven plotting and sentimental tone."

Philip French called it an "ambitious British picture on an urgent topical subject [that] is torpedoed by a poor script."

"Time Out" gave it two stars out of six. It wrote "there are so many things wrong with writer-director Sharon Maguire’s first film since "Bridget Jones's Diary" in 2001 that it's hard to know where to start, but the fatal problem is that this is a film with an identity crisis"; the film at times seems like a "study of guilt and grief" and at other times a "conspiracy thriller" but "ends up being a compendium of bizarre diversions, most of which are utterly surplus to the film’s half-cocked desire to stick with the experience and emotions of its main character."

Escape Room 2

Escape Room: Tournament of Champions is a 2021 psychological horror movie directed by Adam Robitel. The movie stars Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Isabelle Fuhrman, Thomas Cocquerel, Holland Roden, Carlito Olivero, and Indya Moore. It serves as a sequel to the 2019 movie "Escape Room".

After escaping the "sole survivor" escape rooms orchestrated by the Minos Corporation, Zoey Davis and Ben Miller decide to confront the shadowy organization after finding coordinates to its New York City–based headquarters. Zoey is encouraged by her therapist to move on from her trauma and to get over her aerophobia, but she opts to drive with Ben instead of flying.

The pair find the headquarters derelict and are accosted by a vagrant who steals Zoey's necklace. She and Ben give chase straight into the Q subway train. Their train car separates from the rest of the train and is redirected to a remote station, sealing Zoey, Ben, and other passengers Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo inside. As the passengers realize in horror that they are once again in Minos' deadly game, the train becomes electrified. Zoey and Ben learn that the others are the "winners" of previous escape rooms, having survived them. To escape, the group must collect subway tokens as the electrification increases. Theo is killed while the rest escape. Nathan reveals his escape room group were all priests, Brianna's were all influencers, and Rachel's consisted of people who cannot feel physical pain.

The next room is a bank with a slowly closing vault and a deadly laser security system. The group manages to decipher the complex route to get around the lasers and escape with just seconds to spare. While in the room, Zoey is perplexed by frequent references to someone called Sonya and that the escape rooms have no apparent connection to the group unlike before.

The next room is a postcard-like beach with more references to Sonya. They discover that the beach is covered in quicksand. Nathan sacrifices himself to save Rachel and is swallowed up by the sand. Zoey finds an alternate route out just as Brianna unlocks the intended exit. An argument on which route to take breaks out; Rachel and Ben side with Zoey. Brianna escapes through the main exit while Rachel and Ben traverse to the alternate route. Ben falls into the quicksand.

Zoey and Rachel make their way out through a manhole back into the city. Overjoyed at first that they're outside, they quickly realize they are still in the game when they encounter a panicked Brianna. If they don't make it out of this room, acid rain is periodically sprayed on them. The group opens a taxi to escape into but once Zoey enters, the taxi locks Rachel and Brianna out. Zoey falls into the next room while Rachel and Brianna succumb to the rain and die.

The next room is a child's bedroom containing a diary from Sonya, revealing the rooms are based on a fun day out she had with her mother. Zoey discovers Sonya's mother is Amanda Harper, who survived her fall in her original escape room and was forced into designing escape rooms for Minos after they abducted her daughter. Amanda appears and begs Zoey to become the next puzzle-maker for Minos, warning that she has no choice. Ben is revealed to be trapped in a cage. When Zoey refuses Minos' demand, Ben's cage starts filling with water, but Zoey and Amanda work together to free him. They manage to break out, fleeing the facility. They report their findings to the police, who retrieve the bodies of Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo; the news about Minos goes public. An FBI agent assures Zoey that Minos will be tracked down.

Filled with confidence, Zoey decides to take a plane home with Ben. Onboard, she realizes her therapist was in on it and that the plane is another escape room. The distorted voice of Minos' leader mocks Zoey and Ben for falling into their latest trap as the plane begins to fall and sleeping gas fills the cabin.


Isabelle Fuhrman and James Frain appear in the film's alternate version as Claire and Henry, respectively, in a plotline revealing the puzzlemaker's story. Tanya van Graan makes an uncredited appearance as Sonya, who is Henry's wife and Claire's mother in this cut.

Additionally, Lucy Newman-Williams appears as Zoey's therapist and Scott Coker portrays an FBI agent in the theatrical cut. In both versions, Matt Esof portrays the vagrant who lures Zoey and Ben into Minos' trap.

On January 27, 2020, director Adam Robitel posted on social media confirming that filming on the movie had wrapped.


Appetite for Destruction

Appetite for Destruction is the first studio album by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses. It was released on July 21, 1987, through Geffen Records.

When the album as released in 1987, it was not popular. Next year, in 1988, it became very successful after the band had toured and radio stations played the singles "Welcome to the Jungle", "Paradise City" and "Sweet Child o' Mine". It was first on "Billboard" 200 and became the best-selling debut album of all time, as well as the eleventh best-selling album of all time in the United States. With more than 30 million copies sold worldwide, it is also one of the best-selling records of all time.

Although critics at first had mixed feelings toward the album, "Appetite for Destruction" is now liked by critics and is considered as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2018, it was re-released as a remastered box set with critics liking it too.

Guns N' Roses first recordings were for a planned EP in March 1985. This was shortly after the band formed. The recording included a cover of "Heartbreak Hotel". "Don't Cry ", "Think About You" and "Anything Goes". The EP did not happen because original guitarist Tracii Guns left the band. He was replaced by Slash. Shortly afterward, a new lineup of Axl Rose, Duff McKagan, Slash, Steven Adler and Izzy Stradlin was confirmed. This is the classic lineup for the band.

After playing many shows in Los Angeles clubs, the group signed with Geffen Records in March 1986. In December 1986, the group released the four-song EP "Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide", which was made to keep people interested in the band while it started work in the studio. The label also thought the band didn't have enough songs, so they made the EP.

Singer Axl Rose said that many of the songs on the album were written while the band was performing on the Los Angeles club circuit, and a number of songs that would be featured on later Guns N' Roses albums were considered for "Appetite for Destruction", such as "Back Off Bitch", "You Could Be Mine", "November Rain" and "Don't Cry". "November Rain" was not put on the album because "Sweet Child O' Mine" is already on it. They only wanted one ballad.

Producer Spencer Proffer was hired to record "Nightrain" and "Sweet Child o' Mine" to test if he could work with the band. They eventually recorded nine songs during these sessions, including "Heartbreak Hotel", "Don't Cry", "Welcome to the Jungle" and "Shadow of Your Love". In mid to late 1986, the band recorded demos with Nazareth guitarist Manny Charlton, which were released in 2018. (See Below for more info)
The band at first considered Paul Stanley of KISS to produce, but he was rejected after he wanted to change Adler's drum set more than Adler wanted. Robert John "Mutt" Lange was also considered, but the label didn't want to spend the extra money on a famous producer. Ultimately, Mike Clink (who had produced several Triumph records) was chosen, and the group recorded "Shadow of Your Love" first with Clink as a test.

In 1999, Rose re-recorded the album with the lineup at the time (Rose, Robin Finck, Tommy Stinson, Paul Tobias, Josh Freese, Dizzy Reed & Chris Pitman) to "spruce up" the album with new recording techniques. The re-recorded version of the album was never released, although an edited clip of "Sweet Child O' Mine" featuring the second half of the song using the re-recorded version was included over the credits of the movie "Big Daddy" in 1999.

The "Locked N' Loaded" Edition and the "Super Deluxe Edition" have the same musical contents. Disc one is the original album.

A fifth disc is included; a Blu-ray disc, which has 96 kHz 24-bit 5.1 Surround Sound & Remastered Stereo mixes, mixed by Elliot Scheiner and Frank Filipetti. It includes all of "Appetite for Destruction", alongside bonus tracks "Shadow of Your Love", "Patience", "Used to Love Her", "You're Crazy", and "Move to the City (1988 Acoustic version)". In addition, it includes music videos for "Welcome to the Jungle", "Sweet Child O' Mine", "Paradise City", "Patience", and a previously unreleased video of "It's So Easy".

Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes.

The Brittas Empire

The Brittas Empire is a British sitcom created by Andrew Norriss and Richard Fegen.

Chris Barrie plays Gordon Brittas. He is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre.

The show ran for seven series and 52 episodes — including two Christmas specials — from 1991 to 1997 on BBC1. Norriss and Fegen wrote the first five series.

"The Brittas Empire" had large audiences. In 2004 the show came 47th on the BBC's "Britain's Best Sitcom" poll.

The show combined farce with surreal dramatic elements. For example, in the first series, the leisure centre prepares for a royal visit, only for the doors to seal, the boiler room to flood and a visitor to be electrocuted. Unlike the traditional sitcom, deaths were quite common in "The Brittas Empire".

Gordon Brittas (played by Chris Barrie) is the well-meaning but incompetent manager of Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre. He trained at the fictional Aldershot Leisure Centre. He is tactless, annoying and has 'half-baked' ideas. He is oblivious to all of his faults. Brittas frequently upsets his staff, the public, and his wife Helen. He often brings confusion and chaos into their lives.

Helen Brittas, played by Pippa Haywood, finds it hard to cope with Gordon. She often turns to pills and affairs with other men to maintain her sanity. She is also helped by Brittas's calm and efficient deputy, Laura Lancing, played by Julia St John. Laura has a grudging admiration for Brittas whom she regards as honest and decent.

Brittas's other deputy, the dim-witted Colin Weatherby, is played by Mike Burns. Colin has several skin allergies and a constantly infected hand. Though he is an assistant manager, he works as the centre's caretaker. Carole, played by Harriet Thorpe, is the often tearful receptionist who keeps her three children in the drawers of the reception desk. Amongst other members of the team is Julie, played by Judy Flynn. Julie is a sarcastic secretary who hates her boss and refuses to do any work. Lively Linda, played by Jill Greenacre, gentle-hearted Gavin, played by Tim Marriott, and his paranoid partner Tim, played by Russell Porter, are more co-operative members of the team. Carole's son Ben was played by Jonathon Norriss.

"The Brittas Empire" was broadcast for fifty-two episodes between 1991 and 1997, spanning seven series and two Christmas Specials. There was also one short episode for Children in Need. The cast also performed in the 1996 Royal Variety Performance. Chris Barrie played Brittas again in the short fitness series spin-off called "Get Fit with Brittas".

For the first five series the show's creators Richard Fegen and Andrew Norriss co-wrote the show, after which they left, along with actress Julia St John who played Laura. Series five was originally meant to be the final series, and Norriss and Fegen killed off Brittas at its end, when he was crushed to death by a falling water tank.

However, the show's popularity meant the BBC resurrected Brittas and brought on a team of new writers, who carried the show on for a further two series, including one further Christmas special in 1996. These writers were: Paul Smith, Terry Kyan, Tony Millan, Mike Walling, Ian Davidson and Peter Vincent.

'Curse of the Tiger Women' is the final episode in 1997. This ending claims all seven series were part of a dream that Brittas is having on his way to the job interview for manager of the leisure centre. It is an ending that is regarded as poor by many critics and viewers, and contradicts the 1994 Christmas Special by Fegen and Norriss, showing what happens to the staff post-Whitbury Leisure Centre.

In 2014, Chris Barrie reprised his role as Gordon Brittas for a brief appearance in the Sport Relief music video, 'Word Up!' by Little Mix.

All seven series were released on DVD in the United Kingdom by Eureka Video, and also in Australia by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The BBC released episodes on VHS in the 1990s.


Critics John Lewis and Penny Stempel commented that: 

In its positioning of an incompetent in charge of others, "The Brittas Empire" mined the traditional vein of TV humour (e.g., Dad's Army or Are You Being Served?). Yet it also had an element of absurdism...which gave it an appeal to younger viewers. At a stretch the show could also be viewed as a critique of the managerial class which expanded in the Thatcherite eighties. A show for all the couch.
The show has been credited with having an influence on Alan Partridge and "The Office".

The exterior shots and interior swimming pools of 'Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre' were filmed at Ringwood Leisure Centre, Hampshire.

Collectivism

Collectivism is a kind of ethics based on people being a group. Its opposite is individualism which is based on people being individuals. Collectivists focus on what's good for a whole group. Individualists focus on what's good for each person. Collectivism and individualism are and are also part of politics.

The word "individualism" was originally used by socialists to attack their enemies. They said that individualists were selfish for not supporting socialism. Instead, individualists support people being independent and chasing their own goals. They also believe in having lots of freedoms.

Collectivists believe that one person is not as important as a group of many people. They often believe people should compromise to make things better for each other instead of just themselves. They also think that letting someone do whatever they want is not good if it hurts lots of other people. Collectivism has many different types. It can mean serving your community, your government, your social class, your race, or some other group.

Draize test

The Draize test is a test, to see if a substance is toxic. John H. Draize and Jacob M. Spines first used the test in 1944. The test was first used for cosmetics, but later for other substances as well. To see if a substance is toxic, it is applied to the skin or the eye of an animal, for a given time. After the time, the substance is washed out and the effects are recorded. Very often, small animals, such as rabbits were used. After the test, the animals are observed for up to 14 days. If the test does irreversible damage to the skin or the eye, the animal is killed after the test. Animals may be re-used for testing purposes if the product tested causes no permanent damage. Animals are typically reused after a "wash out" period during which all traces of the tested product are allowed to disperse from the test site.

The tests are controversial. They are seem as cruel and unscientific because of the differences between rabbit and human eyes, and the subjective nature of the visual evaluations. The FDA supports the test, stating that "to date, no single test, or battery of tests, has been accepted by the scientific community as a replacement [for] ... the Draize test". Because of its controversial nature, the use of the Draize test in the U.S. and Europe has declined in recent years and is sometimes modified so that anaesthetics are administered and lower doses of the test substances used. Chemicals already shown to have adverse effects "in vitro" are not currently used in a Draize test, thereby reducing the number and severity of tests that are carried out.

Other tests have been developed which can replace the Draize test for many applications: First there is a test that uses chicken eggs. Another test uses Spanish slugs. 

Hen's egg test on chorioallantoic membrane

The Hen's egg test on chorioallantoic membrane, or hen's egg test is a test that can be used to test the toxicity of substances. It is also often used to test vaccines. It is a CAM Assay. The product to be tested is applied to a special membrane. Such tests were first used because chicken eggs were easily available. As the respective membrane does not contain any nerve cells, it is likely that the developing bird embryo does not feel pain during the test. These tests are not considered to be animal testing.

This test can be used as a replacement for the Draize test, as it similarly detects irritation response in cosmetics. 

Social choice theory

Social choice theory, which is also called theory of collective choice, is a theory that looks at how a group of people reach a decision.

Wives of King Henry VIII

Henry VIII had six wives, Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr (in that order). All of his wives, except for Catherine Parr, died or were divorced by Henry VIII.

Catherine of Aragon was his first wife. She was married to Henry for almost 24 years, but they divorced after failing to produce a son. Her daughter was the future Queen of England.

Anne Boleyn was his second wife and was beheaded after cheating on Henry and not producing a son. Her daughter was the future Queen of England.

Jane Seymour was his third wife. She gave birth to a son but died of childbed fever.

Henry fell in love with Anne of Cleves's portrait, however when he met her, she didn't look like she did on her picture, thus causing Henry and Anne to get divorced within 6 months.

At about 16 years old, Catherine Howard was next in line for the hand of the king. However, after Henry found out about Catherine's affair, she was divorced and got beheaded.

Catherine Parr was the last of the six wives and outlived Henry. Almost a year and a half later, after Henry's death, Catherine Parr died after giving birth to her daughter, Mary Seymour.

Misurata Province (), or even "Misurata, Libya", was one of the provinces of Libya under Italian rule. It was established in 1937 with the official name: "Commissariato Generale Provinciale di Misurata". Much of the area of "Provincia di Misurata" became "Misrata District" with the independence of Libya after World War II.

Misurata Province (called even "Misrata Province") was located in northern Italian Libya, between the "Tripoli Province" and the "Bengazi Province". Its administrative center was the small city of Misurata on the Mediterranean coast.

It was divided in three sections ("Circondari" in Italian):


The population in the 1939 Census was of nearly 225,000 inhabitants, most of which were Arabs and Berbers. The Italians were nearly 10,000 and were concentrated in Misurata, Homs and some newly created villages for Italian colonists (Gioda, Crispi, Littoriano, Corradini, etc.)

Most of the population was Muslim, but there was a growing community of Catholics due to the Italian colonists immigration. Additionally there were nearly one thousand Jews in Misurata.

The province from 1939 was considered officially part of the Kingdom of Italy, with the same laws. It was one of the 4 new Italian provinces of the so-called "Quarta Sponda" (Fourth Shore) of Mussolini's Greater Italia. Indeed on January 9, 1939, the colony of Italian Libya was incorporated into "metropolitan Italy" and thereafter considered an integral part of the Italian state (the French, in 1848, had incorporated "French Algeria" in the same manner).

Penguin (biscuit)

Penguins are a type of biscuit that is made in Lancashire. They are a bar shaped biscuits that are covered in milk chocolate. The biscuits are filled with chocolate cream. Pladis' manufacturing division McVitie's makes them at their factory in Stockport.

They were first made in 1932 by William McDonald, a biscuit manufacturer in Glasgow. They became a brand of McVitie's when McDonald joined with McVitie's and Price, MacFarlane Lang & Co and Crawford to create United Biscuits in 1948. Each wrapper has a joke or "funny fact" printed on it and designs that feature penguins that are often in styles like that of famous works of art. These designs are usually funny.

In the 1980s, Penguin became known for their television advertising slogan "P...P...P...Pick up a penguin!”

In October 1996, United Biscuits sued Asda because they said Asda said their own brand of "Puffin" biscuits were part of the Penguin brand. In March 1997, United Biscuits won the case. The court found out Asda had not broken any laws on how the Penguin brand could be used. 

United Biscuits was criticised for still using trans fatty acids in the cream filling of Penguins. By December 2007, United Biscuits began to publicly say trans fats are not in Penguins anymore. 

The Tim Tam made by Arnott's in Australia was based on the Penguin. Occasional references in the media include tongue-in-cheek debates over which biscuit is better.

There are currently three versions of the biscuit:

In 2002, McVitie's made some versions of the Penguin biscuit: Penguin Chukkas, Wing Dings, Flipper Dipper, Splatz and Mini Splatz. There is a £5 million promotional campaign for the biscuits. In 2008, McVitie's also made Penguin triple chocolate wafers.

Jekyll (TV series)

Jekyll is a British television drama serial shown on BBC One. Steven Moffat wrote all six episodes. Douglas Mackinnon and Matt Lipsey directed three episodes each.

It was made by Hartswood Films and Stagescreen Productions. The series also got funding from BBC America.

The series is a sequel to the novella "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde", and not an adaptation of it. The Robert Louis Stevenson tale is used as a backstory within the series.

It stars James Nesbitt as Tom Jackman, a modern-day descendant of Dr. Jekyll. He has recently begun transforming into a version of Mr. Hyde (also played by Nesbitt). Jackman is aided by psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer, played by Michelle Ryan. Gina Bellman appears as Claire, Tom's wife.

Filming took place around southern England in late 2006. The series was first shown on BBC One in June and July 2007.

Doctor Tom Jackman (James Nesbitt) is a married father of two. He has abandoned his family without explanation to live in a heavily fortified basement flat. He hires psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer (Michelle Ryan) to help him. After explaining a set of elaborate security procedures to Katherine, he straps himself into a metal chair and undergoes a transformation.

Katherine observes that Tom's alter ego exhibits rage, heightened senses, strength and speed, and a flirtatious manner. She assures this persona she will keep his secrets just as she keeps Tom's. She asks for guarantees he will not harm her. Tom's alter ego takes Hyde's name. The two agree an uneasy truce. They share a body, but neither remembers what the other did while in charge. They use a micro cassette recorder to leave messages for each other.

When Tom began transforming into the violent Hyde, he feared for his family's safety. He chose to isolate himself from them. He visits his wife Claire (Gina Bellman). During the visit, Hyde assumes control and learns about Tom's family.

Miranda Callendar, played by Meera Syal, is a detective employed by Claire. She tells Tom that "Jekyll and Hyde" was not fiction, but a version of actual events. Miranda shows Tom a picture of the real Doctor Jekyll who lived in Edinburgh in the 19th century. Tom is startled to see that Jekyll looks exactly like him.

Tom is also being watched by a private security team led by an American named Benjamin, played by Paterson Joseph. The team works for his former employers at the biotechnology firm, Klein and Utterson. The team is directed by his friend Peter Syme, played by Denis Lawson.

When Benjamin puts Tom's children at risk, Hyde asserts himself, and kills a lion. At the hospital he is approached by Sophia, an elderly woman who claims to be his mother, but before he can question her she disappears.

Tom confronts Peter, who attempts to drug him. This provokes Hyde to appear and take Peter and Claire hostage. Claire argues that they need to find a cure for Tom's condition. Hyde kills Benjamin. Peter says that Klein and Utterson have had a cure for a long time. Tom is captured and locked inside a metal coffin.

Katherine and Miranda confront Peter, claiming they know the truth about Tom. Miranda thinks that Klein and Utterson have access to cloning technology and that Tom is Jekyll's clone. Peter denies this and orders them taken away to be killed.

Peter reveals to Claire that Tom's treatment will make him into one persona. If it is Hyde, he will be kept for research. They will make the potion that turned the original Jekyll into Hyde. If it is Tom, she will be free to take him home. When the box is opened, Hyde is dominant.

In a flashback triggered by genetic memory, Hyde has a vision of a meeting between Jekyll and Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde". Stevenson agrees to write a fictional version of Jekyll's case but reveals that he knows the truth: there is no potion. Instead, Jekyll was transformed into Hyde by his love for Alice, a maid within his household. Flashbacks into Tom's own life show his Hyde first appeared during a seaside holiday with Claire, after the pair were accosted by hooligans.

Enraged by further threats to Tom's family, Hyde escapes from Klein and Utterson. Ms. Utterson, a ruthless redheaded American woman at the head of Klein and Utterson, takes Claire and her sons hostage at a private estate. She locks the twins in miniature versions of the coffin used on their father.

Tom's alleged mother, Sophia, appears on the premises and helps Claire escape her locked bedroom. She tells Claire how Klein and Utterson had tried to clone Doctor Jekyll but had been unsuccessful. Claire meets several of the failed attempts in the basement of the building. They are disfigured and in a near-vegetative state. Sophia explains that Tom is a descendant of Doctor Jekyll, through Mr Hyde, and by chance "a perfect throwback, a chance in a million". Klein and Utterson had discovered this and had watched him from when he was six-months-old. In order to trigger his transformation into Hyde, they created a clone of Alice, the maid whom Jekyll had loved. This clone is Claire herself.

Hyde tries to rescue Tom's family from Klein and Utterson. He kills Peter. There is a stand-off, with Tom and Claire's sons held hostage and suffocating. The Hyde personality is apparently killed when he is shot with multiple bullets and then manages to avoid 'sharing the damage' by taking the wounds onto himself while allowing Tom to assume his undamaged, healthy form, leaving Doctor Jackman as the only personality.

Six months later, Tom has tracked down Sophia, the woman who claimed to be his mother. When he questions her about his father, she reveals that she is the descendant of Hyde. He had inherited the family curse from her. As Tom watches horrified, the powerless, tired, grey-haired Sophia transforms into her own version of the Hyde persona, the red-headed Ms Utterson.


Jeffrey Tayor of Stagescreen Productions had the idea of a modern version of "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" in the mid-1990s. He attempted to get it produced in the United States, but all three attempts fell through. He returned to England and joined with Hartswood Films when Elaine Cameron was looking for ideas for a supernatural thriller. Cameron approached Steven Moffat for a script. A six-part series was commissioned by the BBC's Jane Tranter and John Yorke in November 2005.
BBC America gave co-production funding in March 2006. The producers regularly met with Moffat for brainstorming sessions. The producers invited Moffat to "write anything", with the intention of cutting the material back later. However, they were reluctant to cut material once they saw it on the page. The first episode starts with Jackman already knowing about his alter ego. Because the plot of "Jekyll" begins after the story has developed for the characters, Nesbitt says that the show feels like it is a second series.

Moffat explicitly describes the series as a sequel, rather than an adaptation. He said the Jekyll of the original story really existed, and Jackman is his "modern-day descendant dealing with the same problems". As "Jekyll and Hyde" is such a well-known phrase, Moffat labored over what to call the series, eventually deciding upon "Jekyll" because that word "carries the name Hyde". The final episode replaces the title "Jekyll" with "Hyde". Producer Elaine Cameron says the one word title gives the series a "very modern feel". Moffat initially named the character Jekyll rather than Jackman, but found it cumbersome to constantly explain that the book had not been written in this alternate universe. Instead he chose a version where the book exists, but changed the name to Jackman. Otherwise, Cameron felt, the character would appear stupid by not realising what was happening when turning into Hyde.

The scene between Tom and Katherine was expanded slightly in the sixth episode to keep their relationship active to facilitate a second series. However, no further episodes were commissioned. In an August 2007 interview, Moffat told Alan Sepinwall of "The Star-Ledger" that he had a sequel written for the miniseries "should the BBC be interested".

Following "Jekyll," Moffat became a co-writer on "Sherlock."

James Nesbitt and his agent attended a meeting with Jane Tranter in late 2005 regarding the 2006 series of "Murphy's Law". At the conclusion of the meeting, she offered him a script for "Jekyll", suggesting that he might like the role. Nesbitt took the script role as a way of putting a distance between his previous work. The casting of Nesbitt as Tom Jackman and Hyde was publicised on 12 December 2005, but filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006, increasing Nesbitt's anticipation to play the roles. Writer Steven Moffat said that the dual-role required a very skilled actor, and a well-known actor was necessary because it was such an expensive show to produce. The production team decided Nesbitt's two characters would be mainly differentiated over a change in performance rather than by extensive make-up because they wanted Hyde to be able to walk around in public without attracting attention.

Michelle Ryan was revealed to have been cast as Jekyll's assistant, Katherine Reimer, in August 2006. Ryan believed herself to be too young for the part, though that aspect had already been written into the character. To prepare, she consulted the Royal College of Psychiatry. Ryan dyed her hair red for the role to help differentiate her from Tom Jackman's wife. Denis Lawson was cast as Peter Syme. The actor consulted his post-graduate son for information on Syme's job.

Moffat initially doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for the role of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom "Coupling". Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned for the role of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.

Meera Syal was attracted to her role because Miranda was not a clichéd private detective and she thought the humour was "fresh". During the second filming block, Mark Gatiss briefly joined the cast, playing the small but important role of Robert Louis Stevenson in flashback scenes in episode five.

Other roles included Paterson Joseph as Benjamin Maddox, Linda Marlowe as Ms Utterson and Al Hunter Ashton as Christopher.

The series was filmed in two blocks of three episodes. The first three were directed by Douglas Mackinnon and the second three episodes by Matt Lipsey. It took an hour of make-up each day to turn Nesbitt into Hyde; a hairpiece lowered his hairline and prosthetics were added to his chin, nose and ear lobes. He also wore black contact lenses to make Hyde "soulless". The producers decided that Hyde's imminent arrival would be indicated by the flash of a black eye. The eye imagery evolved during filming, and did not appear in the script.

Filming began in September 2006 with the zoo sequence from the second episode. Benjamin's team have set Tom up to force out Hyde by placing his son, Eddie, in the lion's den. Writing the sequence at a late stage in the production, Moffat wanted to compare Hyde's natural instinct to kill to that of a lion. This was shot on location at Heythrop Zoo, a private zoo in Chipping Norton run by Jim Clubb, whose firm Amazing Animals specialises in training animals for cinema and television. The Norman Foster-designed building in Chertsey, Surrey, which then housed the European Headquarters of video game designer and publisher Electronic Arts, was used as The Klein & Utterson Institute. A large country estate near Henley-on-Thames and in Bognor Regis was used for some of the scenes. A disused Boys' school in Gloucestershire, and the Hammer House in Wardour Street, Soho were used in episode six. Filming concluded on 20 December 2006.

The production team had twelve days to shoot each episode. Director Douglas Mackinnon says this was the biggest challenge of the project. The required amount of material was shot for most of the episodes. However, an extra twenty minutes of material was filmed for episode six. Director Matt Lipsey recalls that the team struggled to cut the extra material whilst maintaining the integrity of the episode. Lipsey credits Moffat for not "being precious" over his material during the editing process. His willingness to cut superfluous material meant that he was taken seriously when he argued for something to be retained.

The music was composed by Debbie Wiseman.

"Jekyll" was shown on BBC One on Saturday nights at 9p.m. A two-week break occurred between showings of the third and fourth episodes because the Live Earth benefit concert was broadcast during its timeslot on 7 July.

Certain edits were made to the United Kingdom broadcasts in order to remove language unsuitable for Saturday night BBC One audiences. For example, a line spoken by Hyde in episode one was changed from "Who the fuck is Mr Hyde?" to "Who the hell is Mr Hyde?"

James Jackson of "The Times" rated the first episode four out of five stars, calling Nesbitt's performance as Hyde "as entertainingly [over the top] as a dozen "Doctor Who" villains, with a palpable sense of menace to boot". The conspiracy plot is praised as a storyline that separates this series from other adaptations. "The Daily Telegraph's" Stephen Pile criticised the script for "veering between Hammer horror and larky humour". James Walton called the first episode a combination of "a good yarn with several nicely thoughtful touches". David Cornelius of "DVDTalk" said "six episodes, 300 minutes, not a single one of them wasted. 'Jekyll' is this year's finest television event".
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, commenting on the series being part of their 2008 line-up, said "This classic horror tale has been given a modern make-over that will leave you on the edge of your seat and begging for more. James Nesbitt is outstanding as the new Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde". Nesbitt was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television for his roles. Paterson Joseph received a mention in the nominations for the 2008 Screen Nation awards.

The BBFC rated all episodes as a 15 certificate on 11 June 2007. "Jekyll: Season One" was released for region 2 on 30 July 2007 by Contender Home Entertainment. It includes uncut episodes, including restoration of some swearing cut from the BBC broadcasts. As DVD Verdict says about this uncut version, "the language is saucier, the violence a bit more bloody, and the sex more primal." The disc contains audio commentaries on two episodes: producer Elaine Cameron, writer Steven Moffat and first-block director Douglas Mackinnon comment on episode one, while executive producer Beryl Vertue, second-block director Matt Lipsey and actress Gina Bellman comment upon the sixth episode. The set also contains two documentaries: "Anatomy of a Scene" focuses upon the production of the zoo sequence in episode two, while "The Tale Retold" covers the evolution of the series. The first Region 1 release occurred in the United States on 18 September 2007, although the Region 1 Canadian release was delayed until 9 October, following the Canadian broadcast of the series on Showcase, which commenced at the end of August 2007.

Jevons paradox

In economics, Jevons paradox is a paradox about resource usage. It is also called Jevons effect, after William Stanley Jevons who first observed it in 1865. Jevons observed that the steam engine James Watt had developed was much more efficient that the earlier model of Thomas Newcomen. Despite this, the use of coal in England increased. The improvements James Watt had introduced made coal a cheap source of energy. As a consequence, Watt's steam engine was more popular, and its use was more widespread. So even though each steam engine used less coal, the demand for coal increased, as there were more steam engines.

Floating exchange rate

A floating exchange rate is when the exchange rate between two currencies can change freely. It is also known as flexible exchange rate, or fluctuating exchange rate. Supply and demand will influence the exchange rate. Today, floating exchange rates between currencies are common. Usually, the market will regulate the exchange rate. In most cases, the central banks of the affected countries will not intervene. They might do something, if the exchange rate rises above a certain threshold, or it falls below a minimal value. 

The opposite is a fixed exchange rate, or pegged exchange rate.

Fixed exchange rate system

In a fixed exchange rate, a state authority defines an exchange rate of its own currency, against another currency, a basket of currencies, or some good, such as gold. The central bank of the country will then guarantee this exchange rate; it will buy or sell its currency at this rate.

London's Burning (TV series)

London's Burning is a British television drama programme. It was produced by London Weekend Television for the ITV network. It is about the lives of members of the London Fire Brigade at the fictional Blackwall fire station. It began with a TV movie pilot, shown on 7 December 1986. There were 14 series. They ran from 20 February 1988 to 25 August 2002.

Jack Rosenthal's original two-hour TV movie was shown on ITV on 7 December 1986.

It was directed by Les Blair. The Broadwater Farm riot inspired the screenplay.

The TV show was a weekly episodic drama that began on 20 February 1988. Paul Knight was the show's producer. Writers included Anita Bronson, David Humphries, Simon Sharkey, and Tony Hoare (writer). Directors included Gerry Poulson, Gerry Mill, John Reardon, Keith Washington and Alan Wareing. Emergencies, called 'shouts', would not only be fires, but included a range of incidents from cats up trees to major road accidents. Each episode ran for 50 minutes (one hour with advertisement breaks). The first series had five episodes. The second and third series each had eight episodes. Episodes were mostly filmed at Dockhead fire station in Bermondsey in London. Real firefighters working shifts were extras on the programme. A studio near the station was used for crowded mess scenes. They also used the fire station's actual mess, bay and watchroom throughout the series.

A Christmas special was transmitted between series 1 and 2 on 25 December 1988, on ITV. The special followed Blue Watch on duty on Christmas Day.

On 8 September 1991, a special 30-minute behind-the-scenes documentary started the fourth series. This documentary was also released onto VHS video, by Clear Vision Video. It was then added as a DVD extra, on the Series 4 DVD release by Network DVD.

In 1991, LWT commissioned 10 episodes for Series 4. It became the most popular series of the drama. Paul Knight had appointed Brian Clark as the Fire Brigade Advisor. The writers, directors, and Clark decided on a climax to the fourth series. The mental state of one of the main characters deteriorates after being buried alive under a collapsed wall. This is during a spectacular 20-pump warehouse fire. Series 4's climax won the programme a record rating of 18.86 million viewers.

Each series now included a major disaster or "shout". In Series 5, a spinning wheel ride at a fairground is jammed by a youth, played by Liam McGuire, armed with a pole. The ride collapses, and there is a huge fire with people trapped in the crushed metal. The series attracted 17 million viewers.

In the early 1990s, the ratings averaged 17–18 million viewers. In 1995 (Series 8), ratings fell to 16 million viewers.

Paul Knight decided it was time for a tragic exit for one of the main characters. The man who was to be killed was Sub Officer John Hallam. Hallam was killed off in 1996 (Series 9) during a huge warehouse fire. He and his colleague, Leading Firefighter Geoff Pearce, were attempting to rescue four teenage girls. They were on an unstable gantry above a blaze in the basement. Hallam held the gantry steady for Pearce as he walked across with one of the girls. As Hallam attempted to cross, the gantry cracked and Hallam fell to his death. The writers developed a storyline about Pearce feeling an overwhelming sense of guilt after the accident, which would lead to him considering a transfer.

Series 9 attracted 16.8 million viewers.

Series 10 was the last series produced by Paul Knight. It had 18 episodes. It focused on the crew's domestic lives rather than firefighting work. Budget cuts led to scenes being done with computer-generated imagery. Notable 'shouts' included ones at a paint factory and another at a bus depot.

The new producer was David Shanks. Series 11, 12 and 13 saw the return to firefighting scenes as the primary focus. Series 14 was almost completely based on soap opera-style story lines, with the number of fire 'shouts' severely reduced. Viewing figures slumped as the series was critically panned. In 2002 "London's Burning" was cut from the schedule; the final episode was broadcast on 25 August 2002 in a two-hour slot.

In 2000 a 90-minute behind-the-scenes special was released on VHS video.

The "London's Burning" theme used in Series 1–10 was composed by Simon Brint, Rowland Rivron, and Roddy Matthews. Series 11–13 used a theme composed by Warren Bennett. The series 14 theme was composed by Stuart Hancock and Toby Jarvis and produced at London-based music production house Mcasso Music. Hancock also composed the original incidental music score to all episodes of series 14.

Series 1–10 lacked a title sequence. The episodes opened with the text "London's Burning". It was in Futura bold condensed typeface and was superimposed in white over the opening scene of the episode. Series 11–13 used a montage of action shots superimposed over a fiery background as the text "London's Burning" superimposed in gold and black slowly grew in size over the course of the sequence. It quickly zoomed to fill the screen on the final musical flourish. Series 14 used a shorter montage of action and character shots before the text "london's burning" in orange and white appeared and moved closer together over a shot of fire engines emerging from the station.







The first few series used Dockhead Fire Station at 8 Wolseley Street, London SE1, as the exterior for Blackwall. The Jacob Street studio is opposite. It had a full scale reproduction of the mess, built by Colin Monk. The actual station mess was also used in the series, as were many other parts of the station and its actual firefighters. Dockhead is still an operational fire station but the original station building was demolished and replaced in 2015.

The Swan and Sugar Loaf pub, which featured as the firefighters' local pub, has since been converted to flats. The location is about 800 metres from Tower Bridge.

The Restaurant opened by Mike 'Bayleaf' Wilson in series 9 was filmed on location at The Chequers Inn, Deal, Kent.

Later series used the exterior of Leyton Fire Station and the Oliver Twist pub opposite.

All series of London's Burning were released between 2005 and 2011.

As of 6 January 2019, Drama is re-showing "London's Burning" at one episode per weekday (2.20–3.20 pm Monday to Friday).

Mary looks very graceful, which was a traditional Renaissance fashion. The French version was the first time that a Renaissance artist did not paint the Virgin Mary with a halo.

Many symbols and emblems in churches and buildings in Lierna lead explorers to discover the important role of the Knights Templar in the region.They also found that Leonardo's painting may have served as a mysterious map to a secret passage in an area of ​​the Grigna mountain range known as Alpe di Campione.

Juan Perón became Argentina's minister of labour after participating in the 1943 military coup and was elected president of Argentina in 1946. He introduced social programs that benefited the working class, supported labor unions, and called for additional involvement of the state in the economy. In addition he helped industrialists. Perón was very popular and gained even more admiration through his wife, Eva, who championed for the rights of migrant workers and was loved by the people. Due to rising inflation and other economic problems, the military overthrew Perón in 1955. The Peronist party was banned and it wasn't until 1973 that open elections were held again. In the 1973 election, Perón was again elected president. He died the next year and his widow, Isabel, took his place as president. Perón's death had led to disunity and the military overthrew Isabel in 1976.

Peronist Carlos Menem was president from 1989 to1999. His policies were very different from previous Peronists, he focused on privatization, free-market policies, and international relations. Peronist Néstor Kirchner was president from 2003 to 2007, and his wife Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was president from 2007 to 2015. According to the Economist, the Kirchners returned to "economic nationalism and near-autarky". The ideology of the Kirchners is known as Kirchnerism.

This was part of a contract which employers and employees signed when employees were hired. In the United States, yellow-dog contracts or yellow-dog clauses were often used by employers to stop the creation of unions. It let employers take legal action against union organizers. In 1932, yellow-dog contracts were made illegal in the United States under the Norris-LaGuardia Act.

Scratching

Scratching, sometimes referred to as scrubbing, is a DJ and turntablist technique of moving a vinyl record back and forth on a turntable to produce percussive or rhythmic sounds. A crossfader on a DJ mixer may be used to fade between two records simultaneously.

While scratching is most associated with hip hop music, where it emerged in the mid-1970s, from the 1990s it has been used in some styles of rap rock, rap metal and nu metal. In hip hop culture, scratching is one of the measures of a DJ's skills. DJs compete in scratching competitions at the DMC World DJ Championship and IDA (International DJ Association, formerly known as ITF (International Turntablist Federation). At scratching competitions, DJs can use only scratch-oriented gear (turntables, DJ mixer, digital vinyl systems or vinyl records only). In recorded hip hop songs, scratched "hooks" often use portions of other songs.

While scratching is becoming more and more popular in pop music, particularly with the crossover success of pop-hip hop tracks in the 2010s, sophisticated scratching and other expert turntablism techniques are still predominantly an underground style developed by the DJ subculture. The Invisibl Skratch Piklz from San Francisco focuses on scratching. In 1994, the group was formed by DJs Q-Bert, Disk & Shortkut and later Mix Master Mike. In July 2000, San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts held Skratchcon2000, the first DJ Skratch forum that provided “the education and development of skratch music literacy”. In 2001, Thud Rumble became an independent company that works with DJ artists to produce and distribute scratch records.

In 2004, "Scratch Magazine", one of the first publications about hip hop DJs and record producers, released its debut issue, following in the footsteps of the lesser-known "Tablist" magazine. Pedestrian is a UK arts organisation that runs Urban Music Mentors workshops led by DJs. At these workshops, DJs teach youth how to create beats, use turntables to create mixes, act as an MC at events, and perform club sets.

Scratching has been incorporated into a number of other musical genres, including pop, rock, jazz, some subgenres of heavy metal (notably nu metal) and some contemporary and avant-garde classical music performances. For recording use, samplers are often used instead of physically scratching a vinyl record.

DJ Product©1969, formerly of the rap rock band Hed PE, recalled that the punk rock band the Vandals was the first rock band he remembered seeing use turntable scratching. Product©1969 also recalled the early rap metal band Proper Grounds, which was signed to Madonna's Maverick Records, as being another one of the first rock bands to utilize scratching in their music.

Guitarist Tom Morello, known for his work with Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, has performed guitar solos that imitate scratching by using the kill switch on his guitar. Perhaps the best-known example is "Bulls on Parade", in which he creates scratch-like rhythmic sounds by rubbing the strings over the pick-ups while using the pickup selector switch as a crossfader.

Since the 1990s, scratching has been used in a variety of popular music genres such as nu metal, exemplified by Linkin Park, Slipknot and Limp Bizkit. It has also been used by artists in pop music (e.g. Nelly Furtado) and alternative rock (e.g. Incubus). Scratching is also popular in various electronic music styles, such as hard-groove techno.

The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet

The Most Mysterious Song on the Internet is an ongoing internet search. It involves many internet users from around the world trying to find out the artist and the title of a new wave song that played on a German radio station in 1984. 

A Rolling Stone article in September 2019 says that a man named "Darius S." recorded the song from a radio program called "Musik für junge Leute" ("Music for Young People") he listened to on the German public radio station NDR, probably in 1984. Darius says he recorded the song on a tape labeled "cassette 4", along with songs from XTC and The Cure that were released in around 1984. Further evidence shows that the Technics tape deck that he used to record the song was also made in 1984.

In 2007, Darius' sister, posting under the fake name "Anton," posted the song on the internet to try to find out the artist and the title of the song. The woman, who identified herself as "Lydia H.", posted part of the song to a German fan website devoted to eighties synth-pop and to spiritofradio.ca, a Canadian website that helps to identify songs uploaded by fans.

The mystery of the unidentified song became very popular in 2019 when a Brazilian teenager named Gabriel da Silva Vieira started to look for evidence of its origin. He uploaded a clip of the song to YouTube, and to several Reddit groups.

On July 9, 2019, YouTuber Justin Whang released an episode of his video series "Tales from the Internet". The episode talks about the progress of the search up to then. When the video was released, more internet users tried to help to identify the song. 

After the video came out, some progress was made. The whole song was found and posted by a Reddit user in July 2019. Furthermore, people who might have known the song were contacted. This includes people such as Paul Baskerville, who was the DJ of the show from which the song was likely recorded. He has said he does not remember the song. The Discord community of the search has also found other undocumented and/or obscure media of various genres.

Ritual purification

Ritual purification is the ritual prescribed by a religion by which a person is considered to be free of "uncleanliness". Many religions require that those worshipping should be in this state. Ritual purity is a state of ritual cleanliness. Ritual purification may also apply to objects and places. Ritual uncleanliness is not identical with ordinary physical impurity, such as dirt stains; nevertheless, body fluids are generally considered ritually unclean.

Most of these rituals existed long before the germ theory of disease, and figure prominently from the earliest known religious systems of the Ancient Near East. Some writers connect the rituals to taboos.

Some have seen benefits of these practices for health and preventing infections especially in areas where humans come in close contact with each other. While these practices came before the idea of the germ theory was public in areas that use daily cleaning, the destruction of infectious agents seems to be dramatic. Others have described a 'dimension of purity' that is universal in religions that seeks to move us away from disgust, (at one extreme) and to uplift us towards purity and divinity (at the other extreme). Away from uncleanliness to purity, and away from deviant to moral behavior, (within one's cultural context).


Monolatry

Monolatry ( ["monos"] = single, and ["latreia"] = worship) is belief that many gods exist, but that only one of them is worshipped. The term "monolatry" was perhaps first used by Julius Wellhausen.

Jiří Kylián

Jiří Kylián (born 21 March 1947) is a Czech former dancer and contemporary dance choreographer.

Jiří Kylián was born in 1947 in Prague – Czechoslovakia, as one of two sons to his father Václav who was a banker and to his mother Markéta, who was as a young teenager a dancer-child protégée.

During the years 1962-1967 Kylián studied at the Prague Conservatory. One teacher of the Conservatory, who left a deep mark on Kylián´s professional development, was Zora Šemberová, known for her world´s first interpretation of Juliet (1938) in Prokofiev’s famous ballet.
In 1967 Kylián had received a scholarship to study at the "Royal Ballet School" in London,

He met John Cranko, choreographer, there, who offered him a contract, to become a member of his acclaimed "Stuttgart Ballett". Before taking up his contract, Kylián shortly returned to Prague, but on August 21st, 1968, the invasion of the communist "Warsaw-Pact " forces began. On the 28th of August, after taking part in many demonstrations against the occupation, Kylián left for Germany.

In Stuttgart Cranko asked Kylián to create choreographies for the company. His first work was "Kommen und Gehen", created with Marcia Haydée and Richard Cragun. In the early 70’s Cranko invited Glen Tetley to become resident choreographer in Stuttgart. Tetley´s work made a great impression on Kylián, namely Tetley’s understanding of movement, and its relation to space, was a revelation for Kylián.

In early seventies, Kylián was invited to create his first choreography for the Netherlands Dance Theatre ("Viewers-1973"). Having created two more works for NDT ("Stoolgame" 1974 and "La Cathédrale Engloutie" 1975) the offer to become artistic director of NDT together with Hans Knill, was extented to him.

The creation of "Sinfonietta", to music of Kylian´s co-patriot Leoš Janáček for the "Charleston Festival" in the USA in 1978 led to international recognition of the company. Subsequently many important international tours of NDT have taken place incl. Metropolitan Opera House in New York, the Paris Opera etc.

During Kyliáns engagement in NDT (1975-2009), he has created more than 75 choreographies for the company. Further pieces he made for other worldwide companies, such as the Stuttgart Ballet, the Opéra de Paris, the Munich Bayerisches Staatsballett, and the Tokyo Ballet.

Realizing the importance of education of young dancers, Jiří Kylián and Carel Birnie, the managing director of NDT, have decided in 1978 to create a new company - NDT II, in which young people would get the opportunity to develop their skills and talents. After many years of directorship, Kylián saw the departure of many fine and interesting performers. It was in 1991 that he decided to create a small group for dancers, who find themselves in the precarious age between "forty and death". The world premiere of this “Senior Company” was created by choreographers: Hans van Manen, Mats Ek, William Forsythe and Jiří Kylián. The original dancers were: Sabine Kupferberg, Alida Chase, Gérard Lemaitre and Niklas Ek. The importance of this new development in dance was instantly recognized by the public as well as by the media.

The British version comes with two discs: one with the "Thomson Electronic Directory" for April 1992 on it, and one with the "Pocket Interpreter 5-language conversation book for travelers" on it. A DD-10EX was in an exhibition called "The Book and Beyond: Electronic Publishing and the Art of the Book", which was held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, from April 1995 to October 1995. The exhibition also included a CD-ROM for the Data Discman, which is called "The Library of the Future", and came out in 1993.

The DD-1EX and DD-10EX were both in a flip or clamshell design, while the flat, rectangular design of the DD-8 was closer to later e-book readers, such as the Amazon Kindle.

Le Courrier

Le Courrier is a French-language daily newspaper, which originated in Geneva. It was first issued as a Sunday newspaper, on January 5, 1868. Most people in Geneva are Protestant. Le Courrier was issues by a small number of Catholics. It has always had a strong focus on Catholic values. In 1892, it became a daily newspaper. In 1907, Geneva had a separation of Church and state; at that time, the number of printed copied dropped markedly.

Until 1923, the newspaper was Christian and stood for conservative values. In that year Christan Levraz changed the focus to focus more on social values - The newspaper was left-wing, from then on. The Catholic Church was not too happy with the left-wing orientation of the newspaper. In 1996, the Church stopped supporting Le Courrier, because it saw the journal's attitude as too close to the Biblical teachings (that is: too evangelical). Today, the newspaper collaborates with La Liberté, another Catholic newspaper from Fribourg. In the year 2019, 7.000-8.000 copies were printed each day.

U.S. Route 101

U.S. Route 101, or U.S. Highway 101, (US 101) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway that goes along the West Coast of the United States. It goes through the states of California, Oregon, and Washington. It goes alongside, and often joins onto, California State Route 1 when going through California. Unlike most other 3 digit routes in the system which are treated as spurs of their two digit parent routes, US 101 is treated as a two digit Route with a first digit of "10". The reason for this was that if the west coast highway was numbered US 91, there would be no room to establish US 93, US 95, US 97, and US 99, all of which must be west of US 91. So, they decided to call the west coast highway US 101 instead. The '10' could have been underlined so that people think that this route is a two digit route rather than a spur route of US 1, the US Highway on the east coast.

The route starts in Los Angeles at the junction of the Interstate 5, Interstate 10, and California State Route 60. It goes west past the north side of Downtown Los Angeles towards the coast. It meets the coast near Oxnard and goes north along the coast from here. The main cities it passes through in California is Santa Maria, San Jose, San Francisco, Santa Rosa, and Eureka, California. In San Francisco, the route goes over the Golden Gate Bridge. The main cities the route passes in Oregon is North Bend, Florence, Newport, and Astoria. These cities are small, as no large cities are on Oregon's coast. It runs near to the Interstate 5, which goes through larger cities like Salem and Portland. In Washington, the main cities it passes through is Aberdeen, Forks and Port Angeles. It ends at the Interstate 5 in Olympia. The route is about in total.

The route used to be the main highway along the West Coast, but now most people use the Interstate 5 to go along the coast. The US 101 used to go south to San Diego, but the part of the US 101 between here and Los Angeles was totally replaced by the I-5 in the 1960s. When it first opened, the US 101 used small roads that had already been built. In 1933, a new highway with bridges and ramps was built so it was faster for people to use.

The second most common Yupik language in Siberia is Naukan Yupik, with about 70 speakers.

There are two dialects: Chaplino Yupik is mainly spoken on the Chukchi Peninsula, Siberia, and St. Lawrence Island Yupik. The differences between the two dialects are small.
