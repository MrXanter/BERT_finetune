Discovery doctrine

The discovery doctrine or doctrine of discovery is a legal term. It means that if a country was not under the control of a king who was from Europe and Christian, then any European Christian country could take control of the land. The discovery doctrine ignores any claim to the land that the native people living there might make.

Many European kings used the discovery doctrine to justify colonization. They said that they wanted to bring civilization and Christianity to new places. Back then, it was thought that European culture was the best culture and Christianity was the best religion.

The courts of the United States have used the discovery doctrine to say that Native Americans were not allowed to own land. The reasoning behind this thinking is that they were just occupants of the land and did not really own it before Europeans came. Therefore, the land was not theirs but belongs to European governments or their successors (in this case, the United States and Americans would be the land owner since the country was formed after independence from Great Britain).

Many people now think that the discovery doctrine is not fair and racist. They think indigenous peoples should have the right to own land because the land is part of who they are as a people group and owning land allows them to have more legal benefits.

Some churches that have supported the discovery doctrine in the past now repudiate it. That means that they do not believe anymore and that they are sorry for all the hurt it has caused. Many of the churches that repudiated the discovery doctrine are Protestant churches in North America, specifically the United States. 

The Catholic Church has not made a statement against the discovery doctrine. Many of the rulers who used the doctrine discovery were Catholics.

The Catholic Church officially repudiated the Doctrine of Discovery in March of 2023.

Lamborghini Espada

The Lamborghini Espada is a station wagon made by Lamborghini. It was made from 1968 to 1978. There were three generations of the Espada. These generations were known as Series I, Series II, and Series III.

The Lamborghini Espada was designed by Marcello Gandini in 1967.

The Espada is a four-seater grand-touring car. It was initially sold at the same time as the Islero and the mid-engine Miura. The Espada and the Islero both replaced the 400 GT.

Three different series of the Espada were made. These were the S1 (1968–1970), the S2 (1970–1972) and the S3 (1972–1978). Each series was an update from the last, with changes such as more horsepower and a redesigned interior. Overall, 1,217 Espadas were made.

The Espada was launched at the 1968 Geneva Motor Show, alongside the Islero. The Espada was equipped with a Lamborghini V12 engine, which was based off the one used in the 400 GT 2+2. The engine was rated at in the series I cars. 186 Series I Espadas were made before January 1970.

At the 1970 Brussels Motor Show, Lamborghini revealed the Series II version of the Espada. The power output of the Espada increased to due to a higher 10.7:1 compression ratio. The brakes were changed to vented Girling discs instead of solid discs. CV joints were now used on the rear half-shafts. Lamborghini made 575 of the Series II Espadas, which was the most of any series of Espada.

The Series III Espada was launched in 1972. It was fitted with wider Pirelli Cinturato 215/70WR15 CN12 tyres. The front grille now had a square instead of hexagonal mesh. A sunroof was also made an option for the Series III.

The engine was carried over from the Series II Espada. Power steering by ZF and air conditioning were now standard. In 1974, a Chrysler Torqueflite 3 speed automatic transmission became available as an option.

From 1975, large impact bumpers had to be installed to meet United States safety requirements. Other changes had to be made for the car to meet US laws. Some people consider these later US-spec cars to be a separate fourth series of the Espada.

The Espada used an updated version of the 400 GT’s 4.0 liter V12 engine. The engine produced horsepower in the Series I Espada, and in the Series II and III Espadas. The engine was paired to a five-speed manual transmission, with a three-speed Chrysler-built automatic transmission as an option for the Series III Espada.


Chattering rock frog

The chattering rock frog ("Litoria staccato") is a small frog from Australia. It lives in Western Australia.

This frog can grow to 3.5 cm long from nose to rear end. This frog can be dark red, light brown or gray in colour. It has some stripes on its head and body and some webbing on its feet.

They lay eggs in the rocky streams and other rocky bodies of water. The eggs sink to the bottom. The tadpoles swim to the top and stay near the surface. They take two months to become frogs.

Serial comma

The serial comma or Oxford comma is a comma used directly after the second-to-last item in a list of three or more items. For example, a list of three people may be shown as "Alice, Bob, and Charlie" (with the comma) or "Alice, Bob and Charlie" (without the comma).

Some style guides prefer using the comma, while others advise against it. It may sometimes be useful to add the comma to avoid confusion. For example, a sentence such as "Please bring Marcus, a musician and a skater to the dinner event today" may confuse anyone reading that sentence. Without the Oxford comma, they might think that Marcus is a musician and a skater, so they would need to bring Marcus instead of three people to that dinner event today.

When following a style guide that opposes the comma, one can rearrange the terms to avoid confusion. For example, saying "a musician, a skater and Marcus" does not change the intended meaning, but it avoids the confusion.

Burmese alphabet

The Burmese alphabet is an alphabet that is used to write some languages, including the Burmese language. It is also used to write down the religious languages of Sanskrit and Pali. It is very different from the ABCs. It is known for having a lot of round letters that look like circles.

Some people in Burma use the Burmese alphabet to write their own languages, but add extra letters to represent the sounds unique to their own languages.

Burmese is written from left to right.

Monks would write on palm leaves. They had to make the letters round because straight lines would split the leaf and ruin it. Eventually, these round letters became the Burmese alphabet as we know it today.

The Burmese alphabet has 33 basic consonants. Extra marks are added to indicate vowels and tones.

There are 33 consonants in the Burmese alphabet. When they are alone, they have an "ah" sound, although people use the "uh" sound when another syllable follows it.

The Burmese alphabet is not organized the same way as the ABCs. Instead, consonants are organized by the parts of the mouth they are made in. For example, the first row of consonants are all sounds that are made when the tongue is against the back of the mouth.

Some letters are written different in different cases to avoid confusion with other letters. For example, ဝ + ာ is written as ဝါ (wah) to avoid confusion with တ (t).

There are letters that are used in words from Pali. They are: ဃ (gh), ဈ (jh), ဋ (ṭ), ဌ (ṭh), ဍ (ḍ), ဎ (ḍh), ဏ (ṇ), ဓ (dh), and ဠ (ḷ).

Two letters, ၐ ("ś") and ၑ ("ṣ"), are only used in words that are from Sanskrit. They are pronounced the same as သ.

To make more consonants, special marks are written around or below consonants. These marks are: ျ, ြ, ွ, and ှ. They change the consonant sound. For example, ရ makes a y sound (like you) but ရ + ှ makes ရှ which makes a sh sound (like shoe). There are rules about which consonants can be changed this way.

Every letter has a "ah" sound when it's alone. For example, က is pronounced as "kah." When a lone letter is followed by another syllable, it is pronounced with a "uh" sound.

Special marks are written around the letters to show other vowels.

Burmese is a tonal language. That means that the meaning of a word can change by how fast or slow someone let air out of their throats. In written Burmese, tones are indicated by special marks.

These marks are း (high tone) and ့ (creaky tone, but can only be used when an ending consonants is written down too).

Burmese words cannot end in a consonant sound. For example, "cat" would not be a word in Burmese because it has a "t" sound at the end. However, words are written with consonants to indicate special vowel sounds that are allowed at the end of Burmese words. These consonants have a special mark on them (်) called asat. When these consonants are combined with the vowels that are already written, they are called syllable rhymes.

Some of these special consonants indicate that the word needs to end with a puff of air, like in "uh-oh" between the uh and the oh. They are: က်, စ်, တ်, ပ်.

Other special sounds indicate that the vowels is nasal. Nasal vowels are not found in English, but are found in other languages like French and Portuguese. They are: င်, ည် ဉ်, န်, မ်.

In Burmese writing, consonants can be written on top of each other. There are very specific rules on which consonants can be stacked on top of which.

Kongonaphon

Kongonaphon is an early member of the dinosaur–pterosaur clade Ornithodira. It is a small reptile-type fossil found in the 
Middle to Late Triassic of Madagascar. It was probably an insectivore, based on the shape and texture of its teeth.

"Kongonaphon" is notable for its tiny size, even compared to other small early avemetatarsalia. The femur was only about 4 cm (1.6 inches) long, and the total height of the animal was about 10 cm (3.9 inches). 

It has long been thought that early members of the group were small. If they were as small as this, then a miniaturization event occurred near the base of the avian stem lineage. Also the small size explains the origin of body covering ("integument", hair on the body of dinosaurs and feathers on birds). Tiny creatures are most vulnerable to changes in external temperature.

Knuckle-walk

Knuckle-walking is a way some land animals move. Knuckle-walking animals curl fingers or front toes like a fist and touch the ground using the bony part of the front foot, the knuckle. Gorillas, chimpanzees, anteaters and platypuses knuckle-walk. In general, animals knuckle walk if their hands or front paws have special shapes for doing something very different from walking. Apes use their hands to hold food and use tools, so they have fingers. They curl up their fingers when they knuckle-walk. Anteaters use their front paws to dig for ants, so they curl up their digging claws when they knuckle-walk. Platypuses use their front paws to swim, so they curl up their webbed toes when they knuckle-walk.

Large anteaters that walk on the ground, for example the giant anteater, knuckle-walk. Smaller anteaters that live in trees do not. Platypuses walk on their knuckles so that the webbing on their front feet will not get in the way.

Gorillas from the genus "Gorilla" and chimpanzees from the genus "Pan" both walk on their knuckles but not in the same way. Chimpanzees spend more time in trees than gorillas do, so they turn their wrists in many different ways. Gorillas usually keep their wrists straight when they knuckle-walk. Gorillas and chimpanzees knuckle-walk when they move on the ground because their bodies are adapted to move around in trees: their arms are longer than their legs, and their middles are cone-shaped. The bones in their arms are good for knuckle-walking: the radius can lock into one of the bones in the wrist so the two bones together can hold the animal's weight. Human arm and wrist bones do not do this.

Some fictional cavemen knuckle-walk or drag the knuckles of their long arms on the ground, but scientists do not agree on whether human beings evolved from ancestors who really knuckle-walked on the ground the way gorillas do. One team of scientists said humans evolved from a tree-living ancestor, like chimpanzees did, because of the way our wrist bones are. Another team of scientists wrote that "Australopithecus anamensis" and "Australopithecus afarensis", extinct relatives of humans, probably knuckle-walked.

Saluga and Ghazal protected area

Saluga and Ghazal protected area is one of the nature reserves in southern Egypt and is considered the smallest, as its area does not exceed half a kilometer in the form of islands groups in the Nile River. 

The reserve is located in Aswan Governorate, specifically at the first waterfall, about 3 km north of Aswan Reservoir. In south of it, there is the island of Suhail, and to the north there are the islands of Esposarte, Amun and the Botanical Garden (El Nabatat Island).

The name is taken from the two most important islands in the reserve. Saluja Island, which means (waterfall) in Nubian language, while the name Ghazal Island seems to refer to one of the ancient plants that were growing on these islands.

The region declared a nature reserve by decision of the Prime Minister of Egypt in 1986. With the aim of preserving the biological diversity of endangered animals, plants and mammals.

The reserve contains a variety of living creatures from the animal and plant kingdoms despite the small size of the reserve and its presence in the middle of the Nile. Among the most famous animals in the reserve are camels, goats, wild donkeys, hyenas, and the red fox (the Egyptian fox) which, although it does not live mainly in the islands of the reserve but lives in the West Bank of the Nile and crosses the river by swimming to build a hole on the islands of the reserve. Sixty species of resident and migratory birds live in the reserve as well, some of which are threatened with extinction. The most famous of these rare birds is the black ibis, which became the symbol of the reserve. The plant life in the reserve is more varied and clear, as there are more than 90 different types of plants. The reserve is characterized by stunning landscapes that combine the often quiet vegetation with the water surface of the Nile, which made it an important tourist attraction.

Joseph James DeAngelo

He was responsible for at least three crime sprees throughout California. 

DeAngelo killed many people in southern California, where he was known as the Night Stalker and later the Original Night Stalker (because serial killer Richard Ramirez had also been called the "Night Stalker"). He is believed to have threatened both victims and police.

During the decades-long investigation, several suspects were cleared through DNA evidence, alibi, or other investigative methods. 

In 2001, after DNA testing indicated that the East Area Rapist and the Original Night Stalker were the same person, the name EARONS started to be used. He was nicknamed Golden State Killer in early 2013 to raise awareness that he was not caught. 

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and local law-enforcement agencies held a news conference on June 15, 2016, to announce a renewed nationwide effort. On April 24, 2018, authorities charged 72-year-old DeAngelo with eight counts of first-degree murder, based upon DNA evidence; investigators had identified members of DeAngelo's family through forensic genetic genealogy. 

DeAngelo cannot be charged with 1970s rapes, but he was charged in August 2018 with 13 related kidnapping and kidnapping attempts. On June 29, 2020, DeAngelo pled guilty to multiple counts of murder and kidnapping. 

As part of the plea bargain, DeAngelo was also required to admit to many crimes he had not been formally charged with, including rapes.

Rest in power

Rest in power is a saying that is used to replace "rest in peace," which is said after someone dies. The phrase "rest in power" is used for people who have dedicated their lives to activism or those who have died due to oppression, such as racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. Using the term "rest in power" instead of "rest in peace" sends a message that the dead person cannot rest in peace until change occurs. "Rest in power" also means that the dead person is making changes in society despite being dead.

The phrase "rest in power" is used in progressive groups.

"Rest in power" is a newer phrase. An early example of the phrase was published in an LA Weekly article about Latino gangs in East L.A. in 1989. 

Another use appeared in 2000 in honor of a graffiti artist in Oakland, California who was shot and killed.

By the mid-2000s, the phrase began to appear in print, again linked to young people's premature, violent deaths. In March 2003, under the headline "Rest In Power, Rachel Corrie", "In These Times" eulogised the death of activist Rachel Corrie at the hands of the Israeli military in Gaza. In a 2005 opinion piece in the "San Francisco Chronicle", Meredith Maran reflected on 19-year-old Meleia Willis-Starbuck, a Dartmouth College scholarship student who was home in Berkeley for the summer when she was shot and killed by an unknown assailant outside her apartment. Writing of the makeshift public altar set up to mourn Willis-Starbuck, Maran wrote, "I've never seen 'Rest in Power' written as a substitute for 'Rest in Peace.'"

A September 29, 2005 article in the "Ottawa Citizen", a Canadian newspaper, described a public graffiti memorial for teenage Ottawa murder victim Jennifer Teague that portrayed "a smiling Ms. Teague beneath the words, 'Rest in power'" and framed by "two black angels."

People who are part of Black Lives Matter use "Rest in power" to remember all Black people who died because of racism. Even though the phrase wasn't used yet during the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 60s, people still say "rest in power" when talking about people who died because of racism back then or were involved in the movement. For example, Emmett Till died in 1955, but people still say "rest in power" when they're talking about him.

When Trayvon Martin died, his parents used the phrase to honor him. They wrote a book called "Rest in Power" about his life.

An American trans girl named Leelah Alcorn committed suicide in 2014, citing her inability to continue living with her parents' transphobia. After her death, her parents continued to refuse to recognize or respect her identity, and instead chose to use her deadname instead of her preferred name. People in queer online communities used "rest in power" to honor Leelah and her struggle for recognition and acceptance.

Deadnaming

Deadnaming is using a name (called a "deadname") that a transgender person used before transitioning without their permission. It is called that because the person who that name belongs to is considered "dead" and is now a brand-new person. 

Sometimes, people deadname another person by accident. They may know the other person before they transitioned. Other times, people deadname other people on purpose. Using a person's deadname is considered to be very disrespectful because it ignores a person's gender identity and is a type of transphobia if it happens on purpose. Some people think that deadnaming is a form of violence.

It is very hard for people to change their names on forms because there is a lot of paperwork involved. That means that they are more likely to experience deadnaming.

Hexokinase

A hexokinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates (adds phosphyryl groups) hexoses (six-carbon sugars). It takes in a substrate (usually glucose in most organisms) and adds a phosphate (usually from ATP) to form hexose phosphate as the product. When the substrate is glucose, the product is glucose-6-phosphate.

Suicide of Leelah Alcorn

Leelah Alcorn was a transgender American girl. On December 28, 2014, she killed herself because her parents did not respect her gender identity. They made her learn lessons at home and forced her to go to conversion therapy in order to force her to accept her birth gender. After Alcorn died, many laws were made in order to stop discrimination against trans people.

Leelah Alcorn was born into a conservative Christian family. They lived in the U.S. state of Ohio.

In the United States, many conservative Christians do not like anything related to LGBT causes. They believe that boys will always be boys and girls will always be girls because they think that God made them that way. They also think that transgender people are "confused" and need to learn how to appreciate their birth gender. One way they do that is through conversion therapy. However, many studies have shown that this type of therapy does not work and hurts the people it is supposed to help.

Ever since she was 4, Alcorn felt like a "girl trapped in a boy's body." When she was 14, she identified as transgender. She told her mom that she was transgender. Her mom said that it was a "phase" and that she could never be a woman. This made her depressed, so her mom sent her to Christian therapists who also told her that she was a man and that she should "look to God for help." When Alcorn was still alive, conversion therapy was still legal in Ohio. Going to these therapists did not make her feel better.

When Alcorn was 16, she told other kids at school that she liked boys. Other kids at school accepted that she liked boys and were happy for her. However, her parents were not happy. They thought she was making the family name look bad. They made her go to an online school that taught Christian values. They did not allow her to use social media or a cell phone. Because of these rules, Alcorn felt very alone.

Before she died, Alcorn wrote a post on Tumblr. It said:

Alcorn asked for her belongings to be sold so that the money could go to support groups that work for trans rights. She signed the note as "(Leelah) Alcorn." "Josh" was the name her parents gave her at birth.

She also wrote another note and left it in her bedroom. It said, "I've had enough." Her parents threw it away after the police made a copy.

Alcorn walked onto a highway near her house and was hit by a truck.

The note got a lot of attention on Tumblr. However, her Tumblr blog disappeared after her parents asked Tumblr to delete it.

Alcorn's family had a private funeral. Her body was said to have been cremated.

In 2015, the Ohio State Patrol said that Alcorn's death was a suicide.

Many people were sad that Leelah Alcorn died and that she was treated badly by her parents. They thought that she was a victim of her parent's transphobia.

Alcorn's parents were sad that she died. However, they refused to recognize her as transgender. In a Facebook post, Alcorn's mother Carla called her by her deadname, A lot of people thought that was disrespectful because "Josh" was not the name Alcorn wanted to be called. Some people sent mean messages to her mom on Facebook. Others said that her parents should go to jail and lose custody of their other kids. Carla Alcorn deleted the post.

Carla Alcorn went onto CNN and said that "we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what. I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy." Some people said that their love was not "unconditional" because of their hostile reaction to Leelah when she told them she was trans.

Many people around the world talked about Alcorn's death. They made art and lit candles to honor her.

Many LGBT rights groups said that transgender suicide happened a lot because trans people are being treated badly, just like how Leelah was treated wrong. Besides the problem of suicide, trans people are often killed and treated wrong in other ways.

Some people tried to raise money to buy a gravestone with the name Leelah Alcorn on it to replace the gravestone with her birth name on it. However, this did not happen. Instead, a group bought a bench, tree, and plaque.

A petition was made to ban conversion therapy in the United States. President Barack Obama said that he supported laws banning conversion therapy. 

In December of 2015, Cincinnati banned conversion therapy. As of July 2020, five cities in Ohio have banned conversion therapy and two others had banned it on minors.

Eat the Rich

Eat the Rich is a phrase. Attributed to French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau The direct phrase in his original language is: ""Quand les pauvres n'auront plus rien à manger, ils mangeront les riches!"" (When the poor have nothing more to eat, they will eat the rich!).

This saying is used by people who are anti-capitalist to show their disapproval of Capitalism whos wealth is built on the exploitation of the people - literally to starvation. It is a warning to the rich who would build their wealth at the expense of everyone else, as the poor will unite in arms to take their heads ("eat" here not being used literally to mean cannibalism). Today it is a battlecry or slogan to rally the working class against those that would exploit them. This phrase was used more at the beginning of the 21st century because of increasing income inequality.

The phrase Eat the Rich is used in pop culture. It expresses rebellion against the wealthy and powerful.

Skin-walker

A skin-walker (Navajo: yee naaldlooshii) is a fictional shape shifting creature that usually takes the form of a wolf or coyote. It is said that in order to become one you must kill a close friend or a family member.

The concept of the skin-walker is unique to the Navajo people. In their language, the word "yee naaldlooshii" means, "with it [the animal skin], he goes on all fours."

A skin-walker may be a man or a woman. Skin-walkers are usually associated with trickster animals like the coyote or with animals that represent death and bad luck. They can turn into any animal they want by wearing its skin. Because of this, the Navajo will not wear the skin of a predator animal. Also, skin-walkers are really fast. People can be possessed by a skin-walker by looking them in the eye.

A skin-walker knows about the same rituals and spells like other Navajo medicine men. Unlike medicine men, they use their knowledge to do evil. A person becomes a skin-walker by killing someone in their family, which is a really evil thing to do according to the Navajo.

The Navajo agree that skin-walkers are hard to kill. According to them, the best way to kill a skin-walker is to get a shaman who knows about good magic to do certain spells and rituals that can return a skin-walker's evil back to them. Others think that skin-walkers can be killed by bullets dipped in white ash. However, these bullets won't work unless they hit the skin-walker in the head or neck.

The skin-walker represents everything evil in the Navajo culture. To them, there is nothing good about the skin-walker. People who are skin-walkers use black magic to kill others.

They really do not like talking about skin-walkers, especially to people who are not Navajo. Some even do not want to say the word and will take great pains to hide it, such as by typing sk*nw*lker. They believe that saying its name or mentioning it will make it appear.

The Navajo tell stories about the skin-walker in order to teach their children about right and wrong. They believe that children who learn how to do the right thing and lead moral lives are less likely to become evil, which is what the skin-walker is.

When non-Native people talk about the skin-walker, they usually use it in horror movies and stories. But when Native people tell horror stories, they use another scary character to replace the skin-walker.

Big Five

Big Five is the name colloquially given to the five largest banks that dominate the banking industry of Canada. All five banks are operationally based in Toronto. All five banks are classified as Schedule I banks that are domestic banks operating in Canada under government charter. The banks' shares are widely held, with any entity allowed to hold a maximum of twenty percent.

The Big Five are among the world's strongest banks, with Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal & Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce at 11th, 15th, 21st, 28th & 29th place, respectively.

In modern history, Royal Bank has always been the largest by a significant margin, although TD Bank has overtaken RBC in recent years. Up to the late 1990s, CIBC was the second largest, followed by Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, and TD Bank. During the late 1990s and beyond, this ranking changed due to several reorganizations. Royal Bank acquired Royal Trust in 1993, while Scotiabank purchased National Trust in 1997. As Scotiabank found no merger partners among the other banks in the big five group, it instead expanded its international operations and passed the Bank of Montreal in size. TD Bank merged with Canada Trust, which was for a long time the largest trust in Canada, thus vaulting TD into the number one spot. There has been no major changes to Bank of Montreal. CIBC's first unsuccessful foray into the US market led it to shed its assets there, dropping it to the number five spot.

Four Pillars

The four pillars policy is an Australian government policy to maintain the separation of the four largest banks in Australia by rejecting any merger or acquisition between the four major banks.

The policy, originally "six pillars" (it initially included AMP and National Mutual), was adopted in 1990 by then Labor Treasurer Paul Keating. It covered the big four banks (Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, NAB, ANZ) and two insurers (AMP and National Mutual). It was essentially designed to block the merger between ANZ and National Mutual at the time. Keating believed this arrangement would ensure a competitive banking market.

In 1997, leading business figure Stan Wallis (Businessweek bio) produced a report of his inquiry into Australia's financial system (the Final Report of the Financial System Inquiry, commonly referred to as "the Wallis report.") which recommended that the "Four Pillars" model be dismantled, to leave the banks subject to the same merger competition tests as other businesses. In response, then Coalition Treasurer Peter Costello's removed the pillar status of the two insurers (National Mutual had by that time already been acquired by France's AXA), but the ban on mergers of the remaining four banks was retained, with the rider that none of them were considered immune from foreign takeover. With the change of government, new Treasurer Wayne Swan has stated in 2008, that the Labor government has no plans to dismantle the four pillars policy.

The four pillars policy does not prevent the four major banks from acquiring smaller competitors. For example, in 2000, CBA acquired the Colonial group, which had emerged as a major bank–insurance combine in the 1990s, after the Colonial Mutual insurance group took over State Bank of NSW in 1994. The Commonwealth Bank also acquired the State Bank of Victoria in 1990 and BankWest in 2008. Westpac acquired the Challenge Bank in 1995, the Bank of Melbourne in 1997, and St.George Bank in 2008.

The policy has been criticised for being anti-competitive by ensuring that the four major banks are immune from takeover by the most likely suitors. At the same time, it is credited with insulating the banks from the global financial crisis of 2007–08. The major banks have criticised the policy on the basis that limiting the size of Australian banks makes them less internationally competitive.

According to the Soviet Major General Petro Grigorenko, Voroshilov himself alluded to the heritage of his birth-country, Ukraine, and to the previous family name of "Voroshilo".

He was married to Ekaterina Voroshilova (born Golda Gorbman). She came from a Jewish Ukrainian family from Mardarovka.

Jargon File

The Jargon File is a glossary and usage dictionary of slang used by computer programmers. The original Jargon File was a collection of terms from technical cultures such as the MIT AI Lab, the Stanford AI Lab (SAIL) and others of the old ARPANET AI/LISP/PDP-10 communities. It included Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Carnegie Mellon University, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. It was published in paperback form in 1983 as The Hacker's Dictionary (edited by Guy Steele), revised in 1991 as The New Hacker's Dictionary (ed. Eric S. Raymond; third edition published 1996).

The concept of the file began with the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) that came out of early PDP-1 and TX-0 hackers in the 1950s, where the term hacker emerged and the ethic, philosophies and some of the nomenclature emerged.

Crimean Tatar language

The Crimean Tatar language (which is often simply called Crimean) is spoken by Crimean Tatars who live mostly in the Crimean peninsula.

There are about 500,000 native speakers of Crimean. About half of them live on the Crimean peninsula, about 200,000 in Uzbekistan, about 30,000 in Russia, 2,500 in Romania and 600 in Bulgaria.

Nyctimystes

Nyctimystes is a genus of tree frogs in the family Pelodryadidae. Most of them are from Papua New Guinea but some live on the Moluccas islands. Some scientists think "Nyctimystes" should be considered part of "Litoria", another genus of frogs from New Guinea. Other scientists think that it is right to say "Nyctimystes" is its own genus.

All frogs in "Nyctimystes" have marks on their lower eyelids: lines, veins, or dots. Scientists think this helps the frog harder to see so it can hide from larger animals that want to eat it. Scientists tell "Nyctimystes" frogs apart from "Litoria" frogs because "Nyctimystes" frogs have vertical (up and down) pupils in their eyes and "Litoria" frogs have horizontal (side to side) pupils in their eyes.

These frogs live in tropical or subtropical rainforests on mountains. Their eggs are large and scientists have seen many of them laying eggs on underwater objects in fast-flowing creeks and streams, enough that they think all "Nyctimystes" frogs do this. The tadpoles have large sucker-mouths and streamlined bodies with large, muscular tails. All "Nyctimystes frogs" have webbed feet and large discs on their toes for climbing.

Scientists say most "Nyctimystes" frogs became separate species during the Miocene era, about 10 to 22 million years ago.

The name comes from the Greek "nycktos" for "night" and "myst" meaning "mist." Together they refer to "mysteries of the night."

Many of these frogs are few in number in the wild, and scientists do not know much about most of them. Scientists often write papers saying a frog species should be renamed and moved from "Nyctimystes" into "Litoria" or "Ranoidea", so the list below may change:

French-Azerbaijani University

The French-Azerbaijani University (, , UFAZ) was created in 2016 on the initiative of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and French President François Hollande as a joint project led by the University of Strasbourg and the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industry University (ASOIU).

The UFAZ campus is housed in a historical building at Nizami Street 183 in the city center of the Azerbaijani capital city Baku.

It has around 70 professors and other faculty members, and around 538 students.

Teaching at UFAZ is in the English language, and the academic curriculum followed is the one of the University of Strasbourg, and the University of Rennes 1 for oil and gas engineering bachelor program.

To harmonize the 3-year undergraduate course in France with the 4-year bachelor program in Azerbaijan, the first year at UFAZ is a foundation year. The teaching staff consists of both French and Azerbaijani professors. Upon graduation, UFAZ graduates receive Azerbaijani (ASOIU) and French (University of Strasbourg or University of Rennes 1) national diplomas.

At present, the UFAZ counts 4 specialties at the bachelor level: chemical engineering, geophysical engineering, computer science, and oil and gas engineering.

Most UFAZ students, more than 80%, are scholarship holders who receive free education based on Azerbaijani government's financial support.

UFAZ will open new master's programs for the 2020/2021 academic year in the following areas: chemical engineering / physical chemistry, geosciences and applied computer sciences (big data and artificial intelligence).



School discipline

When a student or group of students show behaviour that disrupts the current activity, or that goes against rules of the school, a teacher or the school can take action. This action is usually called school discipline. Discipline can guide the children's behaviour or set limits to help them learn to take better care of themselves, other people and the world around them.

Every school has a set of rules and if students break these rules they are subject to discipline. For example, these rules may say that pupils (students) need to wear a school uniform, and what the school uniform must look like. They usually also say that school starts at a given time, and that pupils must be present at the school, at that time. If pupils do not follow the rules, they will be punished. The term "discipline" is applied to the punishment that is the consequence of breaking the rules. The aim of discipline is to set limits restricting certain behaviors or attitudes that are seen as harmful or against the school policies, educational norms, school traditions, etc. In the early days of schools, it was common to punish people if they did not follow the rules set by the school. In more recent times, other approaches have also been tried, such as rewarding good behavior. 

It is important to create an environment, where it is safe and fun for children to learn. Many people confuse discipline with classroom management; discipline is one dimension of classroom management and classroom management is a general term. Discipline can also have a positive effect on both the individual as well as classroom environment. The right form of punishment can give the pupil a chance to reflect and learn about consequences. It can also give collective values, and encourage behavior that is acceptable for the classroom. Recognition of the diversity of values within communities can increase understanding and tolerance of different disciplinary techniques.

Coproal punishment was the most common means of maintaining discipline. When a child was at school, the teacher acted as a substitue parent. Many forms of punishment and rewards were open to the teacher. Hitting children with a cane or a stick was a common punishment if the child did something wrong. 

Corporal punishment in schools has now disappeared from most Western countries, including all European countries. In the United States, corporal punishment is not used in public schools in 34 states, banned in 31, permitted in 19, of which only 16 actually have school districts actively administering corporal punishment. Every U.S. state except New Jersey and Iowa permits corporal punishment in private schools. Many private schools have abandoned the practice, though, especially Catholic schools, nearly all of which now ban. Thirty-one U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia have banned it from public schools, most recently New Mexico in 2011. The other 19 states (mostly in the South) still allow corporal punishment in public schools. Of the 19 which permit the practice, three – Arizona, Colorado, and Wyoming have no public schools that actually use corporal punishment as of 2016. Paddling is still used to a significant (though declining) degree in some public schools in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Private schools in these and most other states may also use it, though many choose not to do so.

Official corporal punishment, often by caning, remains commonplace in schools in some Asian, African and Caribbean countries.

Most mainstream schools in most other countries still have punishment for misbehavior, but it usually takes non-corporal forms such as detention and suspension.

In China, school corporal punishment was completely banned under the Article 29 of the Compulsory Education Act of the People's Republic of China, but in practice, beating by schoolteachers is still common, especially in rural areas.

In Australia, school corporal punishment has been banned in public schools in all states, but as of 2019, it is still permitted in private schools in Queensland and the Northern Territory.

Detention is one of the most common punishments in schools. A pupil needs to report to a designated area of the school, at a specified time. The pupil will then have to stay at that area, for a given time.

Failure to attend detention without a valid excuse can sometimes result in another longer detention, or a more severe punishment

Counseling is also provided when students will have to see a school counselor (guidance counselor) for misbehavior. The purpose of counseling is to help the student recognize their mistakes and find ways to avoid them. Counseling can also help the student clarify the school's expectations, as well as understand the consequences of failing to meet those standards.

Suspension means that a student must not attend classes, for a given time. In some cases, the student must still come to school, but will not see classmates or teachers during that day. Students who have been suspended are also not allowed to attend out-of-school events (such as sporting events, or proms). 

Usually, schools are required to tell the student's parents why the student was suspended. 

Suspension usually means that students still need to do homework, assignments and exams.

Expulsion is the most severe form of punishment. It terminates the student's education at the given school. This is the last resort, when all other methods of discipline have failed. However, in extreme situations, it may also be used for a single offense, such as setting fires on campus, the activation of false alarms,or assault and battery against faculty and staff members,or school administrators. In some cases, there are special schools for the pupuls that have been excluded from other schools. 

Usually, the parents can appeal against the decision to expel a student.



Palm syrup

Palm syrup is made from the sap of a number of edible palms. It is common on the Canary Islands, and on the coasts of South America. It is often called Miel de palma, which translates to palm honey.

Miel de palma is used to accompany many pastries and desserts, such as pancakes and ice cream. The syrup is widely used in Southeast Asian cooking, in particular in West Bengal, where jhola gur, as it is known, is only obtainable in winter. Its sweetness tempers the flavours of spicy curries, adding its rich, molasses-like flavour to the food. It is also widely used as an ingredient in desserts, or drizzled over prepared foods.

Palm sap is a refreshing drink, and fermented palm syrup is distilled to produce various alcohols such as arrack, a spirit similar to rum. On La Gomera it is mixed with 'Parra' (similar to grappa) to produce Gomeron.

Palm syrup is also traditionally used on La Gomera for general medicinal purposes.

Faithful Word Baptist Church

Faithful Word Baptist is a fundamentalist Independent Baptist church. It is located in Tempe, Arizona and was started by a man named Steven L. Anderson.

The church has received a lot of negative attention. In 2009, Anderson said that he was praying for Barack Obama to die. Obama was the president of the United States back then. It is also homophobic and anti-Semitic. As a result of his beliefs, Anderson has been banned from many countries.

Faithful Word Baptist Church only uses the Authorized King James Version of the Bible. They believe all other Bible versions have errors in them and that the people who wrote them put in their own thoughts and ideas rather than what God wanted.

The church also believes that:

Faithful Word Baptist Church is against abortion and all forms of birth control. They believe that babies should be made naturally because processes like IVF result in a lot of embryos being thrown away. As of July 2020, Steven Anderson has 11 kids.

The church teaches that gay people are going to hell and there is nothing that they can do about it because they belong to a group of people called "reprobates." According to the church, reprobates can never be saved because they rejected Jesus too many times so God allowed them to become reprobates.

The church was started in 2005.

In August of 2009, Anderson gave a sermon called "Why I Hate Barack Obama." In it, he said that he hated Obama for supporting abortion rights and that he prayed for Obama to die.

The day after the sermon, a member of Faithful Word Baptist Church brought weapons to an event Obama was at. He did it as part of a stunt.

Anderson calls gay people "sodomites," which is a really offensive and outdated term for gays. He says that they "recruit" children through rape. He also said that killing gay people would get rid of AIDS and that he prayed for Caitlyn Jenner's heart to explode. Because of these comments, the church has been listed as a hate group by civil rights organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center.

In 2016, 49 people were killed at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Anderson called the dead people "pedophiles" and said they were all in hell.

Anderson says that the Holocaust never happened and made a video about it.

Canadian Indian residential school system

Until 1996, Indigenous children in Canada were forced to go to boarding schools in order to make them assimilate into white Canadian society. The Indian residential school system refers to the group of these schools for First Nations children. These schools were run by Christian churches and got money from the Canadian government. These schools existed for over 100 years and more than 150,000 children were in them. Of these children, at least 3,200 died.

Many residential schools were started when the Indian Act was passed in 1876. In 1896, a change was made to the Act so that all First Nations children had to go to school. A lot of their communities were located far away from schools, so they had to go to residential schools and live there for the school year. These schools were usually very far away from their families in order to encourage them to assimilate. There were residential schools in every province and territory except for New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.

At these schools, these children were forced to give up their cultures. They were given new names and were not allowed to speak their mother tongues or visit their families. They were abused at these schools and were not treated well. When these children graduated from these schools, they did not fit into their Indigenous communities or into mainstream Canadian society. They did not learn the skills needed to survive off the land. At the same time, these schools did not teach them how to skills on how to live in cities or stop the students from becoming victims of racism. Studies have shown that these students and their children and grandchildren are more likely to have problems such as PTSD, alcoholism, drug use, and suicide than kids who did not go to residential schools.

In 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized to the survivors of the residential schools on behalf of the Canadian government. The government also set up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in order to learn the truth about what happened at these schools. Many survivors came and talked about their experiences. In 2015, the TRC published a report that said the residential school system was cultural genocide.

Ever since Europeans arrived in North America, they have been trying to teach the native peoples there about European ways. The discovery doctrine that Europeans believed said that it was OK to colonize the land because the people they found were not Christian and were "uncivilized." They thought it was their duty to teach others about Christianity and civilization.

French missionaries started schools for Indigenous people in the 17th century. However, they stopped because making Indigenous people unhappy was not good for the fur trade.

In the 1820s, English missionaries started schools in what is now Manitoba and Ontario. Unlike the French schools, they taught Protestantism.

The Canadian government became interested in starting schools for Indigenous people because they were no longer allies in war. Instead, they were seen as nuisances because many of them moved around as nomads and didn't practice agriculture. The Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) partnered up with the churches to start putting more Indigenous children into the residential schools and "kill the Indian in the child" by converting them to Christianity and bringing them into European-Canadian society. The government provided the buildings and money while the church provided the teachers and staff.

Of the schools run by churches, most of them were run by the Catholic Church. Other schools were run by the Anglican Church, the United Church of Canada, and the Presbyterian Church.

The students at the schools were treated bad by the teachers and staff. They were beaten up and sexually abused. The teachers believed that beating up the students helped to save their souls and stop them from running away. It was bad for a school if students ran away because they were responsible if a student died while running away. Students were malnourished. The schools were crowded, dirty, cold, and didn't have good medical care. That meant that a lot of students ended up getting tuberculosis.

In the residential schools, students learned the same way that European kids were taught. This was very different from how First Nations people taught their kids. The Indigenous people used a "look, listen, learn" method of education that did not involve classrooms or books. Instead, they taught their kids through games, stories, and ceremonies. The kids struggled with book-learning because that was not how their parents taught them. They were also forced to speak English and French. Sometimes, they were beaten up if they spoke in their native languages.

The residential schools didn't meet their goal in extinguishing Indigenous cultures. In some cases, students burned down the schools.

A lot of students died at the schools from disease.

Many Indigenous communities began to take over the schools. They thought that the schools were not doing a good job in teaching their kids.

Some schools became normal day schools, and some schools were burned down or torn down by former students. And still others are now abandoned.

The residential school survivors lost a lot of their culture. They felt powerless. To cope with their feelings, they hurt themselves and others around them.

Many of the survivors now have mental health problems because of their experiences at the schools.

In 1986, the United Church of Canada said sorry for its part in colonization. In 1996, it apologized for running residential schools.

In 1993, the Anglican Church apologized. The next year, the Presbyterian Church apologized too.

In 2004, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) apologized for forcing children into the schools.

In 2009, Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized to the survivors of the residential schools. His apology was broadcast nationwide.

In 2009, the Vatican made a statement that expressed sorrow at how the Church was involved in oppressing Indigenous Canadians. 

In 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked Pope Francis for an apology to the survivors instead of just an expression of sorrow.

During a visit to Canada in July 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the Church's role in the Canadian Indian residential school system.

Unconventional warfare

Unconventional warfare is any kind of war that does not fit the traditional war between nations or groups. It includes foreign resistance movements and guerilla groups, who fight against an occupying force or their own government. 

In conventional warfare, the fighters usually wear uniforms, which identifies them as fighters in an army, under the laws of war. With unconventional warfare, this is not the case. Those engaging in unconventional warfare need to hide before they can launch an attack. This means that in most cases they do not wear specific uniforms which identify them as fighters. Struggles of this type are going on at present in parts of Africa.

An unconventional war is rarely announced as a war. No declaration of war is made. Usually, the only feature which is noticed is the presence in a country of organised fighters. The fighters come from a neighbouring country or from parts of the existing country. There are no set rules. 

This kind of warfare has been quite common since 1900. Terrorism is the intimidation of the native civilian population by armed fighters or insurgents, often known as "guerrillas". Warfare inside a state by citizens who wish to overthrow the state, also generally called terrorism by the government, has also been common.

Struggle between regular forces (armies in uniforms) may happen without a formal declaration of war. Red versus white after the end of royal rule in Russia (Russian Civil War) is a good example. It was a semi-formal war, fought with regular troops on both sides. So was the seizing of Manchuria (Manchukuo) by Japan in the early 1930s. Regular Japanese army forces were used.

After World War I and World War II unconventional forces were used to drive out colonial powers or to try and do so. The struggle against colonialism was usually by irregular forces supported by weapons and men from powers interested in removing the colonies (usually Russia or China).

The dividing line between conventional and unconventional warfare is not clear-cut. In general conventional war is fought between regular armies, navies, air forces. Unconventional warfare is usually fought on the ground with at least one side not in uniform, usually against forces of the established government. It is an attempt to overthrow a government or to replace in it some part of the country.


The USA Department of Defense defines unconventional warfare as activities conducted to enable a resistance movement or insurgency to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a government or occupying power by operating through or with an underground, auxiliary, and guerrilla force in a denied area. Also called UW.

R (programming language)

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistics. R is a language built for a specific purpose. It is strictly designed for statistical analysis. The algorithms for many statistical models are devised in R. Precisely R is the language of Statistical Analyzers. It’s an open source and the best suite for the statisticians to develop statistical softwares. 

The R language was originally made for statistics. But today, it is also used in many scientific fields including ecology.
A list of changes in R releases is maintained in various "news" files at CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). Some highlights are listed below for several major releases.

R has local communities worldwide for users to share ideas and learn.

There are a growing number of R events bringing its users together, such as conferences (e.g. useR!, WhyR?, conectaR, SatRdays) and other meetups.
The official annual gathering of R users is called "useR!". The first such event was useR! 2004 in May 2004, Vienna, Austria. After skipping 2005, the useR! conference has been held annually. Subsequent conferences have included:

Future conferences planned are as follows:

"The R Journal" is the open access refereed journal of the R project. It features articles on the use and development of the R language.

Mali War

The Mali War has been ongoing since 2012. The war has three sides. One side is Mali, who are supported by many other countries. Another, many of whom are Tuareg people, are separatists who want northern Mali - which they call Azawad - to become a separate country. Northern Mali is hot desert and is in the southern part of the Sahara. The third side is Islamist groups - including Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and al-Qaeda - who want Mali to be part of an Islamist caliphate.

The United Nations has reported many human rights violations, both by the forces close to the government, and by the different rebel groups. Allegedly, there have been amputations, floggings, and extrajudicial executions. A couple was stoned in 2012, for allegedly having an extramarital affair. Based on these reports, the International Criminal Court started investigations into war crimes and human rights abuses. According to the BBC, about 250,000 people have left because of the fighting. They are now refugees and internally displaced people. Another problem is that World Heritage Sites are threatened by the war. There are mosques built of mud, in Timbuktu, which are threatened. In September 2021, a contract was signed between the Malian state and a private Russian military company linked to the Russian military group Wagner. The document provides for the deployment of mercenaries in the country, in liaison with the Malian army, and the protection of senior figures.

As of 2020, the LRA is somewhat active in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. Joseph Kony leads the movement. He says he is "spokesperson" of God and a spirit medium. The movement does not want Yoweri Museveni and his government in Uganda. They want to start a theocratic state based on the Ten Commandments and Acholi tradition.

The conflict is one of the longest in Africa. It has started a humanitarian crisis. The International Criminal Court says that the LRA has violated human rights. This includes mutilation, torture, slavery, rape, the abduction (kidnapping) of civilians, the use of child soldiers, and a number of massacres. By 2004, the LRA had abducted more than 20,000 children. 1.5 million civilians had to move. The LRA killed about 100,000 civilians.

In January 1986, the National Resistance Army (NRA) of south-west Uganda born Yoweri Museveni overthrew President Tito Okello, an ethnic Acholi. This started a period of unrest. When they tried to liberate the whole country, the NRA were responsible of many atrocities on the people of Acholi. This made some Acholis want to fight against these acts. Reports sometimes say that the Acholi were afraid to lose their traditional (usual) control of the national military. They were also very worried that the NRA would want retribution for the violent counterinsurgency, especially the actions of the army in the Luwero triangle. By August 1986, a complete popular insurgency had started in northern regions that the new government soldiers occupied.

Chanie Wenjack

Chanie "Charlie" Wenjack (January 19, 1954 – October 23, 1966) was an Ojibwe boy who was famous for running away from a residential school. He died while trying to walk 600 km back home. After Wenjack's death, the Canadian government started to investigate residential schools.

Chanie Wenjack was born at Ogoki Post on the Marten Falls Reserve.

When Wenjack was 9, he and his two sisters were sent to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School in Kenora, Ontario. He was known for being funny and for being the first one to understand jokes.

On October 16, 1966, Wenjack ran away from the school with two friends, Ralph and Jackie MacDonald. They stayed with the MacDonalds' uncle, Charley Kelley, at Redditt, which is 31 km from Kenora. Wenjack decided to go back to Ogoki Post by following railroad tracks.

Wenjack walked for 36 hours. He was wearing a windbreaker. The temperature was −6 °C. Bruises on Wenjack's body showed that he fell several times.

A CN railway engineer found Wenjack's body on October 23 at 11:20AM and called the Ontario Provincial Police. The coroner determined the cause of death to be hunger and exposure.

Wenjack was buried at the reserve on October 27, 1966.

The Canadian government started an investigation into Wenjack's death. It concluded the investigation, saying that:

Chanie Wenjack is a symbol of how students at these schools stood up to the abuses and suffering they experienced there. A lecture at Trent University was named after Wenjack after Indigenous students asked for a building to be named in his honor.

In 2016, a video was made about Wenjack's life. His sister Pearl was featured in it. 

The Canadian artist Gord Downie released an album with songs about Wenjack.

Missing and murdered Indigenous women

Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) and Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) is a big problem in the United States and Canada. In both countries, Indigenous women and girls are more likely to go missing or be murdered than non-Indigenous women and girls.

The problem of MMIW reflects the intersectionality of racism and sexism Indigenous women in the US and Canada face. It also shows how the governments are not doing enough to help women.

Before colonialism, Indigenous cultures in North America treated women with respect because they were seen as givers of life. The women folk helped make important decisions in their communities.

European colonists in Canada and the US did not treat Indigenous women right. They called them names like "squaw" and thought they were immoral. European men used them for sex. Sometimes they killed the women folk. Back then, people could get away with treating Indigenous women badly because very few people at the time cared about Indigenous women like they cared about white women. To this very day, people in both countries have negative ideas about Indigenous women. Because they have those ideas, they do not treat them right.

Native Americans and Aboriginal Canadians had their cultures taken away from them. They were forced to adopt the white man's ways. The men folk learned from the white men on how to disrespect women. Also, a lot of the Indigenous people were forced to go to schools where they were treated badly. A lot of men vented out their feelings by hurting the women folk.

Indigenous communities tend to be the poorest in the US and Canada. Because of this, a lot of Indigenous women go into sex trafficking in order to make money. This allows them to be hurt by their pimps, customers, and the police. Also, few people will speak up on their behalf because there is a stigma around working in the sex industry.

Indigenous women make up 4% of the female population in Canada. Yet they represented 16% of all female homicide victims between 1980 and 2012.

The RCMP does not release data on the ethnicity of the perpetrators.

Highway 16 is in British Columbia. There is a part of Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert that is 700km long. It is known for being a place where a lot of Indigenous women have gone missing or have been found dead. A lot of people think there is a serial killer/s on the highway targeting young women.

Hitchhiking is a popular practice in this part of Canada because most people cannot afford cars and there is no good public transportation system. This puts a lot of women in danger because they might meet a driver who will do bad things to them.

In the United States, 1 in 3 Native women is assaulted during her lifetime. 67% of these assaults are done by non-Natives. Tribes have difficulty prosecuting non-Natives who hurt Natives on tribal land because their land is considered federal land. Because of this, there is a lot of confusion as whether the federal government, the state government, or the tribes should press criminal charges against non-Native perpetrators.

There have been many protests to ask for more investigations into why there are so many missing and murdered Indigenous women. People are also doing things to help find missing women because they do not believe the government will help them.

Every Valentine's Day, a march is held in Downtown Eastside, Vancouver, which is an area with a lot of missing and murdered Indigenous women. The first march was in 1991 and was held to honor a murdered Coast Salish woman.

In 2014, Tina Fontaine was found dead in the Red River in Manitoba. Since then, people have searched the rivers and ponds of Winnipeg to find bodies. Hiding bodies in water is popular with perpetrators because evidence is washed off.

A lot of art has been made to honor missing and murdered Indigenous women.

The REDress Project is an art project that is made up of red dresses. Each dress represents a missing or murdered Indigenous woman. These dresses are displayed for people to see.

Squaw

Squaw is a word that refers to an Indigenous woman in the United States or Canada.

Many Native Americans say this a bad word because people have used it in racist and woman-hating ways. According to the editor of the "Navajo Times" Tom Aviso, "squaw" is the worst word used on Native American women.
The word "squaw" comes from the Algonquian languages, where it means "woman." In the Massachusset language, the word is "squàw." In Cree, it is "iskwew."

Some people say that the word "squaw" comes from a Mohawk word that means vagina. However, many linguists, for example Ives Goddard of the Smithsonian, think this is not so. They think "squaw" really came from the regular Massachusetts word "squa," for "woman."

Squaw is considered an offensive word because many non-Natives have used it to disrespect Native American and Aboriginal Canadian women.

Some people in Indigenous communities think "squaw" is offensive. According to members of the Nooksack Tribal Council, Native Americans in general see "squaw" as an insulting word. Other Native Americans think the word should be "reclaimed", meaning made a normal word again.

The root of "squaw" is in some compound words in Algonquin languages that are spoken today: "nidobaskwa" means "female friend," "manigebeskwa" means "woman of the woods," and "Squaw Sachem" means "female chief."

European colonizers used the word to talk about Indigenous women.

When white colonists moved west, they used words like "squaw" even when they were talking about women whose tribes spoke languages different from Algonquian. It became a generic word.

European men in the US and Canada were not respectful of Indigenous women. They used them for sex. When they called the women "squaw," they used it in a way that showed that they saw those women as sex objects and not human beings. Over time, the word "squaw" came to mean a woman who was dirty, sexually abused, violent, fit only for mindless work or some group of these.

According to scholars, for example D. Francis and D. Merskin, the squaw is the second most common stereotype of Native American women. The most common is the Indian princess. The two stereotypes work as a pair. The princess was imagined as beautiful and sexually well-behaved. The squaw was imagined as ugly, dirty and sexually available.

Scholars say white people stuck to the idea of the squaw so they could say American Indian culture was bad. They pretended the cultures were full of lazy men who forced women to do all the real work. That way, they could make it sound like wiping out the culture of Native Americans was a good thing.

People in the US and Canada are trying to change place names with the word "squaw" in it because they feel it is not respectful to Indigenous women. However, there are still many places where the word is in the name.

English football league system

The English football league system is a series of leagues that are connected for men's association football clubs in England. Five teams also come from Wales, one team comes from Guernsey and one comes from Jersey. It is also called the football pyramid. The system has a hierarchical format. It has promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels. This means that in theory, even the smallest club can get to the top of the system. In the system, there are more than 140 leagues, and more than 480 divisions.

The total number of clubs changes every year. This is because clubs join and stop playing in leagues. Sometimes it is also because a club stops existing or merges with another club. An average of 15 clubs per division means that more than 7,000 teams of nearly 5,300 clubs are in a league in the English men's football league system.

There are no official definitions of any level below 11. This means that the structure at level 12 and below is not definitive.

The pyramid for women's football in England is not the same. It has nine levels. Also, some English men's football clubs play outside the English football league system.

Aston Villa director William McGregor created the (English) Football League in 1888. The biggest clubs were the ones who were in support of professionalism. The twelve first clubs were six from Lancashire (Accrington, Blackburn Rovers, Burnley, Bolton Wanderers, Everton and Preston North End) and six from the Midlands (Aston Villa, Derby County, Notts County, Stoke, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers).

The system is a pyramid of leagues. These are part of the same system through the idea of promotion and relegation. The better clubs in each league go to a higher league. The clubs that finish the season at the bottom of their league can go down to a lower league. Promotion has two important factors. The first factor is how well the club plays. The second factor is that the club needs to meet criteria set by the higher league. These criteria are often about having the right facilities and finances.

In theory, it is possible for a low level local amateur club to win promotions. Within a few years they can get to the highest level of the English game and become champions of the Premier League. In practice, this is not likely (at least not in a short period of time). However, clubs move a lot within the pyramid.

The top five levels each have one division. They are national leagues. This means clubs in these leagues play in the whole country. In level 6 and lower, the levels have more and more leagues at the same level. The lower levels are in a smaller location. Many leagues have more than one division. At the lower levels the leagues do not always exist. In some places where a lot of people live, there are leagues more than twenty levels below the Premier League. There are also leagues in different parts of the country which are not officially part of the system. This is because they do not have formal agreements with other leagues. However some county football associations accept these leagues exist. Clubs from these leagues can join a league in the system. They usually need to have the right standard of play (they need to play football well enough) and have right facilities.

The seven levels just below the Premier League and English Football League are called the National League System. The Football Association (FA) is the authority for these leagues. The system has changed over many years. The biggest change recently was when there were two new leagues at level six. These were the Conference North and Conference South (now National League North and South). This meant that the top divisions of the Southern League, Isthmian League and Northern Premier League went down to level seven. In May 2014 The FA announced provisional plans for a new division between the English Football League and the National League. This would include "B" teams (second teams) of higher-level clubs (for example, Manchester City F.C. B Team, or Liverpool F.C. B Team) . However, they changed this idea later. This meant that Premier League "B" teams could not play in the new division. Soon after this, they gave up the idea.

The English football league system does not include the amateur version of the game often called Sunday league football. These leagues are independent. They do not have promotion or relegation. They do not belong to the football pyramid. However, some Sunday league clubs sometimes join pyramid leagues. This is often if they want to play at a higher level. There are also some Saturday leagues which are not officially part of the pyramid. However, teams often leave these for pyramid leagues. The FA accepted a non-promoting Saturday league (a league with no promotion or relegation) to the pyramid in May 2017. This was the Lincolnshire League.

At the top is the single division of the Premier League (Level 1). This is often called the "top-flight". It has 20 clubs. They were all located in England until the 2010–11 season. However, two Welsh teams (Swansea City and Cardiff City) have since played in the league. Below the Premier League is the English Football League (EFL). This used to be the Football League. It has three divisions of 24 clubs each: The Championship (Level 2), League One (Level 3) and League Two (Level 4). The 20 clubs in the Premier League and the 72 clubs in the English Football League are all full-time (all the time) professional clubs. The Premier League teams are still often called 'League' clubs. This is because before 1992 the Football League, as it was called then, included all 92 clubs in four divisions. In 1992, the Premier League started, and became separate. Clubs outside this group of 92 teams are called 'non-League' clubs (i.e. non-EFL). However, they also play their football in league competitions.

The top level of non-League football is the National League. It has a national division (National League) of 24 clubs (Level 5). It is the lowest level with a single league for the whole country. This division is like the four above. It is a full-time professional competition. However, some promoted clubs keep their part-time status. There are two divisions at Level 6. They cover the north (National League North) and the south (National League South). They have 22 clubs each. Some of these clubs are full-time professional clubs. The other clubs are semi-professional. Below the National League, some of the stronger clubs are also semi-professional. However, in the lower levels, soon all the clubs are amateur. Lower-level leagues are also often for smaller regions. This is because smaller clubs don't have as much money to travel far away.

Below the National League, there are three regional leagues. Each is in a different area. Sometimes the areas are similar. They are the Northern Premier League (which covers the north of England), Southern Football League (which covers the Midlands, south and southwest of England, with one club from South Wales) and the Isthmian League (which includes clubs from the south-east of England as well as Guernsey from the Channel Islands). All of the leagues have Premier Divisions of 22 teams (Level 7). Below these, the Northern Premier League and Southern Football League each have two divisions of 20 teams (Level 8). They are in different regions. The Isthmian League has three level 8 divisions of 20 teams each as well.

Level 9 contains the top divisions of a large group of fourteen smaller than regional leagues. Each of these leagues has a different setup. They all have one thing in common: they all have leagues below them. Each covers a smaller and smaller area.


Being members of a league at a particular level also change whether a team can play certain competitions.

In the case of the FA Cup and the FA Vase, some of the clubs in the lowest level in each do not play. For example, in the 2017–18 FA Cup, there were 77 teams from Level 10 out of the 338 in total at that level.

Below Level 11 the pyramid becomes regional. The cups become regional or local. Lower down, the pyramid is based on counties. Counties have their own cups. This does not include some tournaments called "Senior Cups". These are often competitions between teams representing top professional clubs in a district. They may be little more than derbies, for example the Gloucestershire Cup. This originally included all teams in Gloucestershire, but then became a Bristol derby.

The table below shows the current structure of the system. For each division, there is its official name, sponsorship name (for levels 1–8, if it is different from its historic name) and number of clubs. At levels 1–8, each division promotes to the division that is directly above it. It relegates to the division that is directly below it. Below that level, individual league articles talk about promotion and relegation details.

The Premier League runs level one in the pyramid. It is the top division of English football. It is also called the Premier League. The winners are the champions of England. The English Football League (EFL) runs levels two to four. Together, these four divisions make up what is known as "league football".

The leagues below level four are classed as "non-League football". This means they are outside the EFL. The leagues at levels five to eleven include the National League System (NLS). They come under the direct control of the Football Association. The top-level (level 5) of the NLS is known as "step 1" by the FA, the next (level 6) as "step 2", and so on.

The system is only defined as far as level 10. What follows is a representation of one possible structure, should the system be defined further.

Ferruccio Lamborghini

Ferruccio Lamborghini (; 28 April 1916 – 20 February 1993) was an Italian industrialist. In 1963, he started Lamborghini, a maker of sports cars.

Lamborghini died at the Silvestrini Hospital in Perugia after having a heart attack fifteen days before. He was 76.

Ferruccio Lamborghini was born on April 28, 1916, to viticulturists Antonio and Evelina Lamborghini in house number 22 in Renazzo di Cento, in the Province of Ferrara, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy. According to his baptismal certificate, Ferruccio was baptised as a Roman Catholic four days later, on 2 May.

As a young man, Lamborghini was drawn more to farming machinery rather than the farming lifestyle itself. Following his interest in mechanics, Lamborghini studied at the Fratelli Taddia technical institute near Bologna. In 1940 he was drafted into the Italian Royal Air Force, where he served as a mechanic at the Italian garrison on the island of Rhodes (territory of the Kingdom of Italy since 1911, after the Italo-Turkish War), becoming the supervisor of the vehicle maintenance unit. Lamborghini was taken prisoner when the island fell to the British at the end of the war in 1945, and was not able to return home until the next year. He married, but his wife died in 1947 while giving birth to his first child, a boy named Tonino.

After World War II, Lamborghini opened a garage in Pieve di Cento. Lamborghini modified an old Fiat Topolino he had purchased (the first of many that he would own over the years) in his spare time. He made use of his mechanical abilities to transform the homely city car into a roaring 750-cc open-top two-seater and entered the car in the 1948 Mille Miglia. His participation ended after 1,100 kilometres (680 mi) when he ran the car into the side of a restaurant in the town of Fiano, in Turin.

In 1947 Ferruccio Lamborghini recognized an emerging market in post-War Italy devoted to agricultural and industrial revitalization. Using parts from military vehicle engines and differentials from ARAR centres (Azienda Recupero Alienazione Residuati), Lamborghini built the first of his "Carioca" tractors, themselves based on the six-cylinder petrol engines of Morris trucks.

As petrol in Italy was prohibitively-priced, Lamborghini augmented the Morris engines with a fuel atomiser of his own creation, which allowed the tractors to be started with petrol, then switch to the cheaper diesel fuel. Based on the initial success of the Carioca, Lamborghini founded Lamborghini Trattori and began manufacturing tractors.
Ferruccio Lamborghini between a "Jarama" and a tractor

The Iconic Riva Aquarama Lamborghini (Hull #278) was registered and delivered on 7 June 1968 to its famous owner Ferruccio Lamborghini. The boat had some specific and unique features. It was the first and only one fitted with two Lamborghini engines and it had special side railing for holding on to during waterskiing and record attempts. The engine compartment was modified to fit the engines and a special open exhaust was built just to meet Ferruccio's demands.

Ferruccio owned the boat for over 20 years until July 1988, when he then sold it to Angelo Merli, a close friend.

Several speedskiing records were broken and Ferruccio was very passionate about his Riva as part of his lifestyle and exponent of Italian craft and design, maybe even just as passionate as he was about his Miura.

Lamborghini's increasing wealth allowed him to purchase faster more expensive cars than the tiny Fiats he had tinkered with during his youth. He owned cars such as Alfa Romeos and Lancias during the early 1950s and at one point he had enough cars to use a different one every day of the week, adding a Mercedes-Benz 300SL, a Jaguar E-Type coupé, and two Maserati 3500 GTs. Of the latter, Lamborghini said, "Adolfo Orsi, then the owner of Maserati, was a man I had a lot of respect for: he had started life as a poor boy, like myself. But I did not like his cars much. They felt heavy and did not really go very fast."

In 1958, Lamborghini traveled to Maranello to buy a Ferrari 250 GT: a two-seat coupé with a body designed by coachbuilder Pininfarina. He went on to own several more over the years, including a Scaglietti-designed 250 GT SWB Berlinetta and a 250 GT 2+2 four-seater. Lamborghini thought Ferrari's cars were good, but too noisy and rough to be proper road cars. He categorized them as repurposed track cars with poorly built interiors.
Period Ferraris had spartan interiors, lacking the plush appointments Lamborghini felt were essential to a "gran turismo" car

Lamborghini found that Ferrari's cars were equipped with inferior clutches, and required continuous trips to Maranello for rebuilds; technicians would secret the car away for several hours to perform the work, much to Lamborghini's annoyance. He had previously expressed dissatisfaction with Ferrari's after sales service, which he perceived to be substandard. Lamborghini brought his misgivings to Enzo Ferrari's attention, but was dismissed by the notoriously pride-filled Modenan. After successfully modifying one of his personally-owned Ferrari 250 GTs to outperform stock models, Lamborghini gained the impetus to pursue an automobile manufacturing venture of his own, aiming to create the perfect touring car that he felt no one could build for him. Lamborghini believed that a grand tourer should have attributes that were lacking in Ferrari's offerings, namely high performance without compromising tractability, ride quality, and interior appointments. A clever businessman, Lamborghini also knew that he could make triple the profit if the components used in his tractors were installed in a high-performance exotic car instead.

During the 1970s, Ferruccio Lamborghini's companies began to run into financial difficulties. In 1971, Lamborghini Trattori, which exported around half of its production of tractors, ran into trouble when its South African importer cancelled all its orders. In Bolivia, the new military government, which had recently staged a successful coup d'état, cancelled a large order of tractors that was being prepared for shipment in Genoa. Trattori's unionised employees could not be laid off, putting immense strain on the company. In 1972, Lamborghini sold his entire holding in the company to rival tractor builder SAME.Soon, the entire Lamborghini group found itself in financial trouble. Development at the automaker slowed as costs were cut. Ferruccio Lamborghini began courting buyers for Automobili and Trattori, entering negotiations with Georges-Henri Rossetti, a wealthy Swiss businessman and friend. Ferruccio sold Rossetti 51% of the company for US$600,000, thereby relinquishing control of the automaker he had founded. He continued to work at the Sant'Agata factory; Rossetti rarely involved himself in Automobili's affairs.

The situation did not improve: the 1973 oil crisis plagued sales of high performance cars of manufacturers from around the world. Consumers flocked to smaller, more practical modes of transportation with better fuel economy. By 1974, Ferruccio had become disenchanted with his car business. He severed all connections with the cars that bore his name, selling his remaining 49% stake in the automaker. The shares were acquired by René Leimer, a friend of Georges-Henri Rossetti.

After departing the automobile manufacturing business, Lamborghini continued his business activities in other areas, including his heating and air conditioning company, Lamborghini Calor. In 1969, he founded Lamborghini Oleodinamica S.p.A., a manufacturer of hydraulic valves and equipment.

In 1974, Lamborghini exited the industrial world and retired to a 3 km (740 acres) estate named "La Fiorita" on the shores of Lake Trasimeno, in Castiglione del Lago, a town in the Umbria region of central Italy. Returning to his farming roots, Lamborghini delighted in hunting and producing his own wines. Lamborghini even designed his own golf course, all while continuing to manage several business interests.

Lamborghini fathered a child, Patrizia, at age 58.

At 76 years of age, on February 20, 1993, Lamborghini died at Silvestrini Hospital in Perugia after suffering a heart attack fifteen days earlier. Lamborghini is buried at the cemetery of Renazzo.

The world of bullfighting is a key part of Lamborghini's identity. In 1962, Ferruccio Lamborghini visited the Seville ranch of Don Eduardo Miura, a renowned breeder of Spanish fighting bulls. Lamborghini, a Taurus himself, was so impressed by the majestic Miura animals that he decided to adopt a raging bull as the emblem for the auto company he would soon found.

After producing two cars with alphanumeric designations, Lamborghini once again turned to the bull breeder for inspiration. Don Eduardo was filled with pride when he learned that Ferruccio had named a car for his family and their line of bulls; the fourth Miura to be produced was unveiled to him at his ranch in Seville.

The car manufacturer would continue to draw upon the bullfighting connection in future years. The Islero was named for the Miura bull that killed the famed bullfighter Manolete in 1947. "Espada" is the Spanish word for sword, sometimes used to refer to the bullfighter himself. The Jarama's name carried a special double meaning; intended to refer only to the historic bullfighting region in Spain, Ferruccio was concerned about confusion with the also historic Jarama motor racing track. 

After naming the Urraco after a bull breed, in 1974, Lamborghini broke from tradition, naming the Countach not for a bull, but for "contacc", a Piedmontese exclamation of astonishment. Legend has it that stylist Nuccio Bertone uttered the word in surprise when he first laid eyes on the Countach prototype, "Project 112". The LM002 sport utility vehicle and the Silhouette were other exceptions to the tradition.

The Jalpa of 1982 was named after a bull breed; Diablo, after the Duke of Veragua's ferocious bull famous for fighting an epic battle against "El Chicorro" in Madrid in 1869; Murciélago, the legendary bull who survived 28 sword strokes and whose life was spared by "El Lagartijo" for his performance in 1879; Gallardo, named after one of the five ancestral castes of the Spanish fighting bull breed; and Reventón, the bull that defeated young Mexican "torero" Félix Guzmán in 1943. The Estoque concept of 2008 was named after the estoc, the sword traditionally used by "matadors" during bullfights, while the replacement for the Murcielago, the Aventador (unveiled in 2011) was named after a bull that was bred by the sons of Don Celestino Cuadri Vides. This bull was killed in a particularly gruesome fight, where after the bull was killed, its left ear was cut off and given to the Matador as a token of good luck.

All of Ferruccio Lamborghini's companies continue to operate today in one form or another. His son, Tonino, designs a collection of clothing and accessories under the Tonino Lamborghini brand, as well as designing the Town Life, an electric microcar which was revealed at the Bologna Motor Show in 1999. Ferruccio's daughter, Patrizia Lamborghini, runs the Lamborghini winery on his Umbria estate. In 1995 Ferruccio's son Tonino opened a museum that honors Lamborghini's legacy, the "Centro Studi e Ricerche Ferruccio Lamborghini" in Dosso (Ferrara), which was moved to Argelato (Bologna) in 2014 with the new name Ferruccio Lamborghini Museum

List of chancellors of Germany

The chancellor of Germany is the political leader of Germany. They choose all other members of the government and lead cabinet meetings.

The office first started in the North German Confederation in 1867. Otto von Bismarck became the first chancellor. The unification of Germany and start of the German Empire in 1871 meant that the Confederation changed into a German country. Its leader was called chancellor of Germany.

At first, the chancellor was only an advisor to the emperor. The emperor chose the chancellor. Later this changed. Under the 1919 Weimar Constitution, the elected President chose the chancellor. In Nazi Germany, politicians ignored the constitution. The chancellor became a dictator under Adolf Hitler. During Allied occupation, there was no chancellor in East or West Germany. This changed after the 1949 Basic Law. This made the chancellor the most important job in the government. The president became less important.

The North German Confederation started after the German Confederation ended. This happened because Prussia won the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. The Prussian king chose the Chancellor.

Political party

The German Empire started from the North German Federation because of the Franco-Prussian War. The new Emperor named the chancellor to advise him.

Political parties

On 9 November 1918, chancellor Max von Baden gave his office to Friedrich Ebert. Ebert continued to be the head of government during the three months between the end of the German Empire in November 1918 and the start of the National Assembly in February 1919. He was Chairman of the Council of the People's Deputies together with USPD Leader Hugo Haase.

Political party

The Weimar Constitution of 1919 started the Weimar Republic. The chancellors often needed support from the President.

Political parties

Adolf Hitler's (taking power) was the end of the Weimar Republic. It was the beginning of Nazi Germany. Hitler was dictator and had all the power.

Political parties

In 1949, two separate German countries started: the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The list below gives the chancellors of "West Germany". The Chairman of the Council of Ministers controlled the government of East Germany. In 1990, East Germany ended. It merged with West Germany. It kept the name "Federal Republic of Germany".

Glock 18

The Glock 18 is a selective-fire (which means it can fire either semi-automatic or full automatic mode), polymer-framed 9x19mm Parabellum pistol. It is based on the Glock 17, but unlike the Glock 17, it can fire in full automatic mode. It normally holds 33-round box magazines and it fires 1,200 rounds per minute. In other words, the gun fires so quickly that it is impossible to fire single shots when in full automatic mode. While it is light enough to fire with one hand, it is not a good idea because its fast rate of fire makes the gun kick back a lot.

Milne big-eyed tree frog

The Milne big-eyed tree frog ("Nyctimystes persimilis") is a tree frog from Papua New Guinea. Scientists saw it on Mount Dayman and Mount Simpson between 1370 and 1400 meters above sea level. It lives in forests and wetlands not near the ocean.

This frog is about 40 mm long from nose to rear end. When alive, this frog is light brown with green or brown patches or olive gray with dark brown patches. Preserved, dead frogs are dark purple-gray, but the preservative may have made it darker than a living frog. This frog has teeth in its upper jaw. 

Navajo Times

The Navajo Times is a newspaper. It is written in English for the Navajo people, a group of Native Americans who live in the southwestern United States. It tells Navajo people about events that affect their lives, both in Navajo territory and in the rest of the United States. Its main offices are in Window Rock, Arizona. It also has another office in Shiprock, New Mexico.

The newspaper is owned by the Navajo Times Publishing Company, Inc., a for-profit corporation. NTPC Inc. belongs to the Navajo people, and the Tribal Council are its caretakers. Tommy Arviso Jr. is President and CEO of NTPC. The paper earns enough money from selling newspapers and from advertising to pay for its own costs and a little profit. In 2015, Arviso said one of the paper's goals was to become a completely privately owned company with individual Navajo people owning shares.

Arviso said the "Navajo Times" does not print "sensational" stories: "We do not prey on the hurt, sadness, pain and sorrow of other humans to increase paper sales."

The "Navajo Times" started as a newsletter in 1959. The Navajo Tribal Council began it. They wanted to be able to talk to people living on Navajo land and people living in other places, for example Navajo students away at school. It became a newspaper the following year, in 1960. At first, it was a monthly newsletter, then weekly. In the early 1960s, the paper covered infrastructure-related stories like health care, education, and economic development. As of 2020, the first few years of the paper are archived in the Arizona Memory Project.

When Arviso became editor of the paper in 1988 he said there were problems with censorship. Because the paper was run by the government of the Navajo nation, the Navajo leaders believed they should choose what the paper could and could not print. In 2003, Arviso convinced the Tribal Council to make the paper more independent. They voted 66 to 1 to create the Navajo Times Publishing Company so the paper would be more independent.

In 2012, the "Navajo Times" staff won 13 awards from the Arizona Press Club.

In 2015 "Navajo Times" staff won 24 Native Media Awards from the Native American Journalists Association, including awards for photography, sports and writing. They also won Best Layout. The paper changed its layout in 2015.

In 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, the "Navajo Times" won Newspaper of the Year from the Arizona Newspapers Association in the category for non-daily newspapers. It also won awards for its website and advertising.

Liberal arts college

A liberal arts college is a college with an emphasis on undergraduate study in the liberal arts and sciences. These colleges try to teach broad general knowledge, different from colleges that focus on job skills. Students in a liberal arts college often major in one subject but take classes in many subjects, including both humanities and sciences. The idea of liberal arts began in Europe, but liberal arts colleges are mostly found in the United States.

In 2019, the top ten liberal arts colleges in the United States, according to "U.S. News & World Report", were Amherst College, Bowdoin College, Carleton College, Claremont McKenna College, Davidson College, Middlebury College, Pomona College, Swarthmore College, Wellesley College, and Williams College.

Many liberal arts colleges teach only undergraduate students, but some also offer graduate programs that lead to a master's degree or doctoral degree. The term "liberal arts college" most often describes an independent college, but it may also sometimes describe a college within a larger university. Most liberal arts colleges outside the United States are like this.

Pedro Cateriano

Pedro Álvaro Cateriano Bellido (born June 26, 1958) is a Peruvian lawyer and politician. In July 2020, he became the Prime Minister of Peru under Martín Vizcarra's administration. He left the position on 6 August 2020. He was Ollanta Humala's Minister of Defense from July 2012 to April 2015, and Prime Minister from April 2015 to July 2016.

Born in the capital city of Lima in 1958, Cateriano pursued a law degree at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, specializing in constitutional law. During his brief term in the Peruvian Congress between 1990 and 1992, Cateriano attained a prominent role as a ranking member of the congressional investigative committee on Alan García's first administration (1985-1990). Alongside Lourdes Flores and Fernando Olivera, the committee was ultimately disbanded following García's acquittal by the Supreme Court in March 1992. Cateriano published in the following years a detailed work on the investigation.

After a failed run for the Peruvian Congress, Cateriano worked extensively in opposition to Alberto Fujimori's presidency, ultimately being appointed to the Constitutional Reform Advisory Body of the Ministry of Justice in the presidency of Valentín Paniagua. Subsequently, he was appointed under Alejandro Toledo's presidency as Deputy Minister of Justice, serving until his resignation in June 2002, alongside minister and former colleague, Fernando Olivera.

During the presidency of Ollanta Humala, Cateriano served as Minister of Defense from July 2012 to April 2015. In his almost three-year tenure, he remained a controversial member of Humala's administration, constantly clashing with the opposition regarding the government's modus operandi, in which First Lady Nadine Heredia seemingly interfered with government decisions. He also faced criticism for his support of pecuniary sanctions on voluntary military service enrollment, which the Constitutional Court declared the measure unconstitutional. Upon the resignation of Ana Jara on 2 April 2015, due to her being censured by the Peruvian Congress regarding illegal government espionage under her management as Prime Minister of Peru, Cateriano was appointed as her successor. Seemed by pundits as a government loyalist, he served through the end of Humala's presidency.

Cateriano was sworn as Prime Minister of Peru on 15 July 2020, succeeding Vicente Zeballos as the government faces strong criticism due to Vizcarra's management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. He would serve until 4 August 2020, less than three weeks in office, as Congress voted against his confirmation and left office on 6 August 2020.

Browning Hi-Power

The Browning Hi-Power is a semi-automatic pistol first made by John Browning, then finished by FN Herstal (a Belgian gun company) in 1935 after Browning's death. There are 9x19mm Parabellum models and .40 S&W models of the gun. Although the gun was largely based on the M1911, there were several major changes made. Since it was finished outside the United States and since it fired the non-American 9mm bullet, the Hi-Power was not used very much in the US. However, it was very popular outside the US. In fact, it was one of the most used military pistols ever. As of 2017, it was still being used or was only recently replaced in over 50 countries.

The Browning Hi-Power has many other names such as the HP, BAP, BHP, GP, P-35, and HP-35. It was called the "Hi-Power" because it could hold a large number of bullets. It could hold 13 9mm bullets when other pistols at the time held far fewer. For example, the Luger only held 8 bullets and the M1911 only held 7.

Floater

Floaters or eye floaters are small dots in the field of vision of a person. They are transparent and between the eye's vitreous humour or between the vitreous and retina. Their medical name is "muscae volitantes" (Latin for 'flying flies'), or "mouches volantes" (French for 'flying flies'). All people will get them over time, but not all will notice them. Nearsighted people can notice them earlier. It might be possible to get these by debris falling into the eye. 
The vitreous, a jelly-like material inside the eyeball, becomes more liquid. This happens when people age. But young people can also get them. When this happens, small collagen fibers and vitreous form to clumps. These clumps throw shadows onto the retina. These shadows are floaters.

Laser vitreolysis is a possible treatment option for the removal of floaters.

Kokoda big-eyed tree frog

The Kokoda big-eyed tree frog ("Nyctimystes semipalmatus") is a tree frog from Papua New Guinea. Scientists saw it in the Owen Stanley Mountains between Garaina and Mount Dayman, at 300 to 700 meters above sea level. It lives in forests and wetlands not near the ocean.

Scientists looked at preserved, dead frogs. Among these, the largest adult male frog was 8.4 cm long from nose to rear end but most were closer to 6.4 cm long. The females were about 5.9 to 8.0 cm long. The dead frogs were gray and brown, but the preservative may have changed their color. Scientists who wrote about this preserved frog years ago said it looked pink.

One female frog laid 400 eggs at one time. They were 2.6 mm in diameter. They were cream-colored.

Cryptographic anchor

A cryptographic anchor (also "crypto-anchor") is a unique identifier (or "fingerprint") that can be put into products and cannot be removed or changed. Crypto-anchors can be tiny computers or optical codes. This means they can even be put into a dye. The cryptographic anchor is connected to a blockchain. Its uses include prevention or detection of fraud as well as product tracing.

IBM has worked on developing cryptographic anchors. Proposed uses include labeling a pill (the code for the dye would become visible when touched with water) and marking fluids. The reason for using these anchors is to ensure the authenticity of products. The suggested cost of these tiny (smaller than a salt grain) items was projected at less than ten U.S. cents.

Giulio Prisco wrote that "The cryptographic anchors project is considered a starting point for developing technologies complementary to the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain solutions for medical devices and pharmaceutical products, able to provide scalable end-to-end security across a supply chain — from the manufacturers right down to consumers and patients.<Br>

"A typical application envisioned by IBM is fighting product fraud. IBM’s crypto-anchors can authenticate a product’s origin and contents, ensuring it matches the record stored in the blockchain."

Prisco wrote that in 2018 IBM was predicting widespread use within five years.

FN P90

The FN P90 is a very short personal defense weapon made by FN Herstal. It was made to replace 9x19mm Parabellum submachine guns in NATO because NATO needed a small automatic weapon for non-combat specialists to protect themselves and could shoot through body armor. The P90 shoots the FN 5.7x28mm bullet, the same bullet as the FN Five-seven pistol. It is a small, high-velocity bullet that can shoot through body armor. The P90 has a rare feature where the box magazine is loaded parallel to the gun's barrel rather than perpendicular to it. Each magazine can hold 50 bullets. The P90 fires at a fast 900 rounds per minute (RPM). The P90 is fully ambidextrous, which means both right-handed and left-handed people can use the gun without any problems. It weighs only 2.6 kilograms (5.6 pounds) and is only 50.5 centimeters (19.9 inches) long. It is even small and light enough to fire with one hand. The P90 is very common in militaries and police forces in NATO countries. A semi-automatic only version called the PS-90 can be bought and used for civilian purposes.

FN 5.7×28mm

The FN 5.7×28mm is a pistol-sized, armor-piercing bullet made by the Belgian gun company FN Herstal. FN Herstal made the bullet because NATO wanted a pistol-sized round that could replace the 9×19mm Parabellum bullet, since the 9mm cannot shoot through most body armor. However, the FN 5.7×28mm never completely replaced the 9mm because Germany vetoed the decision. It has a similar design to the 5.56x45mm NATO because it is small, but has a lot of stopping power, accuracy, and penetration because of its high velocity. Guns that use the FN 5.7×28mm include the FN P90 and the FN Five-seven.

FN Five-seven

The FN Five-seven, marketed as the Five-seveN, is an armor-piercing semi-automatic pistol made by the Belgian gun company FN Herstal. It fires the FN 5.7x28mm bullet, where the gun itself gets its name. It was made around the same time as the FN P90 PDW. Although the FN 5.7x28mm bullet is small, it has low recoil, high stopping power, high accuracy, armor-piercing abilities, and long range because of its high muzzle velocity. The small size of the bullet also allows for the gun's box magazines to hold many bullets, with a normal magazine holding 20 bullets. It is popular with militaries and police forces worldwide. However, its ability to shoot through body armor and the high number of bullets it can carry make it a very controversial gun in the United States for civilian use. The Five-seven can be seen in video games like the "Splinter Cell" series, "Counter-Strike", the "Rainbow Six" series, the "Battlefield" (series), and the "Call of Duty" series.

Rethel

Rethel () is a commune in the Ardennes department in northern France. It is a sub-prefecture and third-most important city and economic center in the department. It is situated on the river Aisne, near the northern border of Champagne and 37 km from Reims.

Its inhabitants are called "Rethélois."

According to legend, the city was founded by Julius Caesar, who established a camp on the site of the city during his campaigns. The parents of St. Arnulf of Metz were said to have given all they owned "in villa Reistete" (in the city of Rethel) to St. Remigius, bishop of Reims, so that their prayers for a child would be answered. The city belonged to the Abbey of Saint-Remi and was administered by its advocati. One of them, Manasses I, became the first Count of Rethel. In 1481 the county, with Rethel as its seat, became the Peerage of France; it became a duchy in 1581 and in 1663 it became the Duchy of Mazarin. During the Franco-Spanish War it was captured by Spanish forces under Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé on October 30, 1652 after a four-year siege, but was retaken by the French in July 1653. In 1814 Spanish prisoners of war from the Napoleonic Wars introduced typhus to the city. Jean-Baptiste Reberotte-Labesse cared for the soldiers who were ill. Cholera epidemics occurred in 1832 and 1849, while typhoid fever ravaged the city in 1839, with an average of thirty deaths a day. During World War II Rethel was the site of heavy combat from May to June 1940 during the Battle of France. French troops under Jean de Lattre de Tassigny repelled German assaults on the town for a month before it fell.

It is a heavily changed version of the G3 rifle. The Munich massacre during the 1972 Summer Olympics showed the need for West German police and counter-terrorists to have a precision rifle, which West Germany did not have at the time.

The PSG-1 is very accurate and has a large 20-round box magazine. However, its heavy weight, high price, lack of versatility, and its ease of jamming made the rifle not very practical, so it was eventually replaced by other sniper rifles. However, its unique look made it a popular weapon in video games. It appeared in games like the "Metal Gear" series, the "Call of Duty" series, the "Rainbow Six" series, and "Resident Evil 5".

Mary L. Trump

Mary Lea Trump (born May 1965) is an American psychologist, businessperson, and author. She is a niece of President Donald J. Trump. She wrote "Too Much and Never Enough", a book about him and the Trump family, in 2020. It sold over one million copies on its first day on sale.

Mary Trump was born to Fred Trump Jr. and Linda Lee Clapp. Her brother is Frederick Trump III. Her father died of alcoholism when she was 16.

Trump studied English literature at Tufts University. She earned a PhD in clinical psychology.

Trump married a woman and divorced her soon. She has a daughter.

Trump is a psychologist. She has also taught college-level classes on psychology and has run some small businesses on the side.

Mary Trump wrote Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man. It is a book that reveals how Donald Trump became what she calls "the world's most dangerous man." It was published on July 14, 2020. The book sold more than one million copies on its first day of sales.

Too Much and Never Enough

Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man is a book written by Mary L. Trump, the niece of Donald Trump. It is a "tell-all" book, which means it is a biography about Donald Trump written without his permission. The Trump family filed a lawsuit against the book by saying it violated a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). An NDA means that a person cannot reveal confidential information to the public. However, they could not stop the book from being published on July 14, 2020.

Mary Trump is a psychologist who works with patients. She has done research on victims of stalking and on schizophrenia. She is the daughter of Fred Trump, Jr. and granddaughter of Fred Trump.

In 1999, Mary and her brother Fred III went to court because they didn't agree with the conditions in Fred Sr.'s will. They said that Fred Sr.'s other children influenced him so that the will would not give them as much money as they think they deserved. Because they went to trial, the family cut off both of them from health insurance, which put Fred's son, who had epilepsy, in great danger. The lawsuit was settled and they got their insurance back.

After her uncle became president, there were questions about whether or not he paid his fair share in taxes. Mary gave "The New York Times" a box of financial documents that proved that he did not and that he was engaged in fraud.

This book is chronological. That means it is organized by time. Mary doesn't diagnose Donald with any specific disorders. Instead she uses psychology to analyze parts of his history to give suggestions on what might be wrong with him.

This part of the book describes Fred Trump as a sociopath who uses others to help himself. Donald learns from Fred how to not show feelings of weakness nor how to be kind to others. This is in contrast to Fred Jr., who was constantly scolded for not learning to be a cruel person like Fred Sr. Because of this training, Donald fails to learn about all the possible feelings that people experience. To the relief of his mother, he is sent to military school.

In Part 2, Donald becomes a businessman. However, Fred Sr. puts Donald as the public face of the family business while he takes care of much of the actual business. Fred Jr. chooses to leave the family business and become a pilot. He is rejected by his family for this choice, which leads to him becoming an alcoholic and the end of his pilot career and his marriage. He died of a heart attack at a hospital while Donald was at a movie theater.

This part of the books talks about how Donald is not a good businessman. The only reason he is not allowed to fail is because his businesses partners won't let him; him failing makes them look bad. At one point, he has to negotiate with creditors so that he can get an allowance of $450,000 per month.

The family cuts her and her brother out of Fred's will. She, her brother, and her brother's son lose their health insurance. They settle when she allows the rest of the family to buy out her share of a corporation at a price lower than what it should be.

Here, Mary talks about Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. She uses her psychologist knowledge to show how he used his worst traits to his own advantage. She says that Donald is able to be manipulated by others who recognize his weaknesses.

Mary Trump makes some claims in the book. She says that:

The book was supposed to be published by Simon & Schuster on August 11, 2020. However, they moved the publication date to July 14 because so many people wanted to read it.

Donald Trump said that Mary signed a "very powerful" agreement that "covers everything," so she was "not allowed to write a book."

Robert Trump, one of Mary's uncles, sued on June 23 to stop the book from being published. A judge in the Queens County Surrogate Court (a court that handles wills) dismissed the case. Trump then took the case to a state court. On June 30, a judge there ordered that the book not be published until a hearing was held on July 10. On July 1, another more powerful judge reversed that order and allowed Simon & Schuster to publish the book. On July 2, Mary Trump made an affidavit saying that she was not bound by the NDA because the agreement was fraudulent.

Most people said good things about the book. They were impressed with how she used her psychology knowledge to tell a story about her family.

One man, Chris Taylor, said she did not write a good book because she made a lot of big claims and contradicted herself.

History of the creation–evolution controversy

The creation–evolution controversy has a long history. Scientists had some ideas how evolution works. Because these theories contradict the creation myth in the Book of Genesis, religious people and organizations questioned these ideas. For a long time, only the priests could read the Bible, which was written in Latin or in Greek. It was only the priests who interpreted the texts in the Bible. The priests often said that the Book of Genesis should not be read literally and taught it as an allegory. With the advent of the printing press, the Bible was translated into other languages. More people were able to read and write, and more literal understandings of scripture flourished. This allowed some religious persons and groups to challenge scientists who supported evolution, such as biologists Thomas Henry Huxley and Ernst Haeckel.

 The first people to speak about evolution were Empedocles and other Greek philosophers in Europe (5th century BCE) andTaoism in Asia. The history of evolutionary thought in Christian theology dates back to Augustine of Hippo (4th century) and Thomas Aquinas (13th century). The modern creation–evolution controversy started in Europe and North America in the late 18th century. Discoveries in geology led to various theories of an ancient earth, and fossils showing past extinctions prompted early ideas of evolution. These ideas were particularly controversial in England, where both the natural world and the hierarchical social order were thought to be fixed by God's will. As the terrors of the French Revolution developed into the Napoleonic Wars, followed by economic depression threatening revolution in Great Britain itself, these ideas were rejected, associated only with radical agitators.
When the economy recovered, things improved. When the book "Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation" was anonymously published in 1844 its ideas of transmutation of species attracted wide public interest. The work was attacked by the scientific establishment and many theologians who believed it to be in conflict with their interpretations of the biblical account of life's, especially humanity's, origin and development. However, radical Quakers, Unitarians and Baptists welcomed the book's ideas of "natural law" as supporting their struggle to overthrow the privileges of the Church of England.

"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation" remained a best-seller- It paved the way for widespread interest in the theory of natural selection. English naturalist Charles Darwin introduced this ideas in his 1859 book, "On the Origin of Species". Darwin's book was praised by Unitarians as well as by liberal Anglican theologians. The theologians' book "Essays and Reviews" (1860) was more controversial in Britain than Darwin's. It questioned the historical accuracy of literal interpretations of the Bible and said that miracles were irrational.

Darwin's book revolutionized the way naturalists viewed the world. The book and its promotion attracted attention and controversy, and many theologians reacted to Darwin's theories. For example, in his 1874 work "What is Darwinism?" the theologian Charles Hodge argued that Darwin's theories were like atheism. Thomas Henry Huxley, added to the controversy when he wrote that Christianity is a "...compound of some of the best and some of the worst elements of Paganism and Judaism. [influenced by] certain people of the Western world..." Perhaps the most uncompromising of the evolutionary philosophers was Ernst Haeckel, who dogmatically affirmed that nothing spiritual exists.

A fundamental change in the Protestant objections to evolution occurred after about 1875. Previously, citing Louis Agassiz and other scientific luminaries, Protestant contributors to religious quarterlies dismissed Darwin's theories as unscientific. After 1875, it became clear that the majority of naturalists were in favor of evolution, and a sizable minority of these Protestant contributors rejected Darwin's theory because it called into question the veracity of Scriptures. Even so, virtually none of these dissenters insisted on a young Earth.

The greatest concern for creationists in the late 19th century was the issue of human ancestry. In the words of an 1896 religious tract:

Creationists during this period were largely premillennialists; their belief in Christ's return depended on a quasi-literal reading of the Bible. However, they were not as concerned about geology, freely granting scientists any time they needed before the Edenic creation to account for scientific observations, such as fossils and geological findings. In the immediate post-Darwinian era, few scientists or clerics rejected the antiquity of the earth or the progressive nature of the fossil record. Likewise, few attached geological significance to the Biblical flood, unlike subsequent creationists. Evolutionary skeptics, creationist leaders and skeptical scientists were usually either willing to adopt a figurative reading of the first chapter of Genesis, or allowed that the six days of creation were not necessarily 24-hour days.

The reaction in the United States matched the developments in Britain, and when Alfred Russel Wallace went there for a lecture tour in 1886–1887 his explanations of "Darwinism" were welcomed without any problems, but attitudes changed after the First World War. The controversy became political when public schools began teaching that man evolved from earlier forms of life per Darwin's theory of natural selection. In response, the U.S. state of Tennessee passed the Butler Act of 1925 prohibiting the teaching of any theory of the origins of humans that contradicted the teachings of the Bible. This law was tested in the highly publicized Scopes Trial of 1925. The law was upheld by the Tennessee Supreme Court, and remained on the books until 1967 when it was repealed. In 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in "Epperson v. Arkansas" that banning the teaching of specific theories contravened the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution because their primary purpose was religious.

John C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris' influential "The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications" was published in 1961. The authors argued that creation was literally six days long, that humans lived at the same time as dinosaurs, and that God created each kind of life. When it was published, Morris became a popular speaker, spreading anti-evolutionary ideas at fundamentalist churches, colleges, and conferences. Morris set up the Creation Science Research Center , an organization dominated by Baptists, as part of the Christian Heritage College. The CSRC rushed publication of biology text books that promoted creationism. These efforts were against the recommendations of Morris, who urged a more cautious and scientific approach. Ultimately, the CSRC broke up, and Morris founded the Institute for Creation Research in 1970. Morris promised that the ICR, unlike the CSRC, would be controlled and operated by scientists. During this time, Morris and others who supported flood geology, adopted the scientific sounding terms "scientific creationism" and "creation science". The flood geologists effectively co-opted "the generic creationist label for their hyperliteralist views." Previously, "creationism" was a generic term describing a philosophical perspective that presupposes the existence of a supernatural creator.

Among the first recorded responses of a prominent Roman Catholic clergyman to Darwin's theory was that of the Blessed John Henry Newman, who in 1868, in a letter to a fellow priest, made the following comments:
Some point to the fact that before ordination all Catholic priests have to study the teachings of Thomas Aquinas, who subscribed to an Aristotelian view of evolution, in which he says that animal species evolve by means of mutations and natural law.

More recent statements have been made by Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI that also support a theistic understanding of evolution.

The controversy continues to this day. Creationist organizations actively attack the scientific consensus on the origins and evolution of life. Many religious groups want to promote other forms of creationism (usually young Earth creationism, creation science, old Earth creationism or intelligent design ) as an alternative. Most of these groups are explicitly Christian, and more than one sees the debate as part of the Christian mandate to evangelize.

Some see science and religion as views that are so different that they cannot be reconciled. Mainstream churches and some scientists consider science and religion to be separate categories of thought, which ask fundamentally different questions about reality and propose different ways of investigating it.

More recently, the intelligent design movement has taken an anti-evolution position which avoids any direct appeal to religion. Leonard Krishtalka, a paleontologist and an opponent of the movement, has called intelligent design "nothing more than creationism in a cheap tuxedo," and, in "Kitzmiller v.Dover Area School District" (2005) United States District Judge John E. Jones III ruled that "intelligent design is not science," but is "grounded in theology" and "cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents." Before the trial began, U.S. President George W. Bush commented endorsing the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolution "I felt like both sides ought to be properly taught ... so people can understand what the debate is about." Scientists argue that intelligent design does not represent any research program within the scientific community, and is opposed by most of the same groups who oppose creationism.


The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)

The Green Book ( al-Kitāb al-Aḫḍar) is a book written by Muammar al-Gaddafi, who was the leader of Libya until 2011. It explains his social and political philosophy. He wanted everyone to read the book because he believed that his philosophy could make the world a better place. It was first published in 1975.
"The Green Book" was very important in Libya. Schoolchildren would spend 2 hours a week learning about it.
By 1993, colleges all around the world were having lectures and seminars about The Green Book.

The books has 110 pages. It is divided into 3 parts:

The book is against both capitalism and communism. Gaddafi was against communism because he thought it was not respectful to religion. Instead, he promoted Islamic socialism.

It also rejects representative democracy.

The table below gives a chapter-by-chapter summary of the book:

A lot of people thought that Gadaffi didn't do a good job writing the book. They thought that the book was a bunch of proverbs rather than something with new and unique ideas or a strong argument.


Cheesman's big-eyed tree frog

Cheesman's big-eyed tree frog ("Nyctimystes cheesmani") is a tree frog from southeastern Papua New Guinea.

The adult male frog is 47.6 to 56.5 mm long from nose to rear end, and the adult female frog is 54.7 to 65.0 mm long. It can be light brown to dark brown or green-brown in color. It has very dark eyes. It has purple color on some parts of its body. It has vomerine teeth in its upper jaw.

Scientists found this frog in streams in forests that were open enough for the sunlight to come through.

In 2020, the International Commission of Zoological Nomenclature considered calling the frog "cheesmanae" but decided not to.

Flat-headed cat

The flat-headed cat ("Prionailurus planiceps") is a wildcat that lives in Indonesia and Malaysia. It used to live in Thailand but may be extinct there.

This cat is 45 to 52 cm long (18 to 20 inches) and its tail is another 12 to 17 cm long (4.7 to 7 inches). It weights 1.5 to 2.5 kilograms (3.3 to 5.5 pounds). It is about the size of a domestic cat but its legs and tail are shorter, its body is longer, its paws are rounder, and its head is flatter. Its fur is red-brown and dark brown and it has white marks on its face and a white belly. Unlike most cats' claws, the flat-headed cat's claws do not retract all the way.

The flat-headed cat lives in low rainforests, swamps, lakes, and forests with rivers in them. It catches its food in the water, and its body helps: Its teeth point backwards in its mouth so fish cannot get away. Its jaws are longer and narrower than other cats' jaws. It has some webbing between its toes.

Some scientists think this cat likes water even more than the fishing cat does. When some scientists studying apes caught a flat-headed cat by accident, they let it go between a forest and a river. The cat ran to the river and dove in instead of running to the trees to hide. The scientists thought that the cat felt safer in the water than in the trees.

Like other cats, the flat-headed cat sprays urine to mark its territory, but while other cats stand up and spray onto a tall object like a tree. The flat-headed cat crouches down and sprays while it walks, leaving its urine on the ground.

The flat-headed cat is pregnant for 56 days. Female cats have one to four kittens at a time. In zoos, a flat-headed cat can live 14 years.

Flat-headed cats are endangered because of pollution and because humans catch too many fish but mostly because humans have cut down the forests to build farms. Flat-headed cats like forests that are not too far above sea level, and this makes good farmland, so humans want it. Some scientists think that flat-headed cats can live in forests that have grown back after being cut down. Scientists do not think the flat-headed cat can hunt and live near farms the way the Iriomote cat does.

Contern

Contern () is a commune in Luxembourg. It is part of the canton of Luxembourg. As of 2021, 3,968 people in the commune of Contern but the town itself in the middle of the commune is home to 1743 people as of 2022. The other villages in Contern are Moutfort, Oetrange, Medingen and Milbech. Contern also has various hamlets

The Romans settled the country of Luxembourg in the BC era and at some point a road was constructed between Luxembourg City and Dalheim. This road passed through what is today within the borders of the commune of Contern and also through the settlement of Faerschthaff. The Construction of this road saw a bridge of the Trudlerbaach River constructed, which still remains today. There is no proof that the settlement of Contern was founded during roman times, although it is widely believed so. The name Contern was first seen in a charter in 879/880/903/904 AD, although its first official listing was in 1128 and it is almost certain Contern dated back to the Era. In the 14th century it was wirtten as "Guntrein." Contern in the 13th century got a lot of influence from Christianity and Chivalry. At this time Contern became a parish and has its church built. From 1945 onwards, Contern's municipal structure was made up of Contern, Oetrange, Moutfort and Medingen. The Commune of Contern has existed since the 19th century

Contern was formed as a parish in 1621. Later in 1684, neighbouring Oetrange became a parish and in 1707, Moutfort followed. At the time, the parish of Contern had no Lieu-dits although Oetrange was home to the settlement of Kackerterhaff. Moutfort was home to the setlements of Medingen and Millbech as well as the Moulin the Millbech and the farmstead of Pleitrange. By 1796 Contern was founded as an Arrondissement, this was home to several localities:

Contern remained as an Arrondissement in the sense that it was formed in, in 1796 up until 1912, The exact time the commune as it is called today was formed is unknown, however the first census data from the commune dates back to 1821, so the commune is older than that. The parish of Oetrange was absorbed into the parish of Moutfort in 1946, shortly after in 1948, the parishes of Contern and Moutfort were effectively dissolved.

Early mentions in newspapers of Contern can be traced back to 1842, where it was mentioned in a long list of communes, although both the settlement and name have been seen far further back. Further mentions happened in 1844, following the death of John the Blind, signatures were collected from many communes, some came from Contern, it was document across multiple lists.

By 2001, the commune of Contern had a population of 3082, with the town itself having just 1065, the second largest in the commune. Also in 2001, Contern joined the Climate Alliance of European cities.

Although no prominent archaeological sites or artifacts date back to the Celtic times, plenty has been left over since the Romans including some housing and remnants of an aqueduct. The most prominent thing from the Romans however is the Gallo-Roman villa, it stood on the current site of the town and there are still remains of it to this day.

Following World War II, the Luxembourgers had strong distaste for their former German overseers. This was why almost every place in the country was renamed from its original Luxembourgish name of German origin, to that of French origin without changing too much. Contern's name would have stayed Conter if it weren't for the French pronunciation of "er" being far too strong, thus an "n" was added on the end. It could have been possible to have followed what places like Hesperange did, but in the end it stuck to the name Contern. In the modern era, to encourage more Luxembougish in the commune, many documents and signs use "Conter" instead of Contern.

Conter has long been a target of many pilgrimages. In Contern, the sacred Walburga was offered to heal "evil eyes" or to do something against the "evil gaze". The Luxembourgish dialect poet Jakob Diedenhoven describes the course of these pilgrimages in an ironic way in 1830 in his "prayer for Conter":

In 2020 the commune of Contern had a population of 3939, with a population density of around 188 people per square kilometer. The town itself had a population of 1743 which is far higher than what it had in the 2001 census of 1065.

Population of the entire commune 1821-2021
The E29 runs from Contern through Moutfort to Luxembourg City. Other smaller roads link Moutfort with the rest of the commune. Contern is served by many different bus routes. Many other towns within the commune are also served by these routes. CFL Line 30 provided train access to Contern. It runs through the commune with 2 stations in Sandweiler-Contern and Oetrange. There is also a freight railway which connects Oetrange with Berchem avoiding Luxembourg City.

Sourdough

Sourdough bread is made by the fermentation of dough using naturally occurring lactobacilli and yeast. It uses biological leavening rather than cultivated baker's yeast. The lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli gives it a more sour taste and improved keeping qualities.

In the "Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology", Michael Gaenzle writes: "The origins of bread-making are so ancient that everything said about them must be pure speculation. One of the oldest sourdough breads dates from 3700 BCE and was excavated in Switzerland, but the origin of sourdough fermentation likely relates to the origin of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent several thousand years earlier ... Bread production relied on the use of sourdough as a leavening agent for most of human history; the use of baker's yeast as a leavening agent dates back less than 150 years."

Pliny the Elder described the sourdough method in his "Natural History":
Sourdough remained the usual form of leavening down into the European Middle Ages. In modern times, barm from the beer brewing process replaced it, at first. Later, there was specially grown yeast.

Bread made from 100% rye flour is popular in the northern half of Europe. It is usually leavened with sourdough. Baker's yeast is not useful as a leavening agent for rye bread, because rye does not contain enough gluten. The structure of rye bread is based primarily on the starch in the flour, as well as other carbohydrates known as pentosans. however, rye amylase is active at much higher temperatures than wheat amylase, causing the structure of the bread to disintegrate as the starches are broken down during cooking. The lowered pH of a sourdough starter, therefore, inactivates the amylases when heat cannot, allowing the carbohydrates in the bread to gel and set properly. In the southern part of Europe, where panettone was originally made with sourdough, sourdough has become less common in recent times. It has been replaced by the faster-growing baker's yeast. Sometimes longer fermentation rests are used to allow for some bacterial activity to build flavor.

In English-speaking countries, wheat-based breads are more common. Sourdough is no longer the standard method for bread leavening. It was gradually replaced, first by the use of barm from beer making, then, after the confirmation of germ theory by Louis Pasteur, by cultured yeasts. Although sourdough bread was superseded in commercial bakeries in the 20th century, it has undergone a revival among artisan bakers.

Manufacturers of non-sourdough breads make up for the lack of yeast and bacterial culture by introducing into their dough an artificially-made mix known as bread improver or flour improver.

The preparation of sourdough begins with a pre-ferment (the "starter" or "leaven", also known as the "chief", "chef", "head", "mother" or "sponge"), a fermented mixture of flour and water, containing a colony of microorganisms including wild yeast and lactobacilli. The purpose of the starter is to produce a vigorous leaven and to develop the flavour of the bread. In practice there are several kinds of starters.

Flour already contains different kinds of yeast and bacteria spores. When flour comes in contact with water, the enzyme amylase breaks down the starch into different sugars. The yeast which is part of sourdough, can use these sugars. The mixture will develop into a stable bacteria culture, which will use fermentation. The yeast will produce carbon dioxide as a by-product of fermentation, which will leaven the dough.

Obtaining a satisfactory rise from sourdough takes longer than a dough leavened with baker's yeast because the yeast in a sourdough is less vigorous. In the presence of lactic acid bacteria, however, some sourdough yeasts have been observed to produce twice the gas of baker's yeast. The acidic conditions in sourdough, along with the bacteria also producing enzymes that break down proteins, result in weaker gluten and may produce a denser finished product.

As it ferments, sometimes for several days, the volume of the starter is increased by periodic additions of flour and water, called "refreshments". As long as this starter culture is fed flour and water regularly it will remain active.

The ratio of fermented starter to fresh flour and water is critical in the development and maintenance of a starter. This ratio is called the "refreshment ratio". Higher refreshment ratios are associated with greater microbial stability in the sourdough. In San Francisco sourdough, the ratio is 40% of the total weight, which is roughly equivalent to 67% of the new-dough's weight. A high refreshment ratio keeps acidity of the refreshed dough relatively low. Acidity levels of below pH 4.0 inhibit lactobacilli and favour acid-tolerant yeasts.

A starter prepared from scratch with a salted wheat-rye dough takes about 54 hours at to stabilise at a pH between 4.4 and 4.6. 4% salt inhibits "L. sanfranciscensis", while "C. milleri" can withstand 8%.

A drier and cooler starter has less bacterial activity and more yeast growth, which results in the bacterial production of more acetic acid relative to lactic acid. Conversely, a wetter and warmer starter has more bacterial activity and less yeast growth, with more lactic acid relative to acetic acid. The yeasts produce mainly CO and ethanol. High amounts of lactic acid are desired in rye and mixed-rye fermentations, while relatively higher amounts of acetic acid are desired in wheat fermentations. A dry, cool starter produces a sourer loaf than a wet, warm one. Firm starters (such as the Flemish Desem starter, which may be buried in a large container of flour to prevent drying out) tend to be more resource-intensive than wet ones.

A stable culture in which "L. sanfranciscensis" is the dominant bacterium requires a temperature between and refreshments every 24 hours for about two weeks. Refreshment intervals of longer than three days acidify the dough and may change the microbial ecosystem.

The intervals between refreshments of the starter may be reduced in order to increase the rate of gas (CO) production, a process described as "acceleration." In this process, the ratio of yeasts to lactobacilli may be altered. Generally, if once-daily refreshment-intervals have not been reduced to several hours, the percentage amount of starter in the final dough should be reduced to obtain a satisfactory rise during proof.

Faster starter processes, requiring fewer refreshments, have been devised, sometimes using commercial sourdough starters as inoculants. These starters generally fall into two types. One is made from traditionally maintained and stable starter doughs, often dried, in which the ratios of microorganisms are uncertain. Another is made from microorganisms carefully isolated from Petri dishes, grown into large, homogeneous populations in fermentors, and processed into combined baker's products with numerically defined ratios and known quantities of microorganisms well suited to particular bread styles.

The starter must be fed 4 to 12 hours prior to being added to dough, by mixing flour and water to the starter. This creates an active leaven, which should grow in size and is ready to use when it is bubbly and floats in water. The leaven is mixed with flour and water to make a final dough of the desired consistency. The starter weight is usually 13% to 25% of the total flour weight, though formulas may vary. The dough is shaped into loaves, left to rise, and then baked. A number of 'no knead' methods are available for sourdough bread. Due to the length of time sourdough bread takes to proof, many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to baking. This process is known as 'retardation' to slow down the proofing process. This process has the added benefit of developing a richer flavoured bread.

Because the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of breads made with baker's yeasts, sourdough starters are generally unsuitable for use in a bread machine. However, sourdough that has been proved over many hours, using a sourdough starter or mother dough, can then be transferred to the machine, utilizing only the baking segment of the bread-making program, bypassing timed mechanical kneading by the machine's paddle. This may be convenient for single loaf production, but the complex blistered and slashed crust characteristics of oven-baked sourdough bread cannot be achieved in a bread making machine, as this usually requires the use of a baking stone in the oven and misting of the dough to produce steam. Furthermore, ideal crust development requires loaves of shapes not achievable in a machine's loaf tin.

The museum has become a popular tourist attraction with thousands of visitors a year and has received international media attention, including a Canadian documentary movie called "The Final Member", which is about the museum's quest to obtain a human penis.

Ajuran Sultanate

The Ajuran Empire (, ), also spelled Ajuuraan Empire, and often simply as Ajuran, was a Somali empire in the medieval times that dominated the Indian ocean trade. They belonged to the Somali Muslim sultanate that ruled over large parts of the Horn of Africa in the Middle Ages. Because of their centralized administration and strong military, they were able to resist an attack by the Ottoman empire. This was called Gaal Madow. The fought a number of wars with the Portugese, and were able to withstand them. After the war, trade routes were re-established or strengthened. In the coastal provinces, trade flourished. Ships sailed to and came from many kingdoms and empires in East Asia, South Asia, Europe, the Near East, North Africa and East Africa.

The empire was very important, and built many castles and fortresses. Some of them can still be seen, mostly in the southern part of Somalia. There are also a number of pillar tombs, necropolises, and cities built during that era, which are now in ruins, which are attributed to Ajuran engineers. During the Ajuran period, many regions and people in the southern part of the Horn of Africa converted to Islam because of the theocratic nature of the government. The royal family, the House of Garen, expanded its territories and established its hegemonic rule through a skillful combination of warfare, trade linkages and alliances.

The Ajuran also controlled the water resources. They built wells and cisterns on the rivers Shebelle and Jubba. Many of these wells are still working. The rulers also developed a new system of agriculture and taxation, which were used in parts of the Horn of Africa until the 19th century. The later rulers of the Ajuran were not as successful: There were rebellions, and by the late 17th century the empire had fallen apart into a number of smaller states. The most prominent of these was probably the Geledi Sultanate.

No Longer at Ease

No Longer at Ease is a novel by Nigerian author Chinua Achebe. It is the story of an Igbo man, Obi Okonkwo, who leaves his village for an education in Britain and then a job in the Nigerian colonial civil service. He faces a conflict between his Western lifestyle and African culture and ends up taking a bribe.

The title of the novel comes from the poem The Journey of the Magi by T.S. Eliot.

We returned to our places, these Kingdoms,<br>
But no longer at ease here,<br>
With an alien people clutching their gods.<br>
I should be glad of another death.

Obi Okonko is the grandson of Okonkwo, the main character of Achebe's first novel, "Things Fall Apart". Obi is on trial for taking a bribe.

Some members of the Umuofia Progressive Union (UPU) collect money so that Obi can go to England to study law and help his people. However, he starts studying English instead of law. He meets Clara Okeke, who is studying to be a nurse, at a dance.

Obi returns to Nigeria. He now lives with a friend in Lagos and works for the government as part of the Scholarship Board, which is responsible for giving scholarships to students. A man offers a bribe on behalf of his sister, which Obi rejects. The girl herself visits Obi and tries to bribe him with sex for a scholarship, which he also rejects.

Obi is falling in love with Clara. However, he finds out that Clara is an "osu", or outcast in Igbo society. Because of her status, he cannot marry her. His father reluctantly refuses to let him marry her because he is a Christian and wants to leave the "heathen" ways of precolonial Igbo society. His mother begs him to not marry Clara until after she dies. When Obi tells Clara this, she calls off the engagement and reveals that she is pregnant. Obi arranges for her to get an abortion. He gets more into debt because he needs to repay the UPU, fund his siblings' educations, and pay for the abortion. 

Obi becomes depressed when he finds out that his mother died. He does not go to her funeral. When he recovers, he reluctantly begins to take bribes and accepts that bribery is the way of his world.

At the end of the novel, Obi takes a bribe, which he promises to himself would be the last one he would take. This turns out to be a sting operation and he is arrested.

"No Longer at Ease" takes place several decades after "Things Fall Apart". At this point, the British are in full control of Nigeria. Obi finds that he is in the middle of a conflict between the African expectation of financially supporting his family and village and living a Western lifestyle.

Obi Okonkwo is the grandson of Okonkwo from "Things Fall Apart". Both men speak their minds and are self-destructive. While Okonkwo is a man of action, Obi is a man who doesn't take much action because he uses thoughts and words more.

Third International Theory

The Third International Theory, also known as the Third Universal Theory (), was the style of government proposed by Muammar Gaddafi in the early 1970s, on which his government, the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, was officially based. It was inspired by Islamic socialism, Arab nationalism, African nationalism and the principles of direct democracy.

The Third International Theory was meant to be an alternative to capitalism and communism, which Gaddafi felt were not appropriate for the countries of the Third World (not allies with either the US or the Soviet Union).

In 2011, the Libyan government based on this political theory was overthrown and Gaddafi was killed.

In the 1960s and 70s, an ideology called Islamic socialism became popular in the Arab world. People believed that socialism should be combined with the principles of Islam so that there would be a more fair and just world. Many people believed that capitalism and communism were both disrespectful of Islam and allowed other countries to control them.

On September 1, 1969, a group of Libyan army officers overthrew the king and established a republic. This republic was ruled by a Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) that was led by a young colonel whose name was Muammar Gadaffi.

The revolution was against imperialism. On October 7, they told the UN that foreign bases would not be allowed on Libyan soil.

In 1973, the country was renamed Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. "Jamahiriya" is an Arabic word that means "People's Republic."

The beliefs of the Third International Theory are described in Gadaffi's "Green Book". The book is divided into three parts:


The first part of "The Green Book" is called "Solving the problem of democracy: The Authority of the People." The theory says that a country should not be holding a referendum, have a political party, or have a parliament. Gaddafi believed that these are not things a true democracy should have.
In the Jamahiriya, everyone is part of the People's Congresses, which then elect the People's Committees. The Committees then elect the next Congresses, which then elect the State Committees, which run the government. Once a year, the People's Congresses meet up at the General People's Congress, which makes decisions and where issues are discussed.

Gadaffi believed that everyone should have the right to speak their minds, no matter how irrational their beliefs are. He believed that having freedom of speech was important for democracy.

The second part of the book, "The solution of the economic problem (Socialism)," explains the economic parts of the Third International Theory.

"The Green Book" talks about women, specifically:

Gaddafi said that "human rights are for everyone—men and women, but the responsibilities are not equal."

Gadaffi believed that Black people would rule the world and that there is nothing anyone can do to prevent them from doing so. He says they will take over because they accept polygamy and reject birth control.

As time went on, Libya started to associate itself more with the rest of Africa than with the Arab world.


For this reason, stadiums were only open for military parades and wrestling was banned in Libya.

"The Green Book" does not talk about Islam. However, Gaddafi said that the validity of Islam was to be shown by how much it matches the Third International Theory. He said, "if we were to restrict ourselves to the support of Muslims only, that would be an example of bigotry and selfishness: True Islam is the one that defends the weak, even if they are not Muslims"

Gaddafi tried to put the Third International Theory into practice in Libya. He called the government based on the theory "Jamahiriya" (), which means "people's republic" or "state of the masses." It is different from "Jumhuriyah" (), which is the Arabic word for "republic." He wanted to show that the government system based on the Third International Theory was different from all previous forms of government (specifically monarchies and republics).

Certain episodes may also teach a variety of other subjects. These include computer programming and coding, basic science, and geography. The series is well-known for teaching topics such as these in a manner children enjoy.

Two agents, Olive and Otto, are members of the Odd Squad Precinct 13579. The episode begins with the agents helping somebody with an odd problem. The agents then go back to headquarters by traveling through tubes. After being in headquarters the agents are called up to Oprah (Miss O)'s office. Olive and Otto are then told to fix an odd problem. Usually, the problem is caused by a villain. Another Odd Squad agent or a citizen may also be the cause of a problem.

Villains weren't usually the cause of the problems, however an evil child character named "The Shadow" planned to team up a group of villains to take over the Odd Squad Mobile Unit.

There are 13 episodes in Season 3B. In the twentieth episode of Season 3, Opal left the Mobile Unit to join her sister because she was no longer evil. In the next episode, "Odd Off the Press," the Big O went to space to help the Odd Squad Space Unit and left the show after seven years. She sent the Little O to help the Mobile Unit. Opal was replaced by Agent Osmerelda, who was in many episodes as a normal child character. She did not join Odd Squad before this episode because she had too many other activities to do.

Sun and moon letters

In Arabic and Maltese, consonants are divided into two groups: the sun/solar letters ( ', Maltese: konsonanti xemxin) and moon/lunar letters ( ', Maltese: konsonanti qamrin).

In those languages, all nouns start with the word "al" (الـ) in Arabic or "il" in Maltese. Both words mean "the." If a sun letter comes after the consonant, the "l" sound in "al" or "il" is dropped and is replaced by whatever sound the letter makes. However, if a moon letter comes after, the "l" sound in those words stays.

In Arabic, the word for "the sun" is "ash-shams" because the "sh" sound is a sun letter. Meanwhile, the word for "the moon" is "al-qamar" because the "q" sound is a moon letter.

Below is a chart of the sun and moon letters in Arabic.
The ال "'al-"' is written down in Arabic regardless of how it is pronounced. In the case of sun letters, a mark called the "shaddah" (ـّـ) is written over the sun letter. For moon letters, a mark called the "sukun" (ـْـ)is written over the letter ل "lam" in the "al-."
Below is a chart of the sun and moon letters in Maltese.

If a word starts with any of the moon letters, the word il- stays the same. However, if it stats with a sun letter, the word il-changes to iċ-, id-, in-, ir-, is-, it-, ix-, iż-, iz-.

If a word begins with two consonants, it changes to "l-i-." For example, "skola" (school) becomes "l-iskola" (the school).

Helen Betty Osborne

Helen Betty Osborne, or Betty Osborne (July 16, 1952 – November 13, 1971), was a Cree woman who was kidnapped and murdered while walking down the street in The Pas, Manitoba.

Osborne was born on the reserve of Norway House, Manitoba, to Joe and Justine (née McKay) Osborne. She wanted to become a teacher. There was no secondary school in Norway House so she had to leave home for further education. She spent two years at Guy Hill Residential School, just outside The Pas, Manitoba, a town of European Canadians, Métis, and Cree people. In the fall of 1971, Osborne attended Margaret Barbour Collegiate in The Pas. Back then in Canada, a collegiate institute was a high school for students who wanted to go to university. She stayed with the Bensons, a non-aboriginal family.

On the evening of her death, Osborne had spent time with friends at The Northern Lite Cafe and then at the Bensons' place before heading back downtown. Around midnight, Osborne's friends returned home; not much is known about where Osborne was or what she was doing after that. She was walking home at approximately 2:30 a.m. when she was abducted, beaten, and stabbed with a screwdriver over 50 times. The following day, a boy named Kenny Gurba discovered her naked body. He and his father called the police.

Police at first suspected her ex-boyfriend, Cornelius Bighetty. His name was cleared after successfully passing a lie detector test. She and Cornelius had an argument earlier in the evening at the Cambrian Hotel. At first, attention was placed on Betty's friends. Unfortunately, poor recording and preserving of evidence at the Pump House (the crime scene) seriously affected the investigation.

Dwayne Archie Johnston, James Robert Paul Houghton, Lee Scott Colgan and Norman Bernard Manger, four young white men from The Pas, were accused of killing her. However, it was not until December 1987, sixteen years after her death, that any of them were convicted of the crime. It was at this time that Constable Rob Urbanowski took over the investigation and placed an ad in the local newspaper asking for witnesses to come forward. Even then, only Johnston was convicted, as Houghton had been acquitted, Colgan had received immunity for testifying against Houghton and Johnston, and Manger was never charged.

The Aboriginal Justice Implementation Commission did an investigation into concerns about how long it took to solve her case. According to the Commission report, Osborne's autopsy showed that "along with well over 50 stab wounds, her skull, cheekbones and palate were broken, her lungs were damaged, and one kidney was torn. Her body showed extensive bruising." The Commission concluded that the most significant factors prolonging the case were racism, sexism and indifference of white people.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police officially closed the Osborne case on February 12, 1999.

A formal apology from the Manitoba government was given by Gord Mackintosh, Manitoba's Minister of Justice, on July 14, 2000. The apology addressed the failure of the province's justice system in Osborne's case. The province also created a scholarship in Osborne's name for Aboriginal women.

The Pas, Manitoba, is still affected by this event. Recently, there has been a movement by the Aboriginal community to build healthier communities and this is having a positive impact on the town and surrounding community.

To remember Helen Betty Osborne, the town of Norway House named a school after her. The University of Winnipeg's Wii Chiiwaakanak Learning Centre is located in a building named after Osborne.

On March 26, 2008, the Osborne family again grieved as her brother was found slain in his apartment in downtown Winnipeg. It was Winnipeg's sixth homicide of 2008.

On December 2, 2008, a graphic novel entitled 'The Life of Helen Betty Osborne' was published by The Helen Betty Osborne Memorial Foundation. The purpose of the graphic novel was to educate youth about racism, sexism, and indifference.

Canadian Indie-Folk Rock band The Wooden Sky has produced a four-song EP entitled "The Lonesome Death of Helen Betty Osborne" and has also released a song with the same title on their full-length album "When Lost At Sea" in recognition of Osborne. Lyrics to the song discuss the night of Osborne's murder.

Robert Munsch, a Canadian children's author, discussed his experience of being walked to the grave of Helen Betty Osborne one year before her perpetrators were captured. He discussed how this single incident led to a complete evolution not only in his writing as a children's author, but also in his philosophy of life.

The Osborne case is a considered an influence on Tomson Highway's "The Rez Sisters" (1986). The character Zhaboonigan Peterson, a mentally challenged young woman, performs a monologue in which she describes being raped by two white men with a screwdriver (Osborne was stabbed 56 times with a screwdriver). Highway attended junior high school in The Pas and graduated a year before Osborne's rape and murder.

In 1991, a CBC TV miniseries about the Osborne kidnapping and murder was made, entitled "Conspiracy of Silence".

This frog has short, broken lines on its lower eyelids. This frog has pupils in its eyes that go up and down and open side to side. It can be many different colors.

At the festival, with the men decked in flowers, and the women wearing normally forbidden gay costumes, five days of farces and mimes were enacted – ithyphallic, and including nudity when called for – followed by a sixth day of the hunting of goats and hares. On May 23 another (rose) festival was held in her honor.

Flora's Greek equivalent is Chloris, who was a nymph. Flora is married to Favonius, the wind god also known as Zephyr, and her companion was Hercules.

Flora achieved more prominence in the neo-pagan revival of Antiquity among Renaissance humanists than she had ever enjoyed in ancient Rome.

Wasting Light

Wasting Light is the seventh studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters. It was released on April 12, 2011 on Roswell and RCA Records. It was the first Foo Fighters album with guitarist Pat Smear playing on it since "The Colour and the Shape" (1997) as a member. He did play on "Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace" (2007) as a guest.

When making the album, the band did not want to use digital recording as they wanted to sound how they did in their first albums. The album was made in the garage of Dave Grohl, the lead singer and guitarist of the band. The house was in Encino, California. The album was made on only analog equipment. It was produced by Butch Vig. Vig had worked with Grohl in 1991 and 1992 to produce Nirvana's album "Nevermind". The band spent three weeks making sure they could play the songs well before recording, as no mistakes can be fixed after recording on analog equipment. There were also guests who played on the album, such as Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, Jessy Greene, Rami Jaffee and Fee Waybill.

Six singles were released from the album. The most successful was Rope, which went straight to number one on "Billboard"'s Rock Songs chart. It was only the second ever single to go straight to number one on this chart. "Wasting Light" went straight to number one on the albums charts of twelve countries. Critics said mainly good things about the album, mainly about the production and songwriting. In 2012, "Wasting Light" won four Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album.

After the "Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace" concert tour ended in 2008, the Foo Fighters went to Grandmaster Recorders in Hollywood, California to record 14 songs. They wanted to release these quickly, without advertising or promoting them. They then changed their mind and took a break instead. Three of these songs were released: "Wheels", "Word Forward", and "Rope". The first two were released as part of the "Greatest Hits" album and "Rope" was released on "Wasting Light". "Wheels" and "Word Forward" were produced by Butch Vig, which is what made Dave Grohl decide to work with him to make a new album. Grohl had worked with Vig when he was in Nirvana to make the album "Nevermind".

Dave Grohl had the idea of making a new album in 2010, while he was touring in Australia with Them Crooked Vultures. He wanted to make a documentary of making the album. He also didn't want to make it in an expensive studio with new equipment, but instead wanted to use the same equipment used in the 1990s. He later also said he didn't want it to be the best album they had made, but he wanted it to be the one people would know them for best. He said it would be a lot like "Back in Black" for Amy Winehouse or "The Black Album" for Metallica. The album was also the first to have guitarist Pat Smear. Smear had left the band after the album "The Colour and the Shape" in 1997.

"Wasting Light" was recorded in Dave Grohl's garage at his home in Encino, California. The Foo Fighters' other albums were recorded Studio 606, which was built by the band. Grohl said that he "wanted to make records the way we used to fucking make records", instead of making them in a new studio with new equipment.

The album was made using only analog equipment. Digital equipment was only used after the album was made. Grohl did this as he thought digital recording was "getting out of control". He also said that when he heard new music, all he could hear was drum machines. He didn't like the idea of not using real musical instruments.

When producer Butch Vig heard that the band wanted to use analog equipment, he thought they were joking. Vig then said that the band would have to play very well. This is because mistakes on analog tape cannot be fixed. The band then practiced for three weeks in Studio 606 and chose the songs to use on the album. They started with 40 songs that they had and chose fourteen.

Grohl's garage had microphones and sound baffles on the garage door and behind the drums. There was also a carpet under the drums. This stopped sound from leaking outside of the garage. The small room next to the study was used as a room to record vocals. A tent was set up in the back yard for the control room. There were two cameras set up in the garage that linked to a television in the tent so that the band could talk to the producer in the tent. The same equipment that was used to make "There Is Nothing Left to Lose" and "One by One" in Grohl's house in Alexandria, Virginia were used to make "Wasting Light".

Incubation

Incubation or brooding, is when oviparous (egg-laying) animals sit on their eggs to hatch them. It also refers to the development of the embryo in the egg under good environmental conditions. 

Since birds are warm-blooded, they sit on the eggs to keep them warm. Reptiles and invertebrates are cold-blooded, and so need to keep their eggs in warm places. Sometimes even birds need the help of the Sun.

Many factors may be vital to the incubation. In some reptiles for example, no fixed temperature is necessary. However, the actual temperature determines the sex ratio of the offspring. In birds, by contrast, the sex of offspring is genetically determined, but a constant and particular temperature may be necessary for successful incubation.

In poultry, the act of sitting on eggs to incubate them is called 'brooding'. The action or tendency to sit on a clutch of eggs is also called "broodiness".

Despite this, he strived to match his formidable uncle's reputation by abandoning the payment of tributes to the Empire's neighbors. This miscalculated move resulted in rekindling of war with the Sassanid Empire, and in a Lombard invasion which cost the Romans much of their territory in Italy.

Angry white male

"Angry white male" is an insult for white men holding conservative or right-wing views. The term is often used when talking about the politics of the United States.

The term mostly refers to a group which emerged in the early 1990s. They reacted to what they thought were injustices by the "affirmative action" quotas in the workplace. Such people are not necessarily Nazis or extremists.

An angry white male is supposed to be opposed to anti-discrimination policies (such as affirmative action) that benefit racial minorities and women. Supporters of Donald Trump are sometimes said to be angry white men.

The term "angry white male" is also used in Australia to talk about men who do not like feminism.

Class traitor

A class traitor is someone who is thought to be working against the interests of the particular social class. The term is mostly used by socialists to describe members of the proletariat class who work for the bourgeoisie. Some examples of those who are seen as class traitors are: soldiers, police officers, strikebreakers, and those who help keep things the way things are right now, instead of working for change. Some people think that anyone, including the bourgeois, can become class traitors.

The motives behind becoming a traitor to one's class can include: survival (taking up whatever wage is available), the belief that the person is of a higher class and so has political views that work against the working class, the pressure to follow rules and laws, or disagreeing with the view that society is divided up into classes that are fighting each other.

Karl Kautsky, a Marxist philosopher, first used the term. 

"Class traitor" can also be used to describe members of the upper class who believe in socialism.

Such people sacrifice their ability to be part of the upper-class for the sake of who they see as the oppressed, even if it hurts their status in the process.

Since the George Floyd protests, the term has been used more to criticize the media.

Many TV shows are seen as examples of copaganda.

John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan

Richard John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan (born 18 December 1934 – disappeared 8 November 1974, declared dead 3 February 2016), commonly known as Lord Lucan, was a British peer. He disappeared after being suspected of murder.

He was an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, the eldest son of George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan by his mother Kaitlin Dawson. He was born in London.

He was a known gambler and became skilled at backgammon and bridge, and was an early member of the Clermont Club. Lucan's losses often were more than his winnings, yet he left his job at a London-based merchant bank and became a professional gambler. He was known as Lord Bingham from April 1949 until January 1964, during his father's lifetime.

Lucan was thought for the role of James Bond in the movie versions of Ian Fleming's novels. He was known for his expensive tastes

On the evening of 7 November 1974, Sandra Rivett, the nanny of Lucan's children, was beaten to death in the basement of the Lucan family home. Lady Lucan was also attacked; she later said Lucan as her assailant. As the police began their homicide investigation, Lucan telephoned his mother, asking her to collect the children, and then drove a borrowed Ford Corsair to a friend's house in Uckfield, East Sussex. Hours later, he left the property and disappeared.

The car was found abandoned in Newhaven. The police issued a warrant for Lucan's arrest a few days later, and the inquest into Rivett's death named him as her murderer.

Many believed he faked his death so avoid being arrested while some believe he committed suicide or was murdered. Lucan has not been found and was presumed dead in chambers on 11 December 1992 and declared legally dead in October 1999.

Bart on the Road

"Bart on the Road" is the 20th episode of the 7th season of "The Simpsons". It was first shown on television on March 31, 1996. In the episode, Bart gets a fake driver's license and takes his friends to Knoxville, Tennessee. However, Bart's car gets destroyed and Homer must use a courier to get Bart and his friends back to Springfield. 

The episode makes references to the movie "Naked Lunch", singer Andy Williams, and the "Look" magazine.

Principal Skinner closes the Springfield Elementary School and tells his students to go to work with your parents. Bart wants to stay at home with Marge, but he is told that housecleaning is not a real job. Instead, Bart goes to Patty and Selma's job at the DMV (department of motor vehicles). Lisa goes to Homer's job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Bart makes a fake driver's license at the DMV and rents a car with Nelson, Milhouse, and Martin.

Bart and his friends tell their parents that they are going to Canada for a grammar competition. They instead use the rented car for a road trip to the 1982 World's Fair at Knoxville, Tennessee. However, the world fair happened 14 years ago and only a wig shop is still there. They all buy wigs and Martin uses the last money they have on a doll of Al Gore. Nelson knocks down the Sunsphere, which destroys their car. They are left being stuck in Knoxville.

Lisa uses her time during spring break at the power plant. Bart places a collect call on Lisa to help him and his friends return home without having Homer and Marge know. Bart becomes a courier but does not get enough money to go home. Principal Skinner sees Bart in Hong Kong while being a courier. Lisa makes Homer promise that he will not get angry about Bart, so she tells Homer where Bart is. Homer orders a new console for the power plant from Oak Ridge so Bart can get home. He gets it shipped near Knoxville, where Bart is still a courier. Nelson, Milhouse, and Martin hide in a crate.

Marge does not know about any of this and gets confused when she gets phone calls on what Bart has done.

John Thorpe of "Central Michigan Life" called it the 8th best episode of "The Simpsons". Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of B+ and thought that the best part of the episode was Patty and Selma telling Bart about their job, saying "Somedays we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays." Robert Canning of IGN calls the episode "outstanding" and says that "it's the way everything comes together that really makes it memorable." Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said that he loved the children at their parents' jobs and said "when they head out of town, the fun continues."

1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal

The 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal is a political scandal that is taking place in Malaysia. In 2015, Prime Minister Najib Razak was accused of sending over Malaysian ringgit (about US$) from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a government-run company that was made to develop the country's economy, to his own bank accounts. Many Malaysians called for Najib to resign because they did not want a corrupt prime minister. In 2018, Najib was defeated in an election by Mahathir Mohamad.

A Malaysian politician, Anwar Ibrahim, has asked questions about the true purpose of 1MDB. He told Parliament that the company "has no business address and no appointed auditor" to check the company's finances. According to records, 1MDB has nearly RM 42 billion (US$11.73 billion) in debt.

"Berhad" is a Malay word that means limited. In this case it means a limited company. That means that a company's finances are separate from those of the owners. Members of the public may not own shares in the company.

Unistʼotʼen Camp

The Unistʼotʼen Camp (pronounced OO-nis-TAH-den) is a camp built on the territory of the Unist'otʼen clan of the Wetʼsuwetʼen Nation. It is in northern British Columbia, Canada. It is located at the point where several planned energy pipelines will pass, as a means to block the crossing of Wetʼsuwetʼen territory by pipeline-related industries. It is at the point where several planned energy pipelines will pass.

The camp is by road from Vancouver, BC and about from the town of Smithers, BC.

The Wetʼsuwetʼen have built a checkpoint some east of the camp on the Morice River Forest Services Road. At this point, visitors must have permission to enter the territory. They have banned construction workers and equipment from coming in. In 2019, the Coastal GasLink Pipeline went to court to enforce the permission granted by the Wetʼsuwetʼen and other First Nations band councils to build in the area. A court decision in 2020 gave an injunction against the Unisʼtotʼen clan and its supporters. In February 2020, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) took down the blockades and checkpoints. After the RCMP's actions, there have been protests across Canada supporting the Wetʼsuwetʼen.

The Wet’suwet’en are divided into five clans. Each clan is led by a hereditary chief. Hereditary means that he or she got the position from a parent who was also a hereditary chief. These chiefs were part of a precolonial government system and are responsible for taking care of the land.

The Wet’suwet’en also have an elected council, which was created after the arrival of Europeans in Canada. These councils were created through the Indian Act and are a way for the Wet’suwet’en to meet with the Canadian government. There is a lot of confusion on whether the chiefs or the council represent the Wet’suwet’en people.

The council approved for a pipeline to be built on Wet'suwet'en territory. However, the hereditary chiefs did not agree. The chiefs set up the camp in 2010. The area of the camp is where the pipelines are supposed to cross Talbits Kwah (Gosnell Creek). At the camp, there is a pit house, a garden, several greenhouses, a healing center, and a bunkhouse.

In 2015, the Unistʼotʼen released a declaration which included this statement:"The Unistʼotʼen settlement camp is not a protest or a demonstration. Our clan is occupying and using our traditional territory as it has for centuries. Our free, prior, and informed consent protocol is in place at the entrance of our territory as an expression of our jurisdiction and our inherent right to both give and refuse consent and entry into our territory."

This quote meant that the clan can refuse to let people in because they have authority over the land as the traditional caretakers.

Healing and learning activities take place at the camp. A healing center was built in 2015. The healing center welcomes people to reconnect with the land, learn cultural practices, and recover from health issues such as substance abuse using traditional Indigenous methods. According to the traditional beliefs of the Wetʼsuwetʼen people, healing can come from being connected to the land and that the impacts of colonialism, including living away from traditional territories, are harmful. A youth camp provides opportunities for young people to learn and practice their culture.

The Wetʼsuwetʼen set up a checkpoint on the Morice River Forest Services Road several kilometers from the camp, controlling access to the area. The area was blocked to the pipeline project.

In 2018, TC Energy was granted an injunction to remove the checkpoint so they can have complete access to the pipeline project construction. In January 2019, the RCMP entered the territory to enforce the court injunction and allow workers from the Coastal GasLink pipeline project access to the area. The RCMP arrested 14 people on January 8 at the checkpoint. The pipeline workers completed their pre-construction work. Afterwards, the blockades were rebuilt.

People who support of the blockade consider the action taken at the Unisʼtotʼen checkpoint and the lack of consultation with hereditary chiefs to be violations of the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Many Indigenous peoples have written and discussed the ways this action will impact the Canadian government's efforts to put in practice the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report, with many famous Indigenous peoples such as broadcaster Jesse Wente, speaking at rallies and protests.

In December 2019, the injunction was put in place again. More discussions ended without the pipeline proponents convincing the hereditary chiefs and their supporters to withdraw. The RCMP returned to the area in 2020 and arrests began again as the RCMP cleared the Morice Forest Service Road. Supporters of the blockade remained along the road, including the camp. The arrests sparked protests in BC and across Canada in support of the Wet'suwet'en.

Statements showing supporting the Unistʼotʼen Camp have been issued by organizations and institutions such as: OCAD University, the British Columbia Teachers' Federation, Ryerson University School of Social Work.

Welcome to Sky Valley

Welcome to Sky Valley, also known as just Sky Valley, is the third studio album by American rock band Kyuss. It was released on 28 June 1994 on Elektra and Chameleon Records.

"Welcome to Sky Valley" was recorded in early 1993 and was first meant to be released in January 1994. Because their last album did fairly well, they moved to the main record label Chameleon from the smaller label "Dali". In November 1993, Chameleon suddenly shut down. Elektra then quickly signed the banned and planned to release Welcome to Sky Valley in March 1994. The release was then slowed down even more and the album wasn't released until June 1994.

The album has been called stoner rock, stoner metal, and desert rock. The album was the first Kyuss album to have bassist Scott Reeder playing on it. He replaced Nick Oliveri in 1992. It was also the last with Brant Bjork playing on it.

"Welcome to Sky Valley" is named after the place in California of the same name. The album cover shows a welcome sign in Sky Valley next to a road that says the album's name, "Welcome to Sky Valley". The photograph was taken at dusk and the road is dark with a purple sky behind.

The members of The Drasticles are two fish named Grand Maul Granny and Not Dead Ted and a krill named Johnny Krill. A British fish tells SpongeBob and Patrick that they are part of an extreme sports team. Patrick thinks that the fish said "extreme spots" because of the fish's lisp, so he stings himself with a jellyfish to get "extreme spots". Johnny Krill tells SpongeBob to get on a motorbike to see if SpongeBob can play extreme sports. Patrick sandboards down a mountain with Grand Maul Granny. Both SpongeBob and Patrick are not able to keep up with the sports and are told that the sports are too extreme for them.

V. S. Ramachandran

Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran, also called V.S. Ramachandran (born 10 August 1951) is an Indian scientist and educator. He has written more than 180 scientific research papers. He co-discovered the mirror neuron, is a nerve cell that helps human beings understand other human beings' actions. Richard Dawkins called him "the Marco Polo of Neuroscience." "Time" magazine called him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.

Ramachandran is the director of the Center for Brain and Cognition at the University of California, San Diego, distinguished professor in the Psychology Department and Neurosciences Program at the University of California, San Diego, and adjunct professor of biology at the Salk Institute. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.

Ramachandran was born in Tamil Nadu, in India. His father was a diplomat. His grandfather, Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, helped write India's constitution. When Ramachandran was a child, he collected shells and fossils. He sent his fossils to the American Museum of Natural History. When he was an adult, the dinosaur "Minotaurasaurus ramachandrani" was named after him.

At first, Ramachandran learned to be a medical doctor (MBBS) at Stanley medical Collage in Madras in India. He became a research scientist later. He earned a Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge's Trinity College.

Ramachandran helped discover the mirror neuron, a type of brain cell that does not work the same way in autistic people. He also figured out how to help people with phantom pain. A person who is missing part of their body, for example a hand, may feel as if the hand is still there. They may feel hot or cold or as if their hand is closed too tight. This is called a phantom limb. They may feel pain in their hand, even though it is not there. Really, it is the brain's sensory cortex making this pain. Ramachandran figured out how to use mirrors to trick the person's brain into thinking that the limb was there and healthy, so it would stop hurting.

V.S. Ramachandran wrote many books. The BBC made one book, "Phantoms in the Brain", into a mini-series.

Ramachandran also studies evolution, dinosaurs, plate tectonics, Indian art, and medicine in the 1800s.

The government of India named Ramachandran Padma Bhushan in the 2000s. This is India's third-highest honor.

Ramachandran married Diane Rogers-Ramachandran in 1987. She is an experimental psychologist, and she and Ramachandran have performed experiments together. They have two sons, Chandramani and Jaya.

Traditional pop

Traditional pop, also called standard music, is a genre (or type) of Western popular music that was popular before the beginning of rock and roll in the middle of 1950s. The most popular and ever-lasting songs during this period of music are also known as pop standards or American standards.

The works of these songwriters are usually considered part of the great pieces known as the "Great American Songbook". In general, the word "standard" means any popular song that has become very widely known within our basic culture.

"Traditional pop" is now also currently used for standard music, as one category of popular music in Grammy Awards. AllMusic defines traditional pop as "post-big band and pre-rock & roll pop music."

On the Broadway, Tin Pan Alley, and Hollywood show in the 1930s and 1940s, a number of popular songs were written by many songwriters - such as: Irving Berlin, Frederick Loewe, Victor Herbert, Harry Warren, Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern, George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, Oscar Hammerstein, Johnny Mercer, Dorothy Fields, Hoagy Carmichael and Cole Porter.

Good improvements were added then. These are string sections or orchestral parts and put more importance on the vocal presentation before the listenners. In this way, rich sounds of strings can be heard in much of the popular music throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Songs made by these writers became popular among people in America. Some of these are now forgotten, but others called standards by people at present time.

In 1960s, rock and roll appeared in music scene and became more popular than such standard music. But some singers like Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Tony Bennett and others still remained popular on television and radio. 

Harry Nilsson recorded an album "A Little Touch of Schmilsson In the Night" in 1973 with orchestra by Gordon Jenkins. In 1980s, Linda Ronstadt, a popular female singer sang and recorded albums of standard songs. She performed with Nelson Riddle orchestra. Recordings by Rod Stewart's It Had to Be You: The Great American Songbook, Willie Nelson's Stardust and Carly Simon's Torch were made public. These were great successes on the music scene.

While it is called a tea, ginseng tea does not contain tea leaves. It is a herbal tea infusion made out of the ginseng plant's root.

Oolong

Oolong (; ("wūlóng", "black dragon") is a traditional semi-oxidized Chinese tea ("Camellia sinensis)" produced through a process including withering the plant under strong sun. 

Oolong is especially popular in south China.

The creation of oolong tea involves repeating stages to achieve the desired amount of bruising and browning of leaves. Withering, rolling, shaping, and firing are similar to black tea.

Herbal tea

Herbal teas—less commonly called tisanes (UK and US , US also )—are beverages made from the infusion or decoction of herbs, spices, or other plant material in hot water. 

The term "herbal tea" is often used to show the difference between true teas (e.g., black, green, white, yellow, oolong) which are made from "Camellia sinensis". 

Yellow tea

Yellow tea can refer to Chinese huángchá () and Korean hwangcha (). is an increasingly rare and expensive variety of tea. The process for making yellow tea is similar to that of green but with an added step of encasing and steaming the tea.

Le Chaudron infernal

Le Chaudron infernal is a French silent trick movie made in 1903. It was directed by Georges Méliès. In Britain it was released as The Infernal Cauldron and in the United States as The Infernal Caldron and the Phantasmal Vapors. It was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 499–500 in its catalogues.

In a Renaissance chamber decorated with devilish faces and a warped coat of arms, a gleeful Satan throws three human victims into a cauldron, which spews out flames. The victims rise from the cauldron as nebulous ghosts, and then turn into fireballs. The fireballs multiply and pursue Satan around the chamber. Finally Satan himself leaps into the infernal cauldron, which gives off a final burst of flame.

The movies Meliès did before 1903 were often pirated by American producers. This is especially true for his popular movie "A Trip to the Moon". To fight against this product piracy, Méliès opened an American branch of his Star Film Company. He began producing two negatives of each movie he made: one for home markets, and one for foreign release. To produce the two separate negatives, Méliès built a special camera that used two lenses and two reels of film.

In the 2000s, researchers at the French film company Lobster Films noticed that Méliès's two-lens system was a fully functional, stereo film camera. 3D versions of Meliè' movies could e made by combining the domestic and foreign prints of the film. Serge Bromberg, the founder of Lobster Films, presented 3D versions of "The Infernal Cauldron" and another 1903 Méliès film, "The Oracle of Delphi", at a January 2010 presentation at the Cinémathèque Française. According to the film critic Kristin Thompson, "the effect of 3D was delightful … the films as synchronized by Lobster looked exactly as if Méliès had designed them for 3D." Bromberg screened both films again—as well as the 1906 Méliès film "The Mysterious Retort", similarly prepared for 3D—at a September 2011 presentation at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

2020 Atlantic hurricane season

The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active Atlantic hurricane season ever recorded, breaking the record of 2005. The season had a record-breaking 12 storms that hit the U.S., with many making landfall in Louisiana. The season had had thirty-one tropical or subtropical cyclones, thirty named storms, fourteen hurricanes, and seven major hurricanes. It had over twenty tropical storms that broke formation date records. The season happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, making it harder to evacuate and give help to people who needed it.

The season had 30 named storms and one that wasn't named because it wasn't strong enough.

Tropical Storm Arthur was an early storm. It formed on May 16 from a stormy area near Cuba, and caused damage in Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina, as well as The Bahamas and Bermuda. Even though the storm was kind of strong, it only lasted three days.

Tropical Storm Bertha was an early storm as well. While it only lasted one day, it caused some damage in The Bahamas and Southern United States. It also led to the Crew Dragon Demo-2 flight being delayed.

Tropical Storm Cristobal was the earliest third named storm on record. The storm had formed from clouds left-over by Tropical Storm Amanda. The storm formed in the Bay of Campeche, devastated Mexico, and stalled, before hitting Louisiana. The storm then traveled up to Wisconsin, as a weaker tropical depression, before becoming post-tropical.

Tropical Storm Dolly was a short-lived storm. It formed on June 22 as a subtropical system, becoming tropical on June 23, as it reached tropical storm status, and dissipated on June 24.

Tropical Storm Edouard formed in an unusual time of the year, in July. It formed on July 4, and reached tropical storm status on July 6. After reaching tropical storm status, it became the earliest fifth named storm until Hurricane Elsa formed on July 1, 2021.
Earliest sixth named storm. Tropical Storm Fay formed off the coast of the Carolinas and then struck New Jersey as a tropical storm, weakening inland.
Earliest seventh named storm. Nearly made a landfall in Guyana.
In July 23, Hanna formed in the Gulf of Mexico, from a tropical wave. On July 24, it reached tropical storm status, becoming the earliest named eighth storm. The storm rapidly strengthened, becoming a hurricane on July 25. It then before hitting Texas later that day. The damage was bad, as a pandemic was growing at that time.

Isaias was a bad storm. It hit the Bahamas, before moving up the east coast of the United States, making landfall in North Carolina. Before the storm formed, it was broad and disorganized, but upon being named on July 30, Isaias became the earliest ninth named storm ever recorded. It then moved up into the Dominican Republic, and then into the Bahamas. It then traveled off the coast of the United States, and hit North Carolina. Isaias caused over $4.2 billion worth of damage.

Tropical depression Ten formed on July 31, but failed to strengthen due to harsh conditions. The storm moved slowly, and dissipated on August 2. Some tropical storm force winds were found in the center of the system by the National Hurricane Center, but they said it was bloated.

Earliest tenth named storm.
Earliest eleventh named storm, breaking the record of Hurricane Katrina.
On August 20, a tropical wave organized into a tropical depression. The next day, the depression, which was originally disorganized, strengthened into Tropical Storm Laura. Upon reaching tropical storm status, it became the earliest twelfth tropical storm in the Atlantic. The system then passed over the Leeward Islands, passing south of Puerto Rico. The system made landfall on the Dominican Republic, but the system had not lost any strength, despite the mountainous terrain. The system then made landfall in Cuba twice, before becoming a hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico on August 24. The storm underwent rapid intensification, becoming a category 2 hurricane on August 25. Laura became a major hurricane (Category 3) 9 hours later. The storm then became a Category 4 six hours later. Its highest winds were 150 mph. The storm hit Louisiana around that time. After going over Louisiana, the system quickly weakened, and lost its life over Kentucky.

In Louisiana, buildings were damaged very badly by the storm. The highest winds were reported at 95 miles per hour in Lake Charles, along with a gust of 137 miles per hour also in Lake Charles. Damage was the worst in Lake Charles, where almost every house had a tarp on it to keep out rain after their roofs had been destroyed. Luckily, even though a push of water was supposed to be more than 15 feet in places, at last minute, it moved to the west, pushing all the water into places with fewer people.
Earliest thirteenth named storm.

Earliest fifteenth named storm. Very unusual track.
Earliest fourteenth named storm. Formed after Omar, but strengthened into a tropical storm before Omar.
Earliest sixteenth named storm. It then made a very rare landfall in Bermuda, and then dissipated. After it dissipated, it became a tropical storm again. Because of this, people called it a "zombie storm," because it came back after dissipating.
Earliest seventeenth named storm.

Earliest eighteenth named storm. Sally hit Alabama as a Category 2 with a peak intensity of 110 mph.

Earliest nineteenth named storm. This storm formed and eventually became a category 4, before weakening and hitting Newfoundland with winds 65 mph.

Earliest twentieth named storm.

Earliest twenty-third named storm.

Earliest twenty-first named storm.

Earliest twenty-second named storm. Made an extremely rare landfall in mainland Europe. Made 2020 only the second season to use the Greek Alphabet.

Earliest twenty-fourth named storm.
Earliest twenty-fifth named storm. Made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 2, causing catastrophic damage.

Earliest twenty-sixth named storm. Fourth major hurricane of the season.
Earliest twenty-seventh named storm. Caused damage in the Southeast United States. Brought snow to New England.
Earliest twenty-eight named storm. Became a powerful Category 4 hurricane. Struck Central America, Cuba, and Florida.
On November 10, Subtropical Storm Theta formed, making the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season the busiest Atlantic hurricane season on record. The next day, the storm transitioned into a tropical storm, as it peaked with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). The storm then weakened, but restrengthened to reach 65 mph (105 km/h), before weakening, and eventually dissipating on July 15.

Hurricane Iota was a deadly and damaging storm that hit Central America on November 17. Forming in the Caribbean Sea, the storm strengthened a lot rapidly, becoming one of the latest Category 4 storms to form, reaching Category 4 status on November 16.

This is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a tropical wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in USD. Potential tropical cyclones are not included in this table.


Majorana fermion

A Majorana fermion(), also referred to as a Majorana particle, is a fermion that has the same properties as its antiparticle. Ettore Majorana, an Italian physicist, thought they would exist, in 1937. Majorana disappeared in 1938, and the particles are named after him. As Majorana fermionns are thought to have the same properties as their antiparticles, they cannot have an electric charge. Today, atomic particles with an electric charge are called Dirac fermions. An example for Dirac fermions are electrons, and positrons; they have the same properties, but their electric charge is different. 

Neutrinos do not have an electric charge, and might be Majorana fermions, but their status is unclear

The concept goes back to Majorana's suggestion of 1937. Majorana suggested that neutral spin- particles can be described by a real wave equation (the Majorana equation). The wave functions of particle and antiparticle are related by complex conjugation. For this reason, they would be identical to their antiparticle.

The difference between Majorana fermions and Dirac fermions can be expressed mathematically in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of second quantization: The creation operator formula_1 creates a fermion in quantum state formula_2 (described by a "real" wave function), whereas the annihilation operator formula_3 annihilates it (or, equivalently, creates the corresponding antiparticle). For a Dirac fermion the operators formula_1 and formula_3 are distinct, whereas for a Majorana fermion they are identical. The ordinary fermionic annihilation and creation operators formula_6 and formula_7 can be written in terms of two Majorana operators formula_8 and formula_9 by

In supersymmetry models, neutralinos—superpartners of gauge bosons and Higgs bosons—are Majorana.

The standard model of physics has no Majorana fermions, all particles are Dirac fermions. There are neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos. In the standard model, neutrinos have no mass, though. The question how to differentiate between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos is not settled yet.

There are different extensions of the standard model. One of them is called Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. It allows for supersymmetry, and can transform one kind of particle, the bosons, into the other, the fermions. In condensed matter physics, bound Majorana fermions can appear as quasiparticle excitations—the collective movement of several individual particles, not a single one, and they are governed by non-abelian statistics.

Numen

Numen, pl. numina, is a Latin term. It is used for "divinity", a "divine presence" or a "divine will." The Latin authors defined it as follows. Cicero writes of a "divine mind" ("divina mens"), a god "whose numen everything obeys," and a "divine power" ("vis divina") "which pervades the lives of men." It causes the motions and cries of birds during augury. In his Aeneid, Virgil tells about the how the one-eyed giant, Polyphemus, is blinded: First, Odysseus and his men "ask for the assistance of the great numina" ("magna precati numina"). Reviewing public opinion of Augustus on the day of his funeral, the historian Tacitus reports that some thought "no honor was left to the gods" when he "established the cult of himself" ("se ... coli vellet") "with temples and the effigies of numina" ("effigie numinum"). Pliny the younger in a letter to Paternus raves about the "power," the "dignity," and "the majesty;" in short, the ""numen" of history." Lucretius uses the expression "numen mentis", or "bidding of the mind," where "bidding" is "numen", not, however, the divine numen, unless the mind is to be considered divine, but as simply human will.

Since the early 20th century, numen has sometimes been treated in the history of religion as a pre-animistic phase. This is a belief system that comes from an earlier time. Sociologists also use the term "Numen" to refer to the idea of magical power coming from an object, particularly when writing about ideas in the western tradition. When used in this sense, "numen" means almost the same thing as "mana". However, some authors only use the word "mana" for ideas about magic from Polynesia and Southeast Asia.

The literal meaning is simply "a nod", or more accurately,"that which is produced by nodding". In the same way, "flamen" is "that which is produced by blowing", "i.e.", a gust of wind. It came to mean "the product or expression of power" — not, be it noted, power itself."Numen" (divinity) is not personified (although it can be a personal attribute) and should be distinguished from "deus" (god).

Numen was also used in the imperial cult of ancient Rome, to refer to the guardian-spirit, 'godhead' or divine power of a living emperor. It was a way of worshiping a living emperor without literally calling him a god.

The cult of Augustus was promoted by Tiberius, who dedicated the "Ara Numinis Augusti".
In this context, a distinction can be made between the terms "numen" and "genius".

The expression "Numen inest" appears in Ovid's "Fasti" (III, 296) and has been translated as 'There is a spirit here'. Its interpretation, and the exact sense of "numen" has been discussed extensively in the literature.

Some people thought, that numen could have been a leftover of ealier animist religions which was incorporated into the Roman religion. Sometimes the etymology of Latin names for deities, has often been popularly implied, but it was criticised as "mostly a scholarly fiction" by McGeough (2004).

The phrase "numen eris caeloque redux mirabere regna" appears on line 129 of the poem "Metrum in Genesin", attributed to Hilary of Arles.

In modern times, the term (referring to the Christian God) has been used in various expressions:

Dirac fermion

In particle physics, a Dirac fermion is a particle that is different from its antiparticle. This is true for most particles. In the standard model of physics, each particle has its antiparticle. They are named for Paul Dirac, and can be modeled with the Dirac equation.

A Dirac fermion is equivalent to two Weyl fermions. The counterpart to a Dirac fermion is a Majorana fermion, a particle that must be its own antiparticle. Neutrinos are particles without an electric charge, they might be Majorana fermions.

Tino rangatiratanga

Tino rangatiratanga is a Māori language term that means "absolute sovereignty." Sovereignty means absolute power to rule something without someone else interfering. In this case, it refers to the ability of the Māori people (the indigenous people of New Zealand) to rule themselves and be recognized as the owners of the land. ""Tino rangatiratanga"" shows up in the Māori version of the Treaty of Waitangi, which they signed with the British in 1840. They were promised that they would have "tino rangatiratanga" forever in the treaty. However, this concept was not respected since the British colonizers took a lot of things from the Māori people. To this day, people in New Zealand do not agree on what ""tino rangatiratanga"" means or what kind of things it is supposed to cover.

A "rangatira" is a chief in the Māori culture. The suffix -tanga is added so "rangatiratanga" refers to the qualities of being a chief. ""Tino"" is a Māori word that means "most" or "absolute." So by using this term, the British were allowing Maori chiefs to have complete control and allow them to use their powers as chiefs.

Some people think that the term can be used to describe self-determination, autonomy, or Māori independence.

Here are the meaning of the terms from an online Māori dictionary:



There is a lot of confusion about the Treaty of Waitangi because Articles 1 and 2 in the treaty say different things.
According to the Māori version of the treaty, Article 1 is talking about "kawanatanga" (governorship) while Article 2 is talking about "tino rangatiratanga" (absolute chieftainship). To them, these are two totally different concepts. Therefore, they believe that they never gave away their land rights and ability to rule themselves. In fact, a tribunal that was created to focus on the Treaty of Waitangi said that the Māori can never give up those rights and never did.

There is a Tino rangatiratanga flag that is used to represent the Māori people. It is red, white, and black. It was designed by Māori artists Hiraina Marsden, Jan Smith and Linda Munn in 1990 as part of a contest.

A woman named Poua Erstich came up with the meaning for the flag. The red represents the sky, the black is earth, and the white is light separating the sky and earth. The flag is supposed to show the Māori story of how the world was created.

This flag is flown next to the flag of New Zealand to show people that the land still belongs to the Māori. Sometimes, this flag is used in protests to show how certain issues are affecting Māori.

Executive order

An executive order or executive decree is a rule or order, or a law made by a head of state (president or monarch) who has this power given to him by the constitution of the country. The order tells ministries, agencies, the civil service and the military of a state the things that they must do.

Executive orders can be stopped by the courts in a process called judicial review. They may be stopped by the courts or the legislature if they are against laws or against the constitution. 

However, in countries where there is no real separation of powers and the head of state is actually a dictator, the executive order cannot be stopped by the courts or the legislature, which as a result have no powers and are controlled by him. In many cases, the head of state with dictatorial powers often rules the country by making executive orders rather than making laws in the legislature which he also controls.

Executive orders have a big effect on the internal affairs of the government and on the citizens. They decide how and to what degree legislation will be enforced. They also deal with emergencies and wars.

American Pie (song)

American Pie is an American popular song, written by singer-songwriter Don McLean.

The song was recorded and included in his album "American Pie" album in 1971. It reached no.1 on the Billboard hit chart. We consider this song is the longest song ever made among top hits of American popular songs. Because its playing time is beyond 8 minutes. "American Pie" was selected as the fifth important "Song of the Century", announced by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Recording Industry Association of America.

The original song in the album is accompanied by the guitar, piano and strings section. He also played the song with his guitar alone at the BBC studio live in 1972.The RollingStone reported the BBC live, too.

His original rough notes of the song has been a topic. They are often noted as an important historical piece in America. In May 2015 the original lyrics written by himself was sold in market publicly (at an auction). This news surprised people all over the world. He sold the original lyrics at auction for $1.5 million (£800,000). It is said that there are four handwritten copies of the handwritten lyrics to “American Pie.” A 18-page copy consists of 237 lines. One copy was sold at the auction as already mentioned, and a second copy sold for $100,000 in August 2017.

Many people say this song include a political message. Some say "the jester on the sidelines" is Bob Dylan, "the king with the thorny crown" is Elvis Presley. Others say "the quartet in the park" is The Beatles. He also sang in the song about the 1959 plane crash that ended the lives of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper .

"All roads lead to American Pie," said Don McLean of the song that made him famous. "As American as apple pie was the saying. It was some kind of a big American song that I wanted to write, which would be a conclusion for my show and bring all the songs home, which it still does. I can go anywhere I want with American music and come home to that. And it all makes sense." 

In this way, he has never been explaining the real intention or meaning of the song in the past interviews. He just said, “I was around in 1970 and now I am around in 2015... there is no poetry and very little romance in anything anymore, so it is really like the last phase of American Pie.” Many details in the song still remains in mystery, as he did not mention anymore.

The Wilmington insurrection of 1898, also known as the Wilmington massacre of 1898 or the Wilmington coup of 1898, happened in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Thursday, November 10, 1898.

The event was caused after many white supremacists took over the Wilmington city government which was controlled by both white and black men and killed the black alderman. After the event, no black politician was in charge in Wilmington.

It has been called a race riot caused by blacks by white newspapers at the time.

It is seen as the only coup in American history.

Chess in Azerbaijan

Chess is one of the most popular sports in Azerbaijan, where it is organized by the Azerbaijan Chess Federation (ACF). On May 5, 2009 Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev, who is also the chairman of the National Olympic Committee, signed an executive order starting a state-supported chess development program, covering the years 2009–2014.

Chess may be found in the works of 12th century Persian poets such as Khaqani and Nizami, who lived in modern-day Azerbaijan, and also in the works of 16th century Azerbaijani writer and poet Fuzuli and others. Azerbaijani writer and philosopher Mirza Fatali Akhundov explained the rules of chess in his 1864 poem "The Game of Shatranj".

Organized chess began in Azerbaijan shortly after the creation of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic in 1920, and the game soon became widespread. The first chess column appeared in the newspaper "Bakinsky Rabochy" in the early 1920s. In 1923 the first Baku championship took place.

On May 2–3, 1929, a match between teams from Baku and Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, was held on 8 boards in Baku.

In 1934 the first Azerbaijani Championship took place. This was won by Selimkhanov, who in 1935 became chairman of the Azerbaijan Chess Organization. In 1936 the first Women's Championship was held. In 1936, A. Polisskaya of Baku became women's champion of the South Caucasus. In 1938, a women's chess school was opened at the Baku Chess and Checkers Club.
However, these chess championships at the local and national level were not held every year and the World War II, disrupted the chess tournaments and activities. But since 1947 chess championships have been held every year.

After Azerbaijan gained its independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Azerbaijani chess players have achieved high results in various international competitions, World and European championships. In 1992, the national team of women for the first time at the World Chess Olympiad in Manila, Philippines represented independent Azerbaijan and ranked 7th among 67 teams. The women team won bronze medals at the European Championship held in Debrecen, Hungary in 1993. The national team of men won bronze medals in 2007 in European Championship held in Greece. Men's team won the title of “Europe’s strongest team” in Serbia in 2009, then won silver medals in 2011 in Greece and in 2013 in Poland. In 2012 and 2014, the men's team “SOCAR-Azerbaijan” won the inter-club European Championships twice. Azerbaijani Grandmasters Shahriyar Mammadyarov, Teymur Radjabov and Vugar Hashimov managed to rise to the 4th and 6th places in the world rankings.

Grandmaster Teymur Radjabov became the first owner of the World Chess Cup in the history of Azerbaijan on October 4, 2019, in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia.

Bart's Friend Falls in Love

"Bart's Friend Falls in Love" is the 22nd episode of the 3rd season of The Simpsons. It was first shown on television on May 7, 1992. In the episode, Bart's friend Milhouse gets a girlfriend named Samantha Stanky. Bart gets jealous and tells Samantha's father about the relationship. Samantha's father sends her to a different school that only allows girls. While this happens, Homer tries to lose weight using a subliminal stimuli cassette tape. However, Homer is given a tape about using better vocabulary instead.

The beginning of the episode is a parody of the movie "Raiders of the Lost Ark". The end of the episode is a parody of the movie "Casablanca".

Milhouse shows Bart his new toy, a Magic 8-Ball. Bart asks the Magic 8-Ball if he and Milhouse will still be friends at the end of the day. The Magic 8-Ball says that they will not. A girl from Phoenix, Arizona named Samantha Stanky becomes a new student at the Springfield Elementary School. Milhouse falls in love with Samantha. When school is over, Milhouse brings Samantha to Bart's treehouse and kiss each other. 

Milhouse does not spend time with Bart anymore. This makes Bart feel jealous and left out. Bart tells Samantha's father about her relationship. Samantha's father gets angry at her and puts her in a catholic school that is for girls. Bart starts to feel guilty when he sees that Milhouse is very sad, so he tells Milhouse that he told Samantha's father about the relationship. Milhouse gets very angry and fights Bart. When they calm down, they go to the school that Samantha has been put in. Samantha loves the new school, but she still loves Milhouse. She kisses Milhouse, knowing that she will get punished for doing so.

While this happens, Lisa thinks that Homer is too obese. Marge orders a cassette tape that will subliminally get Homer to lose weight. However, they are given a tape on how to have better vocabulary. Homer has been using more complex words, but he is also getting more weight. When Homer finds out that the tape is only making him more obese, he throws the tape away and no longer uses complex words.

Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said that the episode is a "keeper". He says that the episode "gets into pre-teen emotions but never becomes sappy."
