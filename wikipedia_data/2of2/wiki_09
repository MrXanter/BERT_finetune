Láadan

Láadan is a feminist constructed language. Its creator was Suzette Haden Elgin. She believed that Western languages were better for saying what men think than what women think. She created the language to make it easier for women to say what they think. For example, Láadan has many words and suffixes for saying how you feel about what you are saying. It also includes words for saying if you know that what you are saying is true, and if so, how.

The language became part of a series of science fiction books, Native Tongue. In the book, a group of women create Láadan as a way to fight a society ruled by men.

Láadan is a tonal language. Some syllables are said in a higher voice or tone than others. There are two tones:
Láadan itself is a three-syllable word, LA-a-dan, where the first syllable is said in a high tone.

Láadan has five vowels:

Láadan does not have the consonants p, t, k, g, or s. The consonants b, d, sh, m, n, l, r, w, y, and h are the same as in English. There is also:

Most Láadan sentences have three short words called particles:
In Láadan, the verbs come first. Verbs are the same words as adjectives. There are no articles like an or the. The object of a verb has the suffix -(e)th. It usually comes after the subject. The prefix me- says that the subject of a verb is plural. The word "ra" means the same thing as English "not".

New Láadan words are made by adding prefixes and suffixes to old words. Each part of a word stays the same when it combines with other parts. Because of this, it is called an agglutinative language. The affixes (prefixes and suffixes) can be used to show feelings and attitudes. Many languages can only show these by tone of voice, body language, or roundabout speech.

Pronouns in Láadan are made of many parts. The letter "l" is used for I and we. The letter "n" is used for you. The letter "b" is used for he, she, it, and they.

The vowel "e" usually comes after these letters. "a" can come after them instead to show that someone is loved. If the person is hated, "lhe-" can be put before the word.

The suffix "-zh" makes a pronoun plural but less than four. "-n" makes it plural and greater than four. So "lazh" means "we, who are few and loved." "Lheben" means "they, who are many and who I hate."

In 1961, He performed the first successful Kidney transplant between humans who were not identical twins. He was also a member of a team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, who developed a device that can preserve kidneys for up to 50 hours from the time they are taken from a person's body. It is now used in hospitals and research labs around the world.

Samuel Lee Kountz first became interested in medicine at the age of eight, when he went with an injured friend to a local hospital for emergency treatment. He says he was so moved by the way the doctors' helped his friend, that he decided from that moment to become a doctor. During his senior year of high school, Kountz had met Senator J. William Fulbright, who had once been president of the University of Arkansas. The senator was so impressed by Kountz's energy and enthusiasm, that he urged him to consider the medical school at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock. Kountz applied but was turned down. He spent the next two years finishing up his graduate work in chemistry at the university's Fayetteville campus. He did so well that he was awarded a full medical scholarship, and in 1954 became the first black student to be admitted to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.Kountz completed a master's degree in chemistry in 1956; two years later he received his M.D. He spent the next year as an intern with the Stanford Service of San Francisco General Hospital. In 1959, he began his surgical training at the Stanford University School of Medicine. It was at Stanford that he studied in organ transplants, and decided to make transplant surgery his life's work. In 1976 Kountz performed a kidney transplant on live television, The Today Show and inspired some 20,000 viewers to offer their kidneys to patients who needed them. In 1972 Kountz had been appointed Professor of Surgery and Chairman of the Department at the State University of New York's Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York. He also served as Surgeon-in-Chief of Kings County Hospital. The University of Arkansas awarded him the honorary Juris Doctor in 1973. Doctor Kountz also developed the largest kidney transplant research and training program in the country at the University of California, San Francisco.

His illness was never diagnosed, and he died on December 23, 1981, at the age of 51. At the time of his death, he had personally performed some 500 kidney transplants, the most performed by any physician in the world at that time.

Cell (Dragon Ball)

Cell (Japanese: セル, "Seru") is a fictional character in the "Dragon Ball" manga and third major villain in "Dragon Ball Z" anime.

He first appears in chapter #361 "The Mysterious Monster, Finally Appears!!" (謎の怪物、ついに出現!! "Nazo no Kaibutsu, Tsui ni Shutsugen!!) "first published in "Weekly Shōnen Jump" on March 2, 1992. Cell is an evil artificial life form, created using cells from several of the main characters in the series, that travels back in time so he can become the perfect warrior. In order to do this, he must absorb Androids #17 and #18.

In his "Imperfect" form, Cell walks fully upright on two legs (unlike his "larval" form). His facial features have not yet fully complete and he still retains an orifice-like mouth rather than normal human-like features seen in later forms. The two sections of his head go off in a V-shape. Cell has orange color parts near his abdominal area, the back of his head, and even near the area where gentials would be found. He has two wings which are both green with black spots.He has three fingers in the manga, but five fingers and three toes (just as similar as Frieza and King Cold) in the anime. He has a tail like Frieza and King Cold, but also has a stinger on the end of it. He has black sections as well near his abdominal area, in the middle between the two sections on his head, and even the black part of the opposite side of his tail. He even has visible veins in both of his arms, legs, and even some in the joints in his upper body. His eyes are pink (blue in the manga colored pages) with thin reptilian slits.

In his "Semi-Perfect" form, Cell's wings disappear, and he becomes much more humanoid, he also becomes quite a bit more muscular. While the nose is not yet fully formed, he now has an actual mouth. The two sections of his head now go straight into the air. In this form, he is taller. His tail is longer and slightly thicker than before, and comes from his back, as well as becoming orange and black. His voice is deeper than his first form. The back of his head and the black section on his forehead are now formed together as a ball in between the two sections on his head. His lips are now the color pink, and the black sections above his lips look like a mustache (but it's part of his skin). He now has light blue eyes in this form (a result of absorbing Android 17). He even has boot-like feet in this form and metal-like plates all around both of his ankles. He has the same shape of ears as Frieza's, except that his have an orange line that goes down to the chin and to both sides of the ears. His wings retreat completely into his back. In his self-destruction form, Semi-Perfect Cell bloats himself, his belly greatly expanding in size. He also claimed that his bloated appearance was unstable, and that a single touch may set him off when dissuading Gohan from trying to stop him.

In his "Perfect" form, Cell becomes much more humanoid and more intelligent, complete with both a fully-formed nose and mouth. His tail is retracted and now used to create Cell Jr's. He is also smaller than in his previous form. His wings have grown back and now are shaded black. His body is colored light-green with black spots and has black plates located on his shoulders and chest, and the plates on his ankles as well as the previously orange section near his groin are now shaded black. His skin is now pale all in his face, neck and hands, he now has purple lines in both sides of his cheeks, similar to Frieza in his first three forms, and the orange line across his ears and chin is now changed into a yellow color. His eyes are now pink, and his blue veins are now purple.

Medgar Evers

Medgar Wiley Evers (July 2, 1925June 12, 1963) was an American civil rights activist from Decatur Mississippi. He is best known for his work to overturn racial segregation in the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s. He was a World War II veteran. He became a field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). After the 1954 ruling of the United States Supreme Court in "Brown v. Board of Education" that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, Evers worked to get African Americans admitted to the all-white University of Mississippi. He also worked for other changes in the nation's then-segregated society, such as voting rights and registration, economic opportunity, and access to public facilities for African Americans.
Evers was assassinated by Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the “White Citizens' Council, a group formed in 1954 to resist integration of schools and civil rights activity in America. His murder and the resulting trials led to many civil rights protests. An all-white jury failed to convict De La Beckwith in his first two trials. He was finally convicted, however, 30 years later in a new state trial in 1994 that was based on new evidence. Evers’ wife Myrlie Evers, later became a noted activist in her own right, serving as national chair of the NAACP. His brother Charles Evers became the first African-American mayor elected in the state of Mississippi in 1969 in Fayette, Mississippi. 

Evers was the third of the five children born to Jesse (Wright) and James Evers. The family included his father Jesse's two children from a previous marriage. The Evers family owned a small farm, and his father also worked at a sawmill. Evers walked twelve miles to attend segregated schools, and earned his high school diploma. Evers served in the United States Army during World War II from 1943 to 1945. He fought in the Battle of Normandy in June 1944. After the end of the war, Evers was honorably discharged as a sergeant.

In 1948, Evers enrolled at Alcorn College, now Alcorn State University majoring in business administration. He also competed on the debate, football, and track teams, sang in the choir, and was junior class president. He earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1952. He married classmate Myrlie Beasley in 1951 while they were still in college. Together they had three children: Darrell Kenyatta, Reena Denise, and James Van Dyke Evers.The couple moved to Mound Bayou, Mississippi, a town that was founded by African Americans. There Evers became a salesman for T. R. M. Howard's Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1954, Evers applied to the segregated University of Mississippi Law School as a test case for the NAACP, but his application was rejected because of his race. In late 1954, Evers was named the NAACP's first field secretary for Mississippi. In this position, he helped organize boycotts and set up new local chapters of the NAACP. He was involved with James Meredith's efforts to enroll in the University of Mississippi in the early 1960s. Evers also helped Dr. Gilbert Mason, Sr., organize the Biloxi, Mississippi wade-ins, protests against segregation of public beaches on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

Evers' civil rights work and leadership made him a target of white supremacists. His public investigations into the 1955 lynching of teenager Emmett Till had made him a prominent black leader. On May 28, 1963, a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the carport of his home. 
On June 12, 1963, Evers pulled into his driveway after returning from a meeting with NAACP lawyers. As he was getting out of his car he was shot in the back and the bullet passed through his heart. He was taken to a hospital in Jackson, Mississippi where he was first refused entry because of his race. After his family explained who he was, the hospital went on and admitted him. He died in the hospital about 50 minutes later.As a veteran, Evers was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

The river flows only through the Belluno, Treviso and Venice provinces in the Veneto region and flows into the Adriatic Sea to the northwest of Venice, next to the port of "Cortellazzo", between the "comuni" of Eraclea and Jesolo. To the left of the mouth, there is a lagoon called "Laguna del Mort" formed by an old branch of the river.

Battle of Thebes

Thebes had been under Macedonian occupation since the battle of Chaeronea, which had resulted in the defeat and deposition of Thebes as the pre-eminent city-state of Southern Greece. The Thebans had reluctantly accepted this, as well as their compulsory membership in the League of Corinth, which had been previously imposed by Phillip II of Macedon, Alexander's father.

The expedition against Persia had been long in the works, and Alexander did not make it a secret that he planned to avenge the attacks on Greece by Persia a century and a half before, despite that at the time his kingdom had been a Persian vassal state. It was as a result of this planned expedition that King Darius III started to distribute money to the Greek city-states with the hope that they would rise against their new Hegemon. In addition to this, he had sent his most able general Memnon of Rhodes against the Macedonian troops that were already stationed in Ionia at this time.

In addition to this, news of Alexander had not reached the southern Greek city states for some time. He had been busy with the siege of Pelium and a rumour had reached them that he had died during the course of this siege. Demosthenes - a prominent Athenian politician - produced a man who claimed to have been present at the siege and claimed that Alexander was dead. Alexander had, indeed, been injured during this siege, so it was not a totally implausible claim to make.

Upon learning of the alleged death of Alexander, Theban exiles in Athens raced off to their native city in Boeotia and sought to incite a revolt from Macedonian rule there. The Cadmaea, the citadel that was situated upon a hill in Thebes, was occupied by a Macedonian garrison, and it was this place that the Thebans sought to attack. To this effect, they killed two Macedonian officers who had been roaming the city, and declared their independence from Macedonia.

Clothes iron

A clothes iron (also flatiron or smoothing iron) has a handle and a flat triangle shaped surface. Electricity makes the flat surface hot. A hot iron is rubbed on clothes to make them flat and smooth. This is called ironing. The handle does not get hot because that is where it is held. They are named clothes irons because they used to be made out of the metal iron.

Cloth is made from lots of small strings. When people wear clothes or move other things made from cloth, the little strings might bend and make lumps. Because the iron is heavy and hot when it is turned on, the little strings stretch and go flat when the iron is put on top. Different kinds of cloth need to be ironed in different ways. If the iron is too hot then the cloth might get broken or burn. If the iron is too cold then the strings might stay lumpy and not go flat. Sometimes people use water with an iron, which makes steam. This can make it easier to iron clothes because the small strings get soft. Some cloth does not need to be ironed because the strings always stays flat.

Some people think wearing clothes that have been ironed shows they are not lazy. Other people think that not ironing clothes can make them look nicer.

Win–loss record (pitching)

In baseball, a win–loss record shows the number of games that a pitcher has won and the number of games he has lost. In each game, one pitcher on the winning team is awarded a win (the "winning pitcher") and one pitcher on the losing team is given a loss (the "losing pitcher"). These pitchers are known as the pitchers of record. The awarding of a win or a loss for a pitcher is known as a "decision", and only one pitcher for each team receives a decision in each game. A starting pitcher who does not receive credit for a win or loss is said to have "no decision". In certain situations, another pitcher on the winning team who pitched in relief of the winning pitcher can be credited with a save, and holds can be awarded to relief pitchers on both sides, but these are never awarded to the same pitcher who is awarded the win.

Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident

The Wikipedia biography controversy, also known as the Seigenthaler incident, was a set of events that began in May 2005. Anonymous Wikipedia editors posted a hoax article in Wikipedia about John Seigenthaler. 

The article falsely stated that Seigenthaler had been a suspect in the deaths of U.S. President John F. Kennedy and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.

The then-78-year-old Seigenthaler, who was a friend of Robert Kennedy, described the Wikipedia article about him as "Internet character assassination".

The author of the hoax article was later identified as Brian Chase. On May 26, 2005, Chase added a new article that contained, in its entirety, the following text:

John Seigenthaler Sr. was the assistant to Attorney General Robert Kennedy in the early 1960s. For a short time, he was thought to have been directly involved in the Kennedy assassinations of both John, and his brother, Bobby. Nothing was ever proven.

John Seigenthaler moved to the Soviet Union in 1972, and returned to the United States in 1984.

He started one of the country's largest public relations firms shortly thereafter.
The hoax was not discovered and corrected until September 2005. Afterwards, Seigenthaler wrote about his experience in "USA Today". The incident raised questions about the and other websites with user-generated content that lack the legal accountability of traditional newspapers and published materials.

In a December 13 interview, co-founder Jimmy Wales expressed his support for Wikipedia policy allowing articles to be edited by anonymous users – describing the participation of editors in China and Iran in terms of privacy issues – but announced plans to roll back their article creation privileges as part of a vandalism-control strategy: "...we've decided that we want to slow down...so starting in January we're preventing unregistered users from creating new pages, because so often those have to be deleted...".

Qin Shi Huang

Qin Shi Huang (; 18 February 259 B.C. – 10 September 210 B.C.) was the founder of the Qin dynasty and was the first emperor of a unified China.

He was born Ying Zheng () or Zhao Zheng (), a prince of the state of Qin. He became the King Zheng of Qin () when he was thirteen, then China's first emperor when he was 38 after the Qin had ruled all of the other Warring States and unified all of China in 221 BC.

The First Emperor's father Yiren was the grandson of Ze, the ruler of Qin. The rulers of Qin and Zhao were from the same family, but the two lands fought against one another frequently. They wanted to make peace. King Ze gave his grandson Yiren to the leaders of Zhao so that, if Qin started to fight Zhao, the ruler of Zhao would kill Yiren and his family. Because King Ze would not want that, the ruler of Zhao was able to have less fear that Qin would fight him. (He also sent people from his family as prisoners to Qin so that things were even.)

While Yiren was a prisoner in Zhao, he met a trader named Lü Buwei. Lü knew that, when King Ze went to death, Yiren's father Lord Anguo would be the leader of Qin. Lü also knew that Yiren had many brothers but Yiren's father loved a woman who had no son. Lü worked hard to make that woman adopt Yiren (take him up as her son); Yiren even changed his name to Zichu ("son of Chu") because his new "mother" was from a land named Chu. Lü's design turned out well: he and Zichu secretly went out from Zhao and, when King Ze and Lord Anguo died, Zichu got to be the ruler of Qin.

The ruler of Zhao was angry but Zheng's mother hid. He was not able to kill her or her son. Zheng's mother had been the girlfriend of Lü Buwei, but Lü gave her to Yiren when he fell in love with her. Sima Qian was not certain that Zheng was the son of Zichu and not the son of Lü Buwei, but most people thought that he was the son of Zichu, ruler of Qin. When Zichu died, Zheng got to be the new ruler of Qin. Because he was still very young when this took place, his mother and Lü Buwei were the true rulers.

Later, Zheng was older and put Lü Buwei and his mother's new boyfriend to death. He put his mother away as a prisoner as well. Now, Zheng and his helper Li Si ruled Qin. Their ideas are called Legalism. It said that the old ways of doing things were not good: if everyone did as ordered by the ruler and by his laws, things would be much better. The best way to run a country was for the ruler to have all the power. That way, no one would be able to fight or hurt other people. As the ruler of Qin, Zheng liked these ideas; as the ruler of China, he said they would be the only ideas. He made Confucianism and other old ideas against the law. Only the library in his palace (great house) was able to have books with any old ideas or with other people's accounts of history. Everyone else would have to read about Legalism and the accounts of history approved by the Emperor. The First Emperor's men then burned the other books and even killed some of the men who tried to keep them by burying them (putting them under the earth).

As the ruler of China, the First Emperor ordered great undertakings: his men put together earlier bits into a Great Wall of China and made a new river—the Lingqu Canal—so that boats were able to go from the Yangtze River in the middle of China to the Pearl River in the south. He ordered a large number of new roads and a tomb (last resting place) for himself the size of a city. This resting place was looked after by the thousands of statues of the Terracotta Army. Many people did not like doing as the First Emperor ordered: Sima Qian wrote about three men who made attempts to kill the First Emperor. None of them were successful.

The First Emperor did not want to die. He went to Shandong and Jiangsu to look for people who would be able to make him live forever. No one was able to do that, but some people think that Xu Fu's journeys to look for Mount Penglai were important for Japan. This was about the time Japan's early Jōmon period ended and its Yayoi period started. The Yayoi period was the start of farming and the start of large countries in Japan. The First Emperor died in 210  BC.

The First Emperor had many sons, but his helpers Li Si and Zhao Gao tricked Fusu, his most liked son into killing himself. That way, a younger son became the Second Emperor and Li Si and Zhao Gao was able to be the true rulers for a while. The time when the First Emperor's family ruled China is named the Qin Dynasty, but it was very short. After the Qin Dynasty, there was more fighting before Liu Bei came out on top and got to be the new ruler of China. His family was named the Han Dynasty.

IFOR

The Implementation Force (IFOR) was a NATO-led multinational peace enforcement force in Bosnia and Herzegovina under a one-year mandate from 20 December 1995 to 20 December 1996 under the codename "Operation Joint Endeavour".

NATO was responsible for carrying out the Dayton Peace Accords. The Dayton Peace Accords were started on November 22, 1995 by the presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia, on behalf of Serbia and the Bosnian Serb Republic. The actual signing happened in Paris on December 14, 1995. The peace accords contained a General Framework Agreement and eleven supporting annexes with maps. The accords had three major goals: ending of hostilities, authorization of military and civilian program going into effect, and the establishment of a central Bosnian government while excluding individuals that serve sentences or under indictment by the International War Crimes Tribunals from taking part in the running of the government. IFOR's specific role was to implement the military Annexes of "The General Framework Agreement for Peace (GFAP) in Bosnia and Herzegovina".

IFOR relieved the UN peacekeeping force UNPROFOR, which had originally arrived in 1992, and the transfer of authority was discussed in Security Council Resolution 1031. Almost 60,000 NATO soldiers in addition to forces from non-NATO nations were deployed to Bosnia. Operation Decisive Endeavor (SACEUR OPLAN 40105), beginning 6 December 1995, was a subcomponent of Joint Endeavor.

The Dayton Agreement resulted from a long series of events. Notably, the failures of EU-led peace plans, the August 1995 Croat Operation Storm and its aftermath, the Bosnian Serb atrocities, in particular the Srebrenica massacre, and the seizure of UNPROFOR peace-keepers as human shields against NATO's Operation Deliberate Force.

Admiral Leighton W. Smith, Jr. (Commander in Chief Allied Forces Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH)) acted as the Joint Force Commander for the operation (also known as "Commander IFOR" (COMIFOR)). He commanded the operation from HQs in Zagreb and later from March 1996 from the Residency in Sarajevo. Lt Gen Michael Walker, Commander Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) acted as the Land Component Commander for the Operation, commanding from HQ ARRC (Forward) based initially in Kiseljak and from late January 1996 from HQ ARRC (Main) Ilidža. This was NATO's first ever out-of-area land deployment. The Land Component's part of the operation was known as Operation Firm Endeavour.

At its height, IFOR involved troops from 32 countries and numbered some 54,000 soldiers in-country (BiH) and around 80,000 involved soldiers in total (with support and reserve troops stationed in Croatia, Hungary, Germany, and Italy and also on ships in the Adriatic Sea). In the initial phases of the operation, much of the initial composition of IFOR consisted of units which had been part of UNPROFOR but remained in place and simply replaced their United Nations insignia with IFOR insignia.

There is no iron in ironstone. Its name is got because it is strong and durable. Ironstone was developed in the 19th century by potters in Staffordshire. It sold well as a cheaper alternative to porcelain.

Ironstone in Britain's Staffordshire potteries was made by Charles James Mason after his patent of 1813. The name "ironstone" later became generally used. The strength of Mason's ironstone enabled the company to produce ornamental objects of large size. Their vestibule vaseswere 1.5 metres high. Mantelpieces were made from several large sections. Mason's tableware was widely used in hotels and restaurants as well as private homes. It was usual for commercial clients to have the name of their establishment transfer printed onto the stoneware. 

Mason's was not the only manufacturer. Another high-class pottery was Spode, who made ironstone from 1805 onwards. They had big exports to France, where ironstone was often preferred to faience pottery.

During the mid-19th century The United states was the largest export market for Staffordshire's potteries. They bought plain white stoneware in huge quantities.

Antique ironstone wares are collectable, and in particular items made by Mason's.

During World War II he was confined by the Nazi regime to a Jewish ghetto. His children died in the ghetto, but he and his wife were deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Kristal survived the Holocaust, but his wife did not. He remarried shortly after the War and, in 1950, emigrated to Haifa, Israel, with his second wife Batsheva, also a survivor of the Holocaust, and their infant child, and lived in Haifa until his death at age 113 years, 330 days.

Mbah Gotho

Saparman Sodimejo, popularly known as Mbah Gotho, was an Indonesian man who gained attention for his claim of having lived over 140 years. Although there is no conclusive evidence to verify his exact age, The Indonesian Government reportedly recognised him as one of the oldest individuals based on an issued ID card.

Mbah Gotho's recollection of his birth date was uncertain, but he vividly remembered the construction of a sugar factory in 1890. In 2010, local authorities registered him as being over 140 years old, and in 2014, he was issued an ID card with a recorded birth date of 1870.

It is worth noting that the oldest person with documented evidence of their age is Jeanne Calment, who lived to the age of 122 years before passing away.

In May 2010, "Solopos" reported that the census had recorded his next birthday as his 142nd. That would have made him 19 years older than the oldest recorded person, Jeanne Calment, was when she died in 1997.

The "Liputan 6" website reported that Mbah Gotho's estimated age was 140. He could not remember his date of birth, but claimed to remember the construction of a sugar factory built in Sragen in 1890.

In August 2016, after a television report on Liputan 6, numerous international media outlets reported Gotho's claim. They then showed photographs of his ID card (issued in 2014), which displays his claimed birth date. 

Although Indonesian officials at the local record office confirmed the birth date there is no independent proof of his claimed age. That would have been required for the claim about the age to be recognised by record authorities, such as Guinness World Records. The Indonesian government did not register births before 1900, and there have been errors in the past.

The Gerontology Research Group commented that this extremely high claimed age was "fiction" and "unbelievable". The story on Liputan 6 noted other similar claims about age. That included a woman named "Maemunah" and known as "Ambu Unah", who had been claimed to be born in 1867, in Cimanuk, Pandeglang Regency.

On 28 April 2017 Mbah Gotho was admitted to RSUD Hospital for heart failure in Sragen and died two days later at 5:45 pm local time on 30 April 2017.

According to the BBC, he outlived ten siblings, four wives, and all of his children.

Nickel-iron battery

The nickel–iron battery (NiFe battery) are batteries made of iron and nickel oxide hydroxide, with a potassium hydroxide electrolyte. They are very strong, and do not break easily. They can last for more than 20 years. They are slow to charge. They are often used on trains. They are similar to the nickel cadmium battery, but using iron instead of toxic cadmium. The voltage is 1.2 volts per cell, the same as the nickel cadmium battery.

Nickel-iron batteries are very durable. They can be charged many times. They are often associated with Thomas Edison, although he did not invent this type of battery. Edison's company manufactured the batteries until the early 1970s. Today they are made by several Chinese companies. They are often used in applications where a very long service life is required, such as large off-grid solar power systems.

Borax

Borax is a chemical compound. It usually is in the form of a white powder. The powder has soft crystals. They are easy to dissolve in water. Its scientific name is "sodium borate". Miners find half of the borax in the world in the deserts of California. They discovered it in Death Valley in 1881.

Borax has many uses. It is an ingredient of many detergents, cosmetics, and enamel glazes. It is also used to make buffer solutions in biochemistry. Factories use it as a fire retardant, and to kill fungi that can harm the human body. It is also used in fiberglass, as a flux in metallurgy, slime, and as an insecticide. When mixed with water, it helps the soap clean dishes or clothes better. It can take the smell and stain off bathroom and kitchen surfaces. It also takes the smell out of shoes.

Maria Telkes used borax in the first solar-powered home, invented in 1948. The special walls of the home took energy from the sun and stored it in liquid salt. She used borax to keep the energy storage system running well. The borax kept bacteria from changing the salt solution into something different.

Washiqur Rahman, also spelled Oyasiqur Rhaman, was part of the 2013 Shabag movement, which called for the death penalty for Islamists for war crimes during the 1971 war for independence from Pakistan. 

Rahman used the pen name Kucchit Hasher Channa, or Ugly Duckling. Two students from an Islamic school were arrested by police. The two said they didn't know about Rahman's writing and they didn't know anything about blogs. Someone told them to kill Rahman as a religious duty. One of the attackers traveled from Chittagong and stayed overnight at a mosque. The other attacker was from an Islamic school in Dhaka. Rahman had a page on Facebook that said "I am Avijit", meaning he was a supporter of Avijit Roy, a Bangladeshi-American blogger who was killed a month earlier.

Murder of Faisal Abedin Deepan

Faisal Arefin Dipan (Bengali: ফয়সাল আরেফিন দীপন)(c. 1972 - 31 October 2015) was a Bangladeshi book publisher of the Jagriti Prokashoni publishing house. He was hacked to death inside his house in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital.

Deepan was a secular book publisher who printed writing that discussed topics like atheism and sexual orientation. He had received death threats from religious extremists. He published books by Bangladeshi-American writer and blogger Avijit Roy who was the four secular bloggers killed in Bangladesh the same year. Dipan's father said his company had published Avajit Roy's 2014 book, Biswasher Virus (The Virus of Faith).

An hour earlier, another publisher and two writers were attacked, but they survived. A local al-Qaeda group said they were responsible for the attack. Ahmed Rahim Tutal, a secular publisher, was attacked in his office at the Shudhdhoswar publishing house.

British politicians condemned the murder. British bishop Declan Lang, the chair of the international affairs department of the British bishops' conference, said that the Roman Catholic community in England and Wales should "speak out when people are imprisoned, tortured or killed on account of their atheism." Eric Adriaans, the National Executive Director of Centre For Inquiry Canada said that Canada should offer asylum to people targeted by religious extremists.

The International Publishers Association honored Deepan at their annual conference and called on the United Nations to do more about freedom of expression in Bangladesh. Tutul sent a message to the conference, saying: "If Jagriti Faisal Abedin Deepan were alive today, he would play an important role in this conference. But because he published free-thinking books, Islamist fundamentalists killed him. I urge all my publisher friends to continue to publish the works of free thinkers. I believe this is the best reply to the fundamentalists. By increasing the number of people that free-thinking books can reach, we'll be able to weaken fundamentalism in Bangladesh." Tutal also called for freedom for Bangladeshi writer and publisher, Shamsuzzoha Manik. Manik was arrested under a Bangladeshi law that prohibits criticism of religion. Manik is 73 years old and published a titled "Islam Bitorko" ("Debate on Islam").

Ramjet

A ramjet is a type of jet engine which uses the forward motion of the engine to produce thrust. Ramjets are most often attached to aircraft, and require that the aircraft is moving above the speed of sound (Mach 1). They are different from turbojets ("normal" aircraft engines) because they do not have any moving parts which compress the air. Instead, they use a shock cone to compress the air. The ramjet gets its name from this fact; it "rams" the air hard enough to compress it to a combustible pressure.

Ramjets are made up of 4 main sections.

The first section is called the inlet. The purpose of the inlet is to capture air and compress it. Compression is required in order to burn the fuel correctly. The compression comes from a process called a shock wave. Shock waves only occur when the aircraft is moving at or above Mach 1. For this reason, ramjets are more efficient if moving around Mach 2 or 3. 

The second part of the ramjet is called the diffuser. Air that comes through the inlet is moving very fast, which makes it very hard to burn fuel. The job of the diffuser is to slow the flow down in an efficient way. By the time the air has passed all the way through the inlet, it is traveling slower than Mach 1. This is important for the diffuser to work properly. The diffuser is essentially just a pipe that increases in area as you move along it. Because the flow moving slower than Mach 1, the increasing area causes the air to slow down.

The third part of the ramjet is the combustor, also called the combustion chamber. The combustor is where the fuel is introduced to the air, and then burns. Burning fuel adds energy to the air, which will be later used to create thrust. The air must be moving relatively slowly for the combustor to work properly. There is a part inside the combustor called the flame holder. The flame holder, as the name suggests, holds the flame in place. A typical flame holder looks like a ring of small v-shaped pieces of metal. They create little pockets of slow air, which make it easier for the fuel to keep burning.

After the fuel is burned and the air is heated, it flows through the last part, the nozzle. The purpose of the nozzle is to turn all of the energy in the air into thrust. In order to do this, the nozzle must first get smaller then get larger. The smallest area of the nozzle is called the "throat". The air coming from the combustor is moving slower than Mach 1, so as the nozzle gets smaller, the air speeds up. The nozzle is designed so that once the air reaches the throat, it has sped all the way up to Mach 1. This is an important detail for the nozzle to work properly. Once the air passes the throat, the air gets larger again. Since the flow reached Mach 1 in the throat, increasing the area also increases the speed of the air. This is the key to creating thrust. The air exiting the nozzle essentially "pushes" the ramjet forward.

James von Brunn

James Wenneker von Brunn (July 11, 1920 – January 6, 2010) was an American man who perpetrated the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum shooting in Washington, D.C. on June 10, 2009. Security guard Stephen Tyrone Johns was killed in the shooting, and von Brunn was wounded by two security guards who returned fire. Von Brunn was named the prime suspect in the shooting, and was charged with first-degree murder and firearms violations. While awaiting trial, von Brunn died on January 6, 2010.
Von Brunn was a white supremacist, neo-Nazi and Holocaust denier who had written numerous antisemitic essays, created an antisemitic website called "The Holy Western Empire", and is the author of a 1999 self-published book, "Kill the Best Gentiles", which praises Adolf Hitler and denies the Holocaust, including propagating the belief of a supposed white genocide. After the shooting, traces of his personal writings and works online were deleted from many websites, including AskArt.com, FreeRepublic and his personal user page on Wikipedia where he was indefinitely blocked, the latter said to constitute "a violation of policy of hate speech". He also made posts expressing his opposition to the Iraq War, and felt that the September 11 attacks were an "inside job".
Von Brunn was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the first of two children. His father was a native of Houston, Texas, and a superintendent at the Scullin Steel Mill in Houston during World War II. His mother was a piano teacher and homemaker.
Von Brunn enrolled in Washington University in St. Louis in August 1938, and received his Bachelor of Science degree in journalism in April 1943. During his time at the university, von Brunn was said to have been president of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter, and a varsity football player. He served in the United States Navy from 1943 to 1957, and was the commanding officer of PT boat 159 during the Pacific Theatre of World War II, receiving a commendation and three battle stars. Von Brunn had worked as an advertising executive and producer in New York City for twenty years. In the late 1960s, he relocated to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where he continued to do advertising work and resumed painting.
In the early 1970s, Von Brunn briefly worked for Noontide Press, the publishing arm of the Holocaust-denying Institute for Historical Review.
Von Brunn's arrest history dates back at least as far as the middle 1960s. In 1968, he received a six-month jail sentence in Maryland for fighting with a sheriff during an incident at the county jail. He had earlier been arrested for driving under the influence following an altercation at a local restaurant in 1966.
Von Brunn was arrested in 1981 for attempted kidnapping and hostage-taking of members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors after approaching the Federal Reserve's Eccles Building armed with a revolver, knife, and sawed-off shotgun. Von Brunn later described his actions as a "citizen's arrest for treason." He reportedly complained of "high interest rates" during the incident and was disarmed without any shots being fired, after threatening a security guard with a .38 caliber pistol. He reportedly claimed he had a bomb, which was found to be only a device designed to look like a bomb. He was convicted in 1983 for burglary, assault, weapons charges, and attempted kidnapping. Von Brunn's sentence was completed by September 15, 1989, after he had served six and a half years in prison. After he was released he successfully tested for and joined Mensa International; however, he was eventually dropped from membership for failing to pay his annual dues.
Von Brunn was a member of the American Friends of the British National Party, a group that raised funds in the United States for the far right and "rights for whites" British National Party (BNP). The group had been addressed on at least two occasions by Nick Griffin, an ex-member of the National Front and chairman of the BNP. A BNP spokesperson claimed after the shooting that the party had "never heard of" von Brunn.
In 2004 and 2005 he lived in Hayden Lake, Idaho, the town where Aryan Nations—a neo-Nazi organization led by Richard Butler—was based until 2001. Von Brunn was living in Annapolis, Maryland at the time of the 2009 incident.
After the shooting, federal authorities raided his apartment and seized a rifle, ammunition, computers, a handwritten will, and a painting of Jesus Christ standing adjacent to Adolf Hitler. The FBI also stated it discovered child pornography on one of the seized computers.
Von Brunn was charged in federal court on June 11, 2009, with first-degree murder and firearms violations; he pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. On July 29, 2009, von Brunn was indicted on seven counts, including four which made him eligible for the death penalty. In September 2009, a judge ordered von Brunn to undergo a competency evaluation to determine whether or not he could stand trial.
Von Brunn had the Federal Bureau of Prisons ID# 07128-016 and was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, North Carolina. On January 6, 2010, von Brunn died in a hospital located near the prison. According to a statement by his attorney, von Brunn had "a long history of poor health," including sepsis and chronic congestive heart failure.

The Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. condemned the attack. President Barack Obama said, "This outrageous act reminds us that we must remain vigilant against anti-Semitism and prejudice in all its forms."
The Southern Poverty Law Center, Anti-Defamation League, and FBI stated they had been monitoring von Brunn's internet postings, but were unable to take action because his comments had not crossed the line from free speech into advocating violence.
On June 11, 2009, the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) of Greater Washington and the InterFaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington led a prayer vigil which took place in front of the museum. Organizers said the vigil was a time to honor Stephen Johns, the slain officer, as well as a time to reflect upon the motivations which led to the shooting spree. Approximately 100 people attended the event, including officials from the Israeli and German embassies. The Council on American–Islamic Relations condemned the attack as well. When the museum reopened on June 12, 2009, Director Sara Bloomfield said attendance was normal or even higher than usual. Many visitors said their attendance was a statement against hate and intolerance. A 17-year-old girl who was in the museum the day of the shooting stated, "It's important to come back, because if you don't, they win. It's a form of terrorism."
In a statement, von Brunn's son, Erik, expressed sorrow and horror about the shooting. In an article he wrote for ABC News, he stated:

The younger von Brunn, who was 32 at the time of the 2009 shooting, did not meet his father until he was nearly 11 years old, after the elder von Brunn completed his prison term for the Federal Reserve incident.

Specific heat

Specific heat ("s") is a particular type of heat capacity. Specific heat is the thermodynamic property, which states the amount of heat required for a single unit of mass of a substance to be raised by one degree of temperature. Varying ranges of specific heat values are seen for substances depending on the extent to which they absorb heat. The term heat capacity can be misleading since heat "q" is the term given to the addition or removal of energy, across a barrier to a substance or system, as a result of increasing or decreasing the temperature respectively. Temperature changes are really changes in energy. Therefore, specific heat and other forms of heat capacity are more accurately measures of the capacity of a substance to absorb energy as the temperature of the substance increases.

Units are very important for expressing any thermodynamic property; the same is true for specific heat. Energy in the form of heat is expressed in Joules (J) or kilojoules (kJ) which are the most common units associated with energy. One unit of mass is measured in grams or kilograms with regard to specific heat. Per one gram is the standard form used in tables of specific heat values, but references using one kilogram are sometimes seen. One degree of temperature is measured on either the Celsius or Kelvin scale, but usually Celsius. The most commonly associated units then for specific heat are J/(g•°C).

Two factors that change the specific heat of a material are pressure and temperature. Specific heat is defined at a standard, constant pressure (usually atmospheric pressure) for materials and is generally reported at 25 °C (298.15 K). A standard temperature is used because specific heat has temperature dependence and can change at different temperature values. Specific heat is referred to as an ) As long as the temperature and pressure are at the standard referenced values and no phase change occurs, the value for the specific heat of any material remains constant regardless of the mass of the material present . 

A large factor in the magnitude of the specific heat of a material lies at the molecular level in the energetic available to the material in the phase (solid, liquid or gas) in which it is found. Energetic degrees of freedom are of four types: translation, rotation, vibration and electronic. A minimum amount of energy is needed to reach each degree of freedom. Therefore, the amount of energy that can be stored in a substance depends on the type and number of the energetic degrees of freedom that contribute to the substance at a given temperature. Liquids generally have more low energy modes and more energetic degrees of freedom than solids and most gases. This broader range of possibilities within the degrees of freedom typically generates larger specific heats for liquid substances than for solids or gases. This trend can be seen in the and by comparing liquid water to solid water (ice), copper, tin, oxygen, and graphite.

Specific heat is used to calculate the amount of heat absorbed when energy is added to a material or substance through an increase in temperature over a defined range. Calculation of the amount of heat or energy added to a material is a relatively easy process as long as the initial and the final temperatures of the material are recorded, the mass of the material is reported and the specific heat is known. The specific heat, the mass of the material and the temperature scale must all be in the same units in order to accurately perform the calculation for heat.

The equation for calculating heat ("q") is as follows:

formula_1

In the equation, s is the specific heat in (J/g•°C). m is the mass of the substance in grams. Δ"T refers to the change in temperature (°C) observed in the substance. The convention is to subtract the initial temperature of the material from the final temperature after heating so Δ"T is T-T in the equation. Substituting all the values into the equation and multiplying through cancels the units of mass and temperature leaving the appropriate units of Joules for heat. Calculations such as this are useful in 

Agustín Edwards Eastman

Agustín Iván Edmundo Edwards Eastman (24 November 1927 – 24 April 2017) was a Chilean newspaper publisher. He was one of the richest people in Chile. He inherited his family's newspaper company El Mercurio SAP, which publishes Chile's leading national dailies "El Mercurio" and "La Segunda". He was born in Paris.

Dante Parini

Dante Parini (Milan, 21 November 1890 – Milan, 11 April 1969) was an Italian painter and sculptor.

Parini studied at Accademia di Brera under the guidance of masters such as Enrico Butti along with Giannino Castiglioni with whom she shared ideas and projects becoming her friend. Parini left for the front of World War II where he was decorated for heroic acts.

He was a sculptor of monuments to the fallen soldiers of world wars and burial monuments, following the example of his Butti master with great technical skill and personal style.

It is its fountain-monument made in 1924 in Piazza Gran Paradiso in Milano in memory of the fallen of Niguarda. Amongst others are the monuments to the fallen of Tarquinia, a work inspired by profound sentiment and suffering humanity, and the monument to the soldiers fallen into Induno Olona war.

Some of his works are in the Monumental Cemetery of Milan, in Sanctuary of San Felice (Parabiago), and in the cemetery of Sarzana. He made a marble bas-relief in the church of Santa Maria at the Maggiore Hospital at Ca 'Granda in Milan with a subject "The healings of Christ". Several of his works are preserved at the Ospedale di Niguarda, known as ""the City of art"". In 1882 Dante Parini took part in the second competition for the execution of the sculptures of Vittoriano "Altar of the Homeland" in Rome, but his project was not chosen.
Dante Parini also devoted himself to painting. During his long life he participated in several international exhibitions.
In 1924 he received the Diploma of Honorary Member of the Accademia di Brera.

He was the first mayor of Brusimpiano after the end of World War II.



Annie Jump Cannon

Annie Jump Cannon was an American astronomer. She was born on December 11, 1863 in Dover, Delaware and died on April 13, 1941 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

With an old astronomy book, Cannon's mother taught her the constellations and other things about stars when she was little. She encouraged her to learn mathematics, chemistry and biology at Wellesley College. They loved the stars. After graduation she took up photography, and many of her pictures of Europe were published. She caught Scarlet fever which made her deaf. She became an instructor at Wellesley and learned spectroscopy.

Cannon was a great astronomer and gave us new information about the stars.

Cannon had graduate studies in math, physics, and astronomy. She also received many awards such as the Henry Draper Gold Medal of the National Academy of Sciences, the Ellen Richards Award, and she was the first woman to ever receive the honorary doctorate of science at Oxford University. She also became part of the Harvard Astronomy staff. She discovered 300 variable stars, five novae stars, and a binary star while on the staff. Cannon observed and then classified about 400,000 stars. She invented the Harvard system which is still the usual method of stellar classification according to color and temperature. 

Cannon had many hardships. Cannon was a women scientist in a world of men. She had to advocate for herself. She was one of the first women in astronomy at her time. Cannon also faced the hardship of being deaf. Cannon didn’t have access to hearing aids. People had decided not to vote for her for awards despite her discoveries because she was deaf. Now many people admire her and wish to follow in her footsteps. Cannon struggled in a world of stereotypes and first times but she managed to succeed.

IOS 11

iOS 11 is the eleventh major release of the iOS mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc., coming after iOS 10. It was announced at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5, 2017, and released on September 19, 2017.

Some of iOS 11's changes: the lock screen and Notification Center are combined, allowing all notifications to be displayed directly on the lock screen. The various pages of the Control Center are unified, gaining custom settings and the ability to 3D Touch icons for more options. The App Store receives a big visual change to focus on editorial content and daily highlights. A "Files" file manager app allows direct access to files stored locally and in cloud services. Siri can now translate between languages and use a privacy-minded "on-device learning" technique to better understand a user's interests and offer suggestions. The camera has new settings for better portrait-mode photos and will use new encoding technologies to reduce file sizes on newer devices. A previous point release also added support for person-to-person Apple Pay payments. The operating system also introduces the ability to record the screen, limited forms of drag-and-drop functionality, and support for augmented reality. Certain new features will appear only on iPad, including an always-accessible application dock, cross-app drag-and-drop, and a new user interface to show multiple apps at once.

iOS 11 received mixed reviews. People significantly praised the application dock and new multitasking interface on the iPad, crediting them for renewing the user experience. Further praise was directed at the redesigned Control Center offering customizable toggles, though it was criticized for lack of third-party app support, lack of Wi-Fi network selection ability and for difficult usage on small screen sizes, along with its instability. People also noted the new augmented reality development tools, but said their impact would depend on third-party apps and how fast developers embraced them. Praise was also directed at the App Store's redesign and the new file-management tools. Shortly after release, it was discovered that disabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections through the Control Center does not disable the respective chips in the device in order to remain functional for background connectivity, a design decision sparking criticism for "misleading" users and reducing security due to potential vulnerabilities in inactive open connections. The iOS 11.2 update added warning messages and a new toggle color to explain the new functions. iOS 11 has also received continuous criticism from reviewers and end-users for its perceived stability and performance issues, particularly on older devices; Apple issued numerous software updates to address such issues. 

Two months after release, 52% of iOS devices were running iOS 11, a slower adoption rate than previous iOS versions. The number increased to 81% of devices by May 2018.

On June 4, 2018, at the Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced its successor, iOS 12.

The user now has the option of downloading applications from a app store in Messages.

Night of terror

The Night of Terror refers to November 14, 1917 when several women were arrested for protesting in front of the White House for women's rights. This event is most known for the brutal torture of women in the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia. The 300 plus activists involved were fighting against President Woodrow Wilson for the right to vote. Thirty-three women were thrown in jail and these women were the ones who experienced the night of terror. Lucy Burns, one of the founders of the National Woman's Party was chained to her cell with her arms in the air. The women declared a hunger strike and in response, they were force-fed by being held down on a chair and having a long tube shoved down their throats. The jailers attached a funnel to the tube, and poured in mushed up raw eggs and milk for protein until they threw up. During the Night of Terror, Burns was beaten for calling out to other inmates, and her arms handcuffed above her head in her cell. Police officers hurled Dora Lewis into her cell, smashing her head against an iron bar. Her cellmate Alice Cosu thought she was dead, and suffered a heart attack. One woman was stabbed between the eyes with the broken staff of her banner at the Workhouse.

On February 18,1943, Sophie and her brother went to the Munich University to pass out leaflets. They were spotted by a custodian, who alerted the Gestapo. They were put on trial on February 22. They were sentenced to death. Before her death, her roommate, Else Gebel, recalls the last thing that Sophie said to her: “How can we expect righteousness to prevail when there is hardly anyone wiling to give himself up individually for a righteous cause? Such a fine, sunny, day, and I have to go, but what does my death matter, if through us, thousands of lives are awakened and stirred into action.”. She was killed the same day of the trial, February 22, 1943.

Sphygmomanometer

A sphygmomanometer ((, ; also called a blood pressure meter, blood pressure monitor, or blood pressure gauge) is a device used to measure blood pressure in humans. It was first invented by an Austrian physician in 1881. They now come in different shapes and sizes. They can be found in many places.

The sphygmomanometer works by wrapping a tube of fabric (called a "cuff") around the arm or other body part. The cuff is filled up with air. That stops the flow of blood in the arm. The air is then released slowly until the blood flows again. The whole process, from start to finish, only takes about a minute.

Many sphygmomanometers are inflated by squeezing a bulb. A gauge shows how much the cuff is inflated. The gauge can be mechanical or hydraulic (filled with mercury). It is important that the cuff is not inflated too much, so whoever is using the device has to use a stethoscope. 

Some sphygmomanometers, especially those that people use at home, are automatic. They inflate using an electric pump. They show the blood pressure on a screen. They are meant to be very easy to use.

Rivera was born on July 2, 1951 as Ray Rivera. As a child she found a growing interest in makeup. By grade 4 she was wearing makeup to school. Lacking the support she needed from her family, by age 10, her grandmother disapproved and put her out on the street. Rivera became a child sex worker in Times Square. Later on in her life, Rivera took an interest in human rights, specifically race and gender/sexual orientation. She created the organization STAR (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries) with her best friend, Marsha P. Johnson. 

But not too long after, Johnson was found dead, floating in the Hudson River. Rivera was devastated, and she even attempted suicide once. In the end, she died of liver cancer in 2002.

Casimir effect

The Casimir effect (predicted by Hendrik Casimir in 1948) is the attraction of two metal plates in a vacuum. This effect occurs because of a side effect of the quantum uncertainty principle, where 'virtual' particles cause the plates to be slightly pushed towards each other.

The quantum uncertainty principle says that particles, fields, etc. have two values, and that the more accurately you measure one, the less accurately you can measure the other. Since 'empty' space (which is a field) would be completely empty, then we would know both the field's magnitude (which is zero) and its rate of change (also zero). Therefore, there must be tiny fluctuations in 'empty' space, so that the uncertainty principle isn't violated. These take the form of virtual particles, which we wouldn't be able to detect directly. However, we can see the effects they have on real particles. Some of these particles are virtual photons, which can also be considered as waves. Now, between the reflective metal plates, there is a certain distance. Certain virtual photons, specifically ones where the distance divided by the wavelength is a whole number, are the only ones that can fit in here; if it isn't a whole number, eventually the peaks and troughs of the waves will coincide, and cancel it out.

Since there are fewer virtual particles on the inside of the plates rather than the outside, there is a greater force on the outside of the plates. This causes the plates to be pushed inwards. Now, the energy density of the universe is zero. This is because every particle has positive energy, but it also has gravity, which balances it out with negative gravitational energy. Since there are fewer virtual particles within the plates, that means that the energy density of the spacetime between the plates must be less than the energy density of spacetime outside the plates. However, since the energy density of the spacetime outside the plates is zero, that means that the energy density of the spacetime between the plates is less than zero, or negative. Negative spacetime has odd properties, such as being saddle-shaped and allowing travel into the past.

Orpheus and Eurydice

The ancient legend of Orpheus and Eurydice concerns the fateful love of Orpheus of Thrace, son of Apollo and the muse Calliope, for the beautiful Eurydice (from "Eurudike", "she whose justice extends widely").

Differential scanning calorimeter

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), is an analysis tool widely used in materials sciences, thermochemistry, drug purity and food quality testing. Its speed and ease of operation give instant information about the thermodynamic characteristics that play an important role in understanding complex processes during the formation of substances; for instance, polymer cross-linking, heat exchange due to folding and unfolding of proteins or formation mechanism of single or double stranded DNA. The DSC was firstly invented in 1962 by E.S. Watson and M.J. O’Neil and made available to the market in 1963 at the "Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy" conference held in Pittsburgh.

The two most common types of differential scanning calorimeter, are "heat flux DSC", which operates by keeping the heat supply to the system as constant and "power-compensated DSC", which works by maintaining the power supplied to the calorimeter as constant. In general, a DSC calculates heat changes by measuring the temperature difference between the sample and reference holder. The typical design of the "heat flux DSC" can be seen from Figure 1. It contains the "sample holder", where the material of interest is placed, and the "reference holder", which is generally kept empty. Both of these are placed on a "support", which is in good contact with the "walls" of calorimeter. The "heating resistor" is attached to the boundary walls that enables one to obtain a furnace generating and keeping the required heat amount inside the enclosure. The "thermocouple" connected to both sample and reference holder is a measuring device that gives the temperature to be used in the analysis. Heat supplied by the "heating resistor" flows further into the sample and the reference materials chambers.

The simplest theoretical approach to understand the working mechanism of DSC’s is called the simplified "linear model" and makes use of the following assumptions:

The Fourier’s law of heat conduction, which is the fundamental law explaining how the heat is transferred through materials can be used to see the relationship between the temperature and the heat flow in the system. This law states that the amount of heat energy passing through a small portion of an area (A) of a material, which is called heat flux density and denoted by formula_1 is equivalent to thermal conductivity (k) multiplied by the change in the temperature with respect to position, which can be denoted as formula_2. This relationship in an equation form can be written as,
formula_3

Generally, in DSC a computer is used to supply heat at specific rate into both the reference and sample holders. When the sample holder contains a substance while the reference kept empty leads to either increase or decrease in temperature of sample holder denoted by formula_4 depending on the following processes: 

Then, the resulting change in the heat flow due to these temperature variations can be found by using the Fourier's law as the following,

formula_5
or
formula_6

Hence, based on this simple model it turns out that there is a direct proportionality(K) between the heat flow and the temperature variations of the sample. This proportionality constant is dependent on the distance from the wall to the sample shown as (Δx), the cross section area of the support (A) and the thermal conductivity (k). Generally, the main results of the DSC experiment is an output signal of heat flow rate as a function of temperature, which are called DSC curves . Analysis of these curves plays an important role in determination of heat of transformation, heat of reactions or any changes in heat capacity due to temperature variations, for instance, the enthalpy of exothermic and endothermic processes can be determined by finding the area under the DSC curve using a mathematical technique called integral calculus.

One of the most important applications of DCS is related to the thermal unfolding of the proteins, a process called denaturation.The DCS’s role in this process is used to determine the temperature range over which proteins exhibit structural changes. In addition to that, when the protein solution is treated under constant heat rate and constant pressure, DSC can determine apparent heat capacities of the proteins. In fact, the denatured proteins turn out to have higher heat capacities and proper detection of changes on them over time can help to find out the extent of unfolding.

Food quality control is one of the most important issues for human health care and well-being. There has been reported many unlawful practices with regard to food products, specifically adulteration of some highly priced vegetable oils and fats. Adulteration is an action of mixing low quality and sometimes harmful ingredients with food products intended to be sold. In this field, DSC is used to analyze the thermal behaviour of lipids mainly by two processes, the cooling process, which reports information about the crystallisation and the heating process, which gives information on the melting behaviour of the building blocks of lipids. The adulteration in fats or oils changes the DSC cooling and heating curves. For example, new peaks appear and existing peaks undergo changes. Hence, analysis of DSC data can be used in estimation of adulteration process on nutrients.

DSC has gained quite a lot interest in drug purity investigation because it requires samples with low quantity (1–2 mg) and is considerably fast in terms of analysis time. For instance, by monitoring the effects of foreign substances, it can be found to what extent a drug is pure. It turns out that impurities decrease the melting temperature formula_7 of the drug. In addition, melting temperature can also be used to estimate the thermal stability of drugs, because the higher the formula_7 the more stable is the protein. Therefore, DSC allows instant monitoring of this temperature leading to much easier and faster way of controlling the drug quality.

Dina Ali Lasloom

Dina Ali Lasloom (; born 29 March 1993) is a Saudi Arabian teacher who was kidnapped in the Philippines. 

On April 11, 2017, she was traveling from Kuwait to Australia to ask for political asylum. She was stopped in Manila airport. She made a video with a cellphone. IN the video, she said they took her passport and papers. She said that her family would kill her. She wanted to escape a forced marriage. Dina borrowed a phone from a Canadian woman to make the video. In the video, Dina said she was locked up for 13 hours. Then two men came to the airport. Dina said they were her uncles. 

An airport security officer saw three men take Dina. They put duct tape on her hands, feet, and mouth. Then they put her in a wheelchair. THey took her on a Saudia Airlines flight to Riyadh. Other passengers said they heard her scream for help in the airplane.

The video went viral in Saudi Arabia. People used the hashtag #SaveDinaAli. Protesters were waiting for Dina at the Riyadh airport. One Saudi woman, Alaa Anazi, was arrested at the airport. Some women’s rights advocates in Saudi Arabia say Dina was taken to a women’s shelter. Others said Alla Anazi was taken to the shelter. Dina did not get off the airplane with the other passengers. 

Heat of combustion

The heat of combustion, also called calorific value or energy value of a substance is the amount of energy that is released when burning a given amount of the substance. This energy is released in the form of heat, when the substance is burned in standard conditions. 

Heat of combustion ("Δ"H"°") is the measure of the amount of energy released in the form of heat ("q") when one mole of a substance is burned (combustion). The production of heat means the reaction is an exothermic process and gives off energy. Heat of combustion is a specialized form of reaction enthalpy because it is measured at standard conditions and is limited to one mole starting material. The (°) symbol shows that the heat of combustion value is obtained at standard conditions: 25 degrees Celsius (298.15 Kelvin) and at a constant pressure. The pressure is reported both at either one bar or at one atmosphere depending on the source. 

Heat of combustion is also called the enthalpy of combustion because the energy evolved from the combustion reaction results from the change in the overall enthalpy of the starting substance as it reacts completely with oxygen. The terms heat of combustion and enthalpy of combustion are used interchangeably due to the First law of thermodynamics and the relationships between heat at constant pressure ("q"), the change in internal energy (ΔU), and the change in enthalpy (ΔH). 
The equation for the change in internal energy is

Δ"U" = "q - "PΔV. 

If the equation is rearranged, then

q = Δ"U" + "P"Δ"V".

The equation for the change in enthalpy is

Δ"H" = Δ"U" + "P"Δ"V" + "V"Δ"P". 

The term V"Δ"P cancels because there is no change in pressure so

Δ"H" = Δ"U" + "P"Δ"V".

As previously stated,

q = Δ"U" + "P"Δ"V".

Therefore, q = Δ"H".

Heat of combustion measurements are most common for the combustion of organic hydrocarbons, compounds composed of carbon and hydrogen, but can include other atoms found in organic compounds such as nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur and especially oxygen. Heat of combustion values are most widely used for determining if a substance is an effective fuel source. Many organic compounds can be found in Heat of Combustion Tables

The units for heat of combustion can be varied, but are always reported as a unit of energy per mole or per unit of mass or volume depending on the method used to report the values. To evaluate the efficiency of a substance as a fuel, energy per unit of mass or volume is more convenient. 

As with all combustions and many oxidation reactions, oxygen must be present in order for the substance to combust. Combustion reactions are carried out with oxygen at constant pressure in a calorimeter. A representative combustion reaction is that of methane (CH) in the presence of oxygen

CH(g) + O(g) → CO + HO(l)

The products of the combustion reaction are water and carbon dioxide gas as long as the reactants are oxygen and hydrocarbons. The water product can be in the form of gas or liquid depending on the temperature post-combustion. A true heat of combustion determination has liquid water at the end of the reaction due to the fact that the experiment is returned to the standard temperature of 25°C at which water condenses into liquid.

She married Run mac Arthgail, a king of Strathclyde from c. 872-878. He gave her one child, later to be king of Scots named Eochaid, who was deposed in 889 when she was 55 years old (dead or alive?). She also married Rí na h'Alt Clut who supposedly gave her no child as Eochaid is the only recorded child of NN ingen.
It is unknown when NN ingen Cináed died but would most likely be in the 860s to 880s sometime during or after the reign of Constantine I, Donald I and Eochaid, her son. She died in Ireland.

Macbeth, King of Scotland

Macbeth (Mac Bethad mac Findlaích in Gaelic) was King of Scotland from 1040-1057. William Shakespeare wrote a famous play about him called "Macbeth". In the play, Macbeth is an evil king who murders his cousin so he can become king.

Macbeth was born around 1005 in Morayshire, Scotland. His name in Gaelic was "Mac Bethad mac Findlaích" (in modern Gaelic, it is "MacBheatha mac Fhionnlaigh"), meaning "son of life". His father was Findláech mac Ruaidrí, Mormaer of Moray. When Macbeth was born, he became Mormaer of Moray. Macbeth's mother, Donada, may have been Malcolm II's second daughter.

In 1032, before he became king, Macbeth married Gruoch of Scotland (called "Lady Macbeth" in English). They remained married until his death in 1057. She died three years later, in 1060.

Macbeth may have had one child with Gruoch, but this is not certain. This child was Ferchar Og, Prince of Scots. 

Macbeth did have a stepson, Lulach, who succeeded him as king but died in 1058.

On 14 August 1040, Macbeth murdered his cousin King Duncan I in battle and was crowned King of Scotland. Macbeth was defeated by Duncan's son Malcolm (Canmore) and his ally Siward of Northumbria at Dunsinane Hill in 1054. Specifics of Macbeth's death are uncertain, being mortally wounded in skirmishing about the Cairn o'Mounth Pass into the Dee Valley, or at the Battle of Lumphanan on 15 August 1057. Macbeth was succeeded by his stepson Lulach the Simple (son of Gruoch by her first marriage), although Lulach's authority extended only over northern Scotland.

In 1058, Lulach was killed in battle at Essie by his cousin Malcolm III, who then became king.

Macbeth's burial most likely took place soon after his death. He was buried in Iona, Scotland. This is a place where many kings have been buried, starting with the mythical first King of Scots, Kenneth MacAlpin.

Macbeth is seen in a famous play by William Shakespeare, where he kills his cousin. In real life, Macbeth was more peaceful than this, though he did kill King Duncan I of Scotland.

Young kings of England

Since the reign of the first kings of England the question of who should rule next has been hard to answer. Examples of this are when Edward the Elder died leaving two sons Aelfward and Athelstan, but Aelfward died 28 days after Edward leaving the throne to Athelstan. But when a king picked his successor in the 1100s it was known as the young king. The next king, the prince of Wales usually got to reign as the young king of England before his ascension but both of the young/junior/titular kings never ascended to the throne.

The young kings of England in order of reign were:

Ever since Henry the Young the next in line has never been crowned as young king and just simply prince of Wales or just titled as "the rightful heir to the English throne".For kings of England, see List of English monarchs.

Constantine I of Scotland

Constantine I, nicknamed the Wine-Bountiful, was a son of Kenneth MacAlpin and was king of Picts "Rex Pictorium" from either 862/863 to 877 when he died in Fife, during a battle against Norse invaders. He was the nephew of his predecessor Donald I and the son of Kenneth MacAlpin I of the Picts and Queen Cinaeth MacDonald. He was styled as king of the Picts but now is traditionally referred to as king of Scots as many consider Kenneth I to be the first king of Scots.

Not much is known about Constantine's birth like many Scottish kings but he was born sometime around 836-844 in Iona, modern day Argyllshire, Scotland. He was the son of Kenneth MacAlpin, king of Scots and an unknown mother, he was a nephew of Donald I, brother to Aed and also to NN Ingen Cináeda.

When Donald I died in 862 of unknown causes, Constantine succeeded him and became the king of Picts, it is unknown if his reign began in 863 with his coronation or 862 with his ascension but most sources agree his reign began in April 862 after the death of his uncle Donald I.

In 877 fighting the Vikings in Fife, Constantine was killed. The throne passed to his brother Aed, as his son was considered too young to be king as he was only around 10 at the time. When Aed died in 878 the throne passed to Donald I, his uncle's son, Constantine's cousin Giric who ruled from 878-889, then finally followed by Constantine's son, Donald II, the last Pictish king who ruled from 889-900, all monarchs after him were styled "King of Alba" or Rex Alban

Like many early Scot monarchs his birth date cannot be confirmed, but most likely was sometime in the year c. 840, in Scotland. He may have been born in Ireland like some other of Kenneth's brothers and sons.

His reign began when he was around 36-37 years old in 877. He was murdered by Giric, a relative who took the throne after the murder/assassination of Áed in 878.

In 878, probably less than 1 year into his reign, Áed was murdered by Giric (possibly his nephew or cusion). He was buried in Iona, only 37/38 years old.

Áed was the son of Kenneth I, born when he was 30 years old. He is the son of an unknown mother and brother to kings Constantine I and princess NN Ingen Cináeda.

Pinch hitter

In baseball, a pinch hitter is a batter in place of another batter. Batters can be substituted at any time while there is not an active play. The manager may use any player who has not entered the game. Unlike basketball, American football, or ice hockey, baseball does not have a "free substitution rule". The player replaced by the pinch hitter is never allowed back into that game. The pinch hitter takes the spot in the batting order of the player that he replaces.

The player chosen to be a pinch hitter is often a backup infielder or outfielder. Catchers are not usually pinch hitters because most teams only have two catchers. Pitchers are also not used very often as pinch hitters because they are not very good hitters.

The American League of Major League Baseball, the Pacific League in Japan, the KBO League in Korea, and other leagues use the designated hitter rule. The designated hitter bats for the pitcher but does not play defense.

Saint Lawrence Seaway

The Saint Lawrence Seaway is a navigable waterway in North America. It is long and allows marine vessels to go from the Atlantic Ocean to all of the Great Lakes. Most of it is in Canada, but a small part of it is in the United States. It gets its name from the Saint Lawrence River, the river which goes from Lake Ontario to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

Before the Seaway was built, there was no way for boats and ships to get around the rapids and dams on the Saint Lawrence River. Big ships could not pass Niagara Falls, the waterfalls on the Niagara River between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. In the early 20th century, the governments of both Canada and the U.S. saw that the cities near the Great Lakes could grow and become an important part of the economy of both countries. There were people in both countries who did not want the Seaway to be built, but the project went ahead.

In 1954, construction began on a system of canals from Montreal in the east to Port Colborne in the west. It included 15 locks where the water level changes, and several places where electricity could be made from the flow of water. The project also involved making the Welland Canal bigger so that large ships can pass through it.

The Seaway was completed in 1959 at a cost of C$470 million. Today, thousands of vessels use it every year, from small recreational boats to huge ocean liners. About 40 to 50 million tonnes of cargo are moved on these ships and they go to all parts of the world including Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. It has been an important part of the economic growth of cities like Toronto, Hamilton, Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Chicago. There are plans to make the Seaway even wider so that container ships as big as those that travel through the Panama Canal can use it.

Dog bite prevention

Dog bite prevention is what can be done to stop dogs from biting. This takes work to educate people on what they can do to stop a dog from biting. People can get serious injuries or even die from dog bites. About 16,000–39,000 persons come near dogs and other animals that have rabies each year. These people receive immunizations to prevent or treat a rabies infection. Up to 800,000 Americans are treated for dog bites each year. Half of these are children. Young children get bitten by their family dog. Very old people are more likely to be bit than younger adults.

About 4.5 million people in the US get bit by dogs each year. One out of five bites become infected. Dog bites are painful. 
dog bites can cause injuries or even death.

If you know how to stop an dog from biting you will not be injured or die. Babies and children get bit more often than others. Small children can be bit if they walk toward or play with a dog. They should be watched by adults. Those children who are five-years-old to age nine are the most likely to be bit by a dog. Children need medical care for their bites more than adults. Men get bitten more than women. Over half of dog bites happen at home with dogs that are pets. If a home has many dogs then it is more likely that the people living in the home will be bitten. If there are two or more dogs in a home, the people in that home are fives more likely to be bitten.

When a dog is friendly it still may bite. If a dog wags its tail people think the dog is friendly. When a dog wags its tail it can be afraid, ready to fight, or angry. Dogs can wag their tail and then bite a person.

Government and other organizations have published information that can help stop a dog from biting. They say:

People may know if the dog has already been seen growling, snapping or biting. This may be a dangerous dog and bite people. Dogs can show if they are going to bite because of how they stand and act. People can learn how to see how the dog looks and act. People can learn the body language of dogs and know when the dog might bite. If the dog is snarling, has a wrinkled nose, eyes that are black, and fur that stands up, the dog is dangerous and might bite.

Just because a dog walks toward another dog or a person doesn't mean that it will bite. A dog is less likely to bite if more caution is practiced by the person. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have published materials so that children and others can know how they should act around a dog. Acting in a safe way will reduce the chance of a bite:

Even if you are attacked by a dog, you can protect yourself.

Find a doctor:

Training a dog makes it less dangerous. Children can learn how to not get bitten by a dog.

Anubias afzelii

Anubias afzelii is a plant in the Araceae family. It was first described for science in 1857 by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott. That description was based on material collected in Sierra Leone by Adam Afzelius. Schott named the species after him. The genus "Anubias" was described at the same time. Only "A. afzellii" belonged to it. This is therefore the type species of the genus. "A. afzelii" was the first species of this genus known to science.

The plant is found in West Africa: Senegal, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Mali.

The plant's leave blades are elongated (long and thin) and leathery. They can be up to long and wide. The leaf stems are generally shorter than the blade. The leaves are set on a creeping and rooting rhizome. It is thick. The spathe is long (sometimes up to 9 cm long). It has a long peduncle. The spadix is long (sometimes up to 12 cm long). It is a little bit longer than the spathe. Therefore, the tip of the spadix sticks a little bit out of the spathe. The upper part of the spadix is covered with male flowers. Their 5-6 stamens are fused. The anthers (also called thecae) are on the sides. The lower part of the spadix is covered with female flowers. These are reduced to the ovary and stigma.

The plant grows in wet, shady places. It flowers from the end of March to July. It fruits from April to September. The plant grows above water, but can sometimes be completely under water.

This plant grows best when only partly under water and when not crowded by other plants. It is most suited for the paludarium. It can also be used in larger aquariums, where it grows very slowly. It does not need much light. It prefers a temperature range of 22-26 °C. It can be propagated by dividing the rhizome. Propagation by seed is also easy.

5-demicube

In five-dimensional geometry, a demipenteract or 5-demicube is a semiregular 5-polytope, constructed from a "5-hypercube" (penteract) with alternated vertices removed.

It was discovered by Thorold Gosset. Since it was the only semiregular 5-polytope (made of more than one type of regular facets), he called it a 5-ic semi-regular. E. L. Elte identified it in 1912 as a semiregular polytope, labeling it as HM for a 5-dimensional "half measure" polytope.

Coxeter named this polytope as 1 from its Coxeter diagram, which has branches of length 2, 1 and 1 with a ringed node on one of the short branches, and Schläfli symbol formula_1 or {3,3}.

It exists in the k polytope family as 1 with the Gosset polytopes: 2, 3, and 4.

The graph formed by the vertices and edges of the demipenteract is sometimes called the Clebsch graph, though that name sometimes refers to the folded cube graph of order five instead.

Alberto Hurtado

Saint Alberto Hurtado Cruchaga, S.J. was a Jesuit priest who was canonized (recognized as a Catholic saint) on October 23, 2005, by Pope Benedict XVI. 

He was born Luis Alberto Hurtado Cruchaga on January 22, 1901, in Viña del Mar, Chile. He was of Basque origin. As well as being a Jesuit priest, he was also a lawyer, social worker, and writer. He founded the Hogar de Cristo Foundation. In Chile, he was popularly known as Padre Hurtado.

He died from cancer on August 18, 1952 in Santiago, Chile. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI canonized him.

Alberto's father died when he was four years old. After this, his mother had to sell, at a loss, their modest property in order to pay the family’s debts. Because the family was so poor, Alberto and his brother had to go to live with relatives and were often moved from one family member to another.

Alberto got a scholarship that allowed him to study at the famous all-boys Jesuit school of St. Ignacio, Santiago. He studied there from 1909 to 1917. At the parish and school, Hurtado assisted in the office and was librarian. During this time, he also volunteered at the Parroquia Nuestra Señora de Andacollo, a Catholic parish and school in a poor neighborhood of Santiago.

Fernando Vives, a teacher at the St. Ignacio school, was one of the most important people in Hurtado's life. Even during Vives' exile in Spain (1918–1935), they stayed in contact with each other. Vives was a great influence on Hurtado.

From 1918 to 1923, Hurtado attended the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. He studied in its law school and wrote his thesis on labour law. He had to interrupt his education because he was required to serve in the military. However, he was able to go back to school afterward, and earned his degree early in August 1923.

Rather than starting a career in law, Hurtado entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1923. 

In 1925, he went to Córdoba, Argentina, where he studied humanities. 

In 1927 he was sent to Barcelona, Spain, to study philosophy and theology, but because of the suppression of the Jesuits in Spain in 1931, he went on to Belgium and continued his studies in theology at Louvain. He was ordained a priest there on 24 August 1933, and in 1935 obtained a doctorate in pedagogy and psychology.

Hurtado was canonized on October 23, 2005, by Pope Benedict XVI, becoming his country's second saint.

Bob Beatty

Robert "Bob" Beatty is the head football coach for the Trinity Shamrocks, a high school football team located at Trinity High School in Louisville, Kentucky. He is the most successful High School Football coach in Kentucky state history, having won 12 state championship titles, and 1 National Championship over the course of his forty-year long career.

In 2011, he was named by "USA Today" as the National High School Coach of the Year. Beatty was the East's head coach at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in 2012.

In 2013, he was named by "Athlon Sports" as the tenth most important High School Football Coach in the United States. On January 10, 2017, he was given the Key to the City of Louisville, Kentucky, by Mayor (and Trinity graduate) Greg Fischer.

Beatty was born on June 7, 1955, in Butler, Missouri. In 1974, he went to Missouri Southern State College, where he graduated in 1978 with a Bachelor's in Education. In 1980, Beatty married his wife Jayne. They have two grown up children, Jennifer and David.

Beatty's Coaching Career began in 1978, when he took a job as an Assistant Coach at Clinton High School in Clinton, Missouri. He worked there for two years, then he moved to Liberty, Missouri. Beatty was also a teacher during that time.

In 1980, Beatty took a job as the Offensive Coordinator for William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri. He worked at the job from 1981 to 1986. Beatty then left the college and moved to Blue Springs, Missouri. Beatty was also a teacher during that time.

In 1986, Beatty took a job as the Offensive Coordinator at Blue Springs High School, in Blue Springs, Missouri. He was there until 1997, when he was offered the position of head coach. He took the role and was their head coach until the year 2000, when he moved to Louisville, Kentucky. Beatty was also a teacher during that time.

Beatty came to Trinity High School in 2000 to be the head coach of the Trinity Shamrocks Football team. The very next year, Beatty led the team to victory over rival Male High School in the 2001 state championship. Beatty kept up his winning streak by winning the state championships in 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012. However, in 2013, the Shamrocks ended the season 6-6. Beatty took this as a sign that his team needed a complete makeover. He said: "It's been a long time since we ended a season with a loss. You find out whether you want to spit that taste out of your mouth or swallow it again."

Beatty chose to follow up these words with a plan. He fired all but one of his defensive coordinators, and hired Jay Cobb, a former head coach at Knott County Central, Somerset, and Campbellsville, as the new defensive coordinator. After the shakeup, Trinity went on to win the state championship the next year in 2014, as well as in 2016.

In addition to serving as the Head Football Coach, Beatty also works at Trinity as a teacher for freshmen at the school. He teaches a course that combines Physical Education, as well as Health education, which includes information on drugs, alcohol and tobacco, as well as anatomy and physiology.

Below is a list of Trinity High School's State Championship Wins during the tenure of Head Coach Bob Beatty.
Below is a year-by-year breakdown of Beatty's coaching record at Trinity.

In late May 2013, a Trinity player approached Beatty and said, “I can’t wait for practice to start.” Beatty allegedly was startled by the comment. “You’re ready for me to scream and yell and cuss and spit?” he asked. “Sure,” the player said. “You’re not my friend. You’re my coach." According to Beatty, he had to smile, because that's the way he approaches his players. “I don’t have 17-year-old friends, I have 17-year-old champions."

According to Beatty, his team trains, practices, and plays for 11 months of the year. In 2013, he stated, "If you are going to be in this program, you have to punch the clock." In late April, when Beatty starts practices for the next season, Beatty allegedly tells his players "You better pray hard, because you belong to me now." He also stated in an interview that "We try to get more done in two hours than other teams do in two weeks. There are no superfluous meetings. It’s all about efficiency and winning."

Beatty has sent many of his former players to the NCAA D-I level. He coached quarterback Brian Brohm, who was featured on the cover of "Sports Illustrated" while he was a junior in high school at Trinity and who later played for the Louisville Cardinals, as well as with the Green Bay Packers and Buffalo Bills. Beatty also coached former quarterback Nick Petrino, who is the son of Louisville Cardinals football coach Bobby Petrino.

On May 9, 2017, McCabe became acting director after James Comey was fired from duties as Director by U.S. President Donald Trump. President Trump sent a letter to Comey informing him of his dismissal, referring to a recommendation to remove Comey from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.

In the absence of a Senate-confirmed Director, the deputy director automatically becomes acting director.

McCabe became deputy director again after Christopher A. Wray was sworn in as the new FBI Director on August 2, 2017.

On March 16, 2018, Sessions fired McCabe only 26 hours before his scheduled retirement. Sessions said he based his action on reports from the DOJ Inspector General and the FBI's disciplinary office saying that McCabe had made unauthorized releases of information to the media and had "lacked candor" in talking about it. McCabe denied that he had ever been dishonest and charged that his firing was politically motivated.

On April 19, 2018, the Department of Justice Inspector General had earlier sent a criminal referral to federal prosecutors for possible criminal charges against McCabe associated with allegations of lying to internal investigators.

Petrozavodsk

Petrozavodsk (Russian: Петрозаводск, Karelian/Vepsian/Finnish: Petroskoi) is a city in northwestern Russia and the administrative center of the Republic of Karelia. The city has a population of around 280,170 people.

Evidence shows that people have lived in the Petrozavodsk region since seven thousand years ago. At the end of the sixteenth century, there was a settlement in the region that was named "Onegaborg".

During the Finnish occupation of Petrozavodsk, the city was named "Äänislinna" (or "Ääneslinna"). The city was retaken by the Soviet army on 28 June 1944. The Finns set up concentration camps in the city for people of non-Finnic ethnicity. In total, six camps were set up; which in total held 23,984 civilians of Russian ethnicity.

In 1977, the Petrozavodsk phenomenon occurred. This was an incident where a glowing object showered the city with many rays. Many people now believe that it was caused by the launch of the Soviet satellite Kosmos 955.

This is mainly because of the city's position next to the Baltic Sea. The average annual temperature is 3.1 °C. Temperatures in winter range from 0 to -15 °C, in summer from +5 to +25 °C. The record high temperature was 33.9 °C (93.0 °F), and the record low temperature was −41.6 °C (−42.9 °F).

Joseph von Fraunhofer

Joseph Ritter von Fraunhofer (6 March 1787 – 7 June 1826) was a German physicist.

He was born in 1787 in Bavaria. When he was 11 years old, he had no father and no mother. Because of that, he had to work to survive. He worked making glass objects for a man called Philipp Anton Weichelsberger.

One day, in 1801, the place where Fraunhofer was working fell down and was destroyed. Fraunhofer was inside when this happened. Luckily, some people found him in the middle of the bits of the house and saved him. The Prince of Bavaria was with these people and he decided to help Fraunhofer.

The prince decided to give Fraunhofer money and books to study. He studied for five years and one day he was invited to work for a man called Joseph Utzschneider. This man had a company that made glass lenses to be used in scientific instruments. And this company had a secret laboratory in a monastery called Benediktbeuern. In this laboratory people were trying to discover how to make better glass lenses. Glass lenses at that time was a very complicated technology. After three years, Fraunhofer was one of the directors of this company. And after eight years he was a partner of the owner.

Fraunhofer died very sick in 1826, probably because of the time he worked as a child.

During his time in Benediktbeuern, Fraunhofer did experiments with glass. He discovered very important things about light. One day Fraunhofer was playing with a piece of glass called a prism and a telescope in a room full of sunlight. When he used the telescope to look at the glass, he discovered that he could see all colours of the rainbow. But there were black lines between the colours. Fraunhofer never discovered what the black lines were; he suggested they might be boundaries between different colors. Many years later, scientists discovered that these black spectral lines existed because some materials that exist in the sun and in the sky can absorb parts of the light. Today scientists use a similar technique to discover what chemicals are in stars and planets. The scientists who tried to find out what was happening call this part of science "spectroscopy".

Jasmine Directory

Jasmine Directory is a human-edited, partly for money web directory listing websites by topic and by region. This list offers a range of thirteen topics and one region-based list with hand-picked and reviewed users' suggested resources.

The project was created in 2006 at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics by Pecsi Andras and Robert Gombos and shown to the public in 2009. It was developed using a core code created by TOLRA Micro Systems Ltd.

In 2013 and 2014, Ken Anderson—editor at the Magic City Morning Star, early meta editor for the Open Directory Project (DMOZ), and editor at Go.com and Zeal directories—rated Jasmine Directory in his "Top Ten Web Directories", where each directory is reviewed quarterly.

Currently, Jasmine Directory is based in Valley Cottage, New York.

Jasmine Directory's editors add resources to the index by hand. Website owners can also suggest their websites for review by paying a fee. However, inclusion is not guaranteed if the suggested websites don't comply with the rules from the editors.

Because editors review every listing, search engines view listings in "quality directories" as valuable. Website owners report that submitting their sites to web directories can be worthwhile.

Ann Smarty—search marketer and writer at "Entrepreneur", Mashable, and Moz—mentions Jasmine Directory as providing a ""valuable user experience"".

The company claims that review by editors is key in maintaining a neutral and useful index of information that doesn't depend on how any single user sees things, as Matt Cutts mentioned in 2011.

Earl of Rothes

The Earl of Rothes was a title given to the ruler of Leslie, starting with George Leslie in 1458, given the title by James II of Scotland but has now evolved to a completely hereditary title since the local council now rules Leslie and has since around the 1950's. The title is mostfamous for being given to Norman Leslie, husband to Noel Leslie, a titanic survivor who died in 1956.

Another title given to the Earl of Rothes from 1445-possibly 1773 which was Lord Leslie but even then was a hereditary title to show their success in the Leslie family and Clan Leslie/Rothes.

James Malcolm Leslie has had no children and the heir at the moment is his brother Alexander John Leslie, the master of Rothes who will take over as earl following the death or abdication of James Malcolm Leslie.

Nöel Leslie, Countess of Rothes

"To see Norman Leslie, the husband of Noel see Norman Evelyn-Leslie, Earl of Rothes and to see the Earls of Rothes see list of Earls of Rothes since George Leslie (1458)."

Nöel Leslie was countess of Rothes and wife to Norman Leslie who was the earl of Rothes from 1893-1927. She married him in 1900 making her countess of Rothes. She is most famous for being a survivor of the 1912 Titanic disaster which killed over 2000 people.

Leslie was born on December 25, 1878 in Kensington, London, England, United Kingdom. She was later brought up in Gloucestershire.

During most of her childhood she lived in her parents residences of Prinknash Park in Gloucestershire and Chateau de Retival in Normandy and a townhouse in Kensington, London.

On April 19, 1900 (Primrose Day) she married Norman Leslie, who had been the Earl of Rothes for nearly 7 years making her the day they were married the countess of Rothes. She moved to Leslie in 1904 and lived with Norman for the rest of his life there.

On April 14, 1912 aboard the RMS Titanic Leslie survived the sinking and disaster which continued to April 15, she didn't die until 1956 (44 years after the disaster)

After the death of Norman in 1927 she married Claud Macfie, who died after Nöel and was her last husband. She also lost the title of countess when she married him and when Norman died.

Leslie died on September 12, 1956 in the same country she was born in, England. She was buried in Sussex, England and is now very famous among historians and others for her heroic tales during the titanic disaster and her rule as Countess of Rothes.

HeLa

The HeLa cell line is the oldest human cell line used in molecular biology research. Every cell in a cell line has the same genes. Since their discovery, scientists have been using HeLa cells to study cancer, radiation poisoning, and infectious disease. Like most cancer cells, HeLa cells have more DNA than normal cells. HeLa cells can also divide forever without the help of scientists. In contrast, normal, non-cancerous cells can only divide a for a little while before their telomeres shorten too much and the cell cannot divide any longer. Telomerase is an enzyme that maintains the length of telomeres in cells. HeLa cells have a special type of active telomerase that extends telomeres during regular division.

In 1951, these cells were found in a cervical tumor of 30 year old Henrietta Lacks. A sample of the tumor was taken during Lacks' stay at Johns Hopkins Hospital by a doctor named George Gey. He did this without telling her. Lacks died later that year, but her neither her nor her family were ever told about the cells until many decades later.

One of the most famous uses for HeLa cells came when Jonas Salk used these cells to test his vaccine, which now protects a lot of people against polio. Some of the more recent uses for HeLa cells are a Human papillomavirus vaccine made by Harold zur Hausen. This vaccine won him a Nobel Prize in 2008. Another use for HeLa cells is telomerase research, which won Elizabeth Blackburn a 2009 Nobel Prize. HeLa cells have also been used for the development of new chemotherapy techniques and to test how and where nuclear radiation mutates cells.

The use of HeLa cells has drawn some criticism. This is because Henrietta Lacks did not know that a piece of her tumor had been taken. When Lacks was identified nearly twenty years later, it raised a lot of questions about the issue of medical consent. Consent is when someone gives permission for something to happen. By law, there are several rules put in place to protect people involved in scientific research from harm. These rules also apply to research samples, which are allowed to be used as long as the quality of care is maintained and the patient identity is protected. One paper notes that if Henrietta Lacks were alive today, doctors would not need to ask for her consent.

Some people find it concerning that Henrietta Lacks wasn't asked for permission. This is because a lot of molecular biology techniques rely on DNA sequencing, so whenever the results of an experiment are published, the genetic information of the subject used is also put on full display. This is less of a problem when the identity of the sample's origin is fully protected, but troubling in the case of Henrietta Lacks. This is because full genome sequencing can reveal personal information like race, sex, and genetic history. In 2013, the entire HeLa cell line genome sequence was made public without the consent of Lacks' surviving family. Even though pieces of the HeLa genome have been sequenced separately, it is still possible to find genetic sequences that are often inherited together. This has the potential to reveal information about Lacks' surviving family. Critics argue that this represents a serious breach of privacy on behalf of the Lacks family. Since then, a new National Institutes of Health policy requires that researchers apply for special permission to access the full genome sequence.

Kettle (landform)

Kettles (also called potholes or kettle holes) are shallow bodies of water. They are filled with sediment. They are formed by retreating glaciers or by draining floodwaters.

Potholes can be formed when big blocks of ice break off of glaciers. The blocks become covered by sediment the glacier leaves behind. When the block melts, the hole it leaves behind is a pothole.

Potholes can also be formed when an ice-dammed lake suddenly drains away. As the ice melts, ramparts can form around the edge of the pothole. The lakes that fill these holes are usually deep or less. They eventually become filled with sediment. In acid conditions, a bog may form. In alkaline conditions, it will be peatland.

Kettles are landforms created by melted water from glaciers, a process called "fluvioglacial." When warming weather conditions cause a glacier to start melting, large blocks of ice can break off in a process called "calving." Rather than melting on the surface of the ground, the ice block can get partially or totally buried by dirt, rocks, and plant matter - the "sediment" carried in the glacier together with its ice content. This sediment piles up on the land where the glacier had been, a broad, smooth stretch called an "outwash plain" (or "sandur"). The kettle hole occurs when the exposed or buried ice block melts so that the surface of the sandur sinks. Multiple kettle holes can form near each other, and with the ridges and mounds of sediment around them the smooth surface of the sandur becomes irregular. Kettle holes can also occur in ridge-shaped deposits of loose rock chunks called "till."

Kettle holes can also form when a lake has a large amount of ice blocking the outlet where water drains from it, and the ice breaks up all at once. The flood that this causes can carry blocks of ice and sediment similar to the glacier-calf activity described above. These floods are called "jökulhlaups," an Islandic term used wherever this occurs. In 1992, the geologist Judith Maizels made outdoor observations and reproduced the conditions in a laboratory simulation. She found that protective walls (called ramparts) (protective walls) form around the edge of kettle holes made by jökulhlaup floods. The type of ramparts that develop depends on the how concentrated are the rock fragments contained in the melted ice block, and also on how deeply the block was buried by sediment.

Most kettle holes are less than two kilometres in diameter, although some in the U.S. Midwest exceed ten kilometres. Puslinch Lake in Ontario, Canada, is the largest kettle lake in Canada, covering . Fish Lake in the north-central Cascade Mountains of the U.S. state of Washington is .

The depth of most kettles is less than ten meters. In most cases, kettle holes eventually fill with water, sediment, or plant growth (vegetation). If the kettle gets more water from surface or underground rivers or streams, it becomes a kettle lake. If the kettle gets its water from rainfall and/or snowfall (precipitation), existing groundwater, or a combination of the two, it is termed a kettle pond. A kettle wetland is a kettle pond in which plant matter grows. Kettle ponds that are not affected by the local groundwater table will usually become dry during the warm summer months, in which case they are called "ephemeral" (something which disappears on its own).

If water in a kettle becomes acidic due to decomposing organic plant matter, it becomes a kettle bog. Otherwise, if underlying soils are lime-based, which has the effect of neutralizing the acidic conditions somewhat, it becomes a kettle peatland. Kettle bogs are closed ecosystems because they have no water source other than precipitation (rainfall and snowfall). Both acidic kettle bogs and fresh water kettles are important ecological niches for some symbiotic (mutually dependent) species of flora and fauna.

The Kettle Moraine, a region of Wisconsin covering an area from Green Bay at Lake Michigan to south-central Wisconsin, has numerous kettles, moraines and other glacial features. It has many kettle lakes, some of which are 100 to deep. Kettle Point, Ontario, Canada, has rock concretions (where sediment naturally cements into hard masses) locally named 'kettles', but there are no kettle lakes in this region.

The Prairie Pothole Region extends from northern Alberta, Canada to Iowa, United States and includes thousands of small sloughs (shallow bodies of usually stagnant water in a wetland) and lakes.

Alex decides to send Gene to a girl he likes, Addie McCallister, but Gene panics. This results in Alex sending an emoji with a weird face to Addie and Gene wrecking his workplace in the phone. Gene is threatened with deletion by a powerful Emoji called Smiler but is rescued by another Emoji called Hi-5 who tells Gene that he can be fixed if they find a hacker.

In the human world, Alex has started to think that his phone is broken. Back in the phone, Hi-5 and Gene visit another app and meet another emoji, a hacked called Jailbreak who wants to go to the cloud. The three emojis are chased by Smiler’s robots from app to app. During the adventure they also find out Jailbreak is actually a princess. A relationship starts to form between Gene and Jailbreak.

Automation

In the context of engineering, automation is when a device or a machine is changed in such a way that it can fulfill the task it was designed for without the need of human . Very often, this means that the machine is fitted with an additional system which takes control of its functions. For example, a centrifugal governor controls a steam engine.

Benefits of automation are that the output of the machine or device are more uniform, and that product quality is improved. A system that is not fully automated needs human interaction is needed: Many of the tasks involved are repetitive and boring. In general, machines are also designed so that humans no longer need to lift heavy weights or do dangerous things. With automation, human intervention is limited or absent.

The Nazis built Chełmno with the specific goal of carrying out ethnic cleansing through mass murder. The Nazis kept Chełmno open from , as part of Operation Reinhard during the most deadly phase of the Holocaust, and again from to during the Soviet counter-offensive.

The Nazis murdered over 150,000 people at Chełmno, including many Polish Jews from the Łódź Ghetto and the local people who lived in "Reichsgau Wartheland" ("Warthegau").

The Nazis killed at least 152,000 people at Chełmno. Nazi officials were eventually charged with killing at least 180,000 victims.

Euclidean distance

In Euclidean geometry, the Euclidean distance is the usual distance between two points "p" and "q". This distance is measured as a line segment. The Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate this distance.

This is equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem, where legs are differences between respective coordinates of the points, and hypotenuse is the distance.

Alternatively, if the polar coordinates of the point p are ("r", θ) and those of q are ("r", θ), then the distance between the points is

Neonatal progeroid syndrome

Neonatal progeroid syndrome, also known as Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome is an autosomal recessive progeroid syndrome. Is characterized by low birth weight and old-born baby appearance, with rare hair, elongated nose, unexplained cranial stitches, a characteristic facial dysmorphia associated with fat loss, and mild mental retardation. The disease results from damage to the FBN1 gene.

There have been over 51 cases of NPS. Rarely do they reach adulthood. The average life expectancy is 7 months. The syndrome was first described in 1979 by Hans-Rudolf Wiedemann, who previously described two cases of the disease: one in 1966 and another in 1977. Thomas Rautenstrauch in 1977 recognized the syndrome of two siblings as Progeria.

It is associated with abnormalities in bone maturation, lipid and metabolism. It iss very rare - less than 1 in million births.

Sound barrier

When an object comes closer to the speed of sound (Mach 1), air pressure changes drastically, and there will be pressure waves around the object. This pressure will rise until the speed of Mach 1 is reached. At this point, it will suddenly decrease, and a sound burst will result. The speed of Mach 1, where this burst happens, is often called sound barrier. Aircraft wings had to be redesigned, so that certain aircraft can fly at speeds faster than Mach 1. Flying faster than sound produces a sonic boom.

Hypersomnia

Hypersomnia is a medical condition which is characterized by unusual sleepiness. People with hypersomnia easily feel sleepy during the day, and fall asleep. The condition where people wake up often during the night, and have trouble sleeping through the night is called insomnia and is different. Hypersomnia is a sleep disorder. 

Hypersomnia affects about five percent of the population, or about one of twenty people. Very often, people with Sleep apnea suffer from hypersomnia. Hypersomia can also occur with other conditions, such as mood disorders. 

If the hypersomnia is caused by a problem with the brain or nervous system, it is called primary hypersomnia. Narcolepsy is an example of a primary hypersomnia. If the hypersomnia is the effect of another condition, it is usually called secondary hypersomnia. Examples of secondary hypersomnias include someone losing consciousness because of epilepsy. Sleep apnea, cited above, is one of the most common forms of secondary hypersomnia. Certain drugs can also cause (secondary) hypersomnias.

Primary hypersomnias are very rare. Secondary hypersomnias are quite common.

Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority

The Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (usually called the MBTA or "the T") is Massachusetts' public transportation system. 

The MBTA opened on September 2, 1897. Its first line, the Green Line, was the first subway in the Western Hemisphere. At first, it connected only the Boston Public Garden to Park Street Station - about a half-mile walk.

Today, all together, the parts of the MBTA travel 1392 miles each way, every day.

The MBTA uses many different forms of public transportation to connect most of the parts of Massachusetts. As of the MBTA's last official report in 2014, there are 295 different MBTA stations in Massachusetts.

The Commuter Rail covers more of Massachusetts than any other part of the MBTA. The Commuter Rail is a fast train, similar to an Amtrak commuter train. Of all the MBTA's services, the Commuter Rail runs the farthest from Boston. Because of this, it is also the most expensive.

In the MBTA's color-coding system, Commuter Rail Trains are purple.

As of 2014, there were a total of 138 Commuter Rail stations in Massachusetts.

All Commuter Rail trains start or finish their journeys at one of two stations in Boston: South Station or North Station.

Commuter Rail trains run to South Station from towns like:

When the New England Patriots are playing at home, the MBTA runs special Commuter Rail trains to Gillette Stadium from both South Station and T.F. Green Airport.

Closer to Boston, Commuter Rail trains stop at a few different Boston neighborhoods on their way to South Station, like Back Bay, Jamaica Plain, Hyde Park, and Dorchester. 

Travelers can change to the MBTA's Red Line subway at South Station.

Commuter Rail trains run to North Station from towns like:

Closer to Boston, Commuter Rail trains run through towns near Boston, like Cambridge, Chelsea, Medford, Melrose, and Belmont.

Travelers can change to the MBTA's Green or Orange Lines at North Station.

The subway runs mostly in Boston and in the towns next to it. There are five different subway lines, which are color-coded. Each line runs to a different part of the city. There are a total of 66 different subway routes in the Boston area. The lines cross each other at different points throughout the city so people can switch lines when they need to. A person does not have to pay to switch from one underground subway to another.

Each train runs in one of two directions: Inbound or Outbound. If a train is traveling toward Downtown Crossing, it is an Inbound train. If a train is traveling away from Downtown Crossing, it is an Outbound train.

The Orange Line began running in 1901. At that time, it was the first public transit in Boston that was elevated (on train tracks above the streets, instead of on the streets or underground).

The Orange Line runs from Malden to Jamaica Plain. It has 19 stops, including stops at Bunker Hill Community College, Tufts Medical Center, Boston's Chinatown, and Haymarket (a famous outdoor food market).

The Orange Line intersects with every other line on the MBTA. Travelers can change to any color subway or trolley car from the Orange Line.

The Red Line was the last of the four subway lines to be built.

Today, the Red Line runs from Cambridge to inner-city Boston. Important stops include Harvard Square Station; Kendall/MIT Station; Charles/Massachusetts General Hospital; and JFK/UMASS (the stop for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum and the University of Massachusetts Boston. The Red Line intersects with the Commuter Rail, and with every other subway except the Blue Line.

The Red Line is the most used subway line on the MBTA. On average, about 74,450,000 people make trips on the Red Line every year.

The Blue Line was built in 1904 as the world's widest underwater streetcar tunnel. (The Blue Line travels under the Charles River). By 1924, the Blue Line had been made into a subway.

Today, the Blue Line runs from Revere and East Boston to a small part of downtown Boston. It stops at Wonderland, which used to be a greyhound racing track; Suffolk Downs, which still is a horse racing track; Revere Beach; Logan Airport; Government Center, where Boston City Hall is located; and the New England Aquarium. Free shuttle buses take travelers from the Airport MBTA Station to the terminals in the airport.

The Blue Line is used less than any other MBTA subway line. About 17,880,000 people make trips on the Blue Line every year - about 76% less than the number of people who use the Red Line each year.

Part of the green line is a street trolley. It runs along train tracks in the middle of Boston's streets. However, some of the Green Line is a subway (underground). This part of the Green Line goes from Cambridge to downtown Boston. The Green Line then splits into five different street trolleys that travel to different neighborhoods around Boston.

Longwood Station on the D line, and the Longwood Medical Area Station on the E line, are within walking distance of multiple world-class hospitals, including Brigham and Women's Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Joslin Clinic for Diabetes, and Boston Children's Hospital.

The Green Line is the second most popular subway line on the MBTA. The Red Line is used a little more often.

There are four different street trolleys. These Green Line trolleys are called the "B," "C," "D," and "E" trains. There are many trolley stops on the MBTA - 61 in total.

Each train but the "E" train splits off from the underground subway at Kenmore Station. This is the station closest to Fenway Park, where the Boston Red Sox play.


The E train splits off from the underground subway at Copley Station. Its stops include the Prudential Tower, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Northeastern University, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Its last stop is at the VA Medical Center in Jamaica Plain. It is the only part of the MBTA that runs on tracks in the middle of the street.

The MBTA has 4 rapid transit bus lines with a total of 30 stops. These are color-coded silver:


The MBTA also includes commuter boat lines:


The MBTA operates 174 different buses. Together, these buses travel a total of 745 miles, one way, each day.

The two most commonly used buses on the MBTA both average about 14,000 riders every day:

This table gives a summary of the different parts of the MBTA:

Some travelers have brought up concerns about safety on the MBTA. In a 2011 article, "Boston Magazine's" Jason Schwartz described serious concerns about safety issues on the MBTA - like train fires, and crucial safety issues which he said the MBTA had not addressed. He wrote: "The system is broke, broken, and about to get a whole lot worse. No one on Beacon Hill [in the Massachusetts government] wants to address any of this ... History shows that it takes a tragedy - deaths - to fix something as basic as infrastructure. Hopefully Massachusetts won't wait for that."

In 2014, Robert Murch, a "world-renowned Ouija board" expert, joked that he is more afraid of taking the Red Line than he is of ghosts.

The MBTA has put many programs into place to help prevent crime and terrorism on the MBTA. The latest report published by the MBTA Transit Police compared crime rates in 2014 and 2015. Between 2014 and 2015, there was about a 7% increase in crimes on the MBTA. In 2014, there were 946 reported crimes on the MBTA. In 2015, there were 1009. Since over 380,900,000 people ride the MBTA each year, this means that about 0.0003% of travelers were victims of a crime while riding the MBTA in 2015. Most of these crimes were larceny, robbery, or assault.

Some Boston residents have criticized the slowness of the trains, especially the Green Line trolleys. Kyle Scott Clauss, the author of "The Curmudgeon's Guide to the MBTA," writes: "The C branch [of the Green Line] essentially functions as a sort of moving sidewalk leading to and from the Trader Joe's in Coolidge Corner. It was where Kenyan runner Rita Jeptoo memorably cruised past a Green Line trolley on her way to a first-place finish in the 2014 Boston Marathon."

The MBTA experienced a major crisis in winter of 2015. This was the snowiest winter in Boston's history, with six weeks of blizzards and heavy snowstorms. In February alone, 64.8 inches of snow fell in Boston. The MBTA's train tracks were so frozen and covered with snow that the trains could not drive. Kyle Scott Clauss of "The Curmudgeon's Guide to the MBTA" joked that "During the Snowpocalpyse of 2015 ... the T's newly installed countdown clocks all read "NOW I AM BECOME DEATH" and workers had to literally "set the rails ablaze" to keep them from freezing..."

The General Manager of the MBTA, Beverly Scott, shut down all rail service (all trains and trolleys) for over 36 hours. The MBTA had to hire hundreds of workers to shovel snow and chip ice off the tracks. On February 11, Scott announced that she would resign from her job, as of April 11, 2015.

Chicago Transit Authority

Chicago Transit Authority, also known as CTA, is the operator of mass transit in Chicago, Illinois and some of its surrounding suburbs, including the trains of the Chicago "L" and CTA bus service.

The CTA is an Illinois independent governmental agency that started operations on October 1, 1947 upon the purchase and combination of the transportation assets of the Chicago Rapid Transit Company and the Chicago Surface Lines streetcar system. In 1952, CTA purchased the assets of the Chicago Motor Coach Company, which was under the control of Yellow Cab Company founder John D. Hertz, resulting in a fully unified system. 

Today, the CTA is one of the three service boards financially supported by the Regional Transportation Authority.

Red Line (CTA)

The Red Line, sometimes known as the Howard-Dan Ryan Line or the North-South Line, is a rapid transit line in Chicago, run by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) as part of the Chicago "L" system. It is the busiest line on the "L" system, with an average of 251,813 passengers boarding each weekday in 2012. The route is long with a total of 33 stations, from Howard station in Rogers Park on the north side, through the State Street subway and to 95th/Dan Ryan in Roseland on the south side. 

Like the Blue Line, the Red Line runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; it is one of only five mass-transit rail systems in the United States to do so (the others being the PATCO Speedline, Staten Island Railway, the PATH lines, and the New York City Subway). 

Roman citizenship

People in Ancient Rome had certain rights depending on who they were. Some were citizens, and had rights that non-citizens did not have. The rights available to individual citizens of Rome varied over time, according to their place of origin and their service to the state. They also varied under Roman law according to the classification of the individual within the state. Various legal classes were defined by the various combinations of legal rights that each class enjoyed. 

Client state citizens and allies (socii) of Rome could receive a limited form of Roman citizenship such as the Latin Right. Such citizens could not vote or be elected in Roman elections. Slaves were considered property, not legal persons and unable to be citizens. Over time, they acquired a few protections under Roman law. 

Rights available to citizens under Roman law addressed included:

Ius suffragiorum: The right to vote in the Roman assemblies.

Ius gentium: The legal recognition, developed in the 3rd century BC, of the growing international scope of Roman affairs, and the need for Roman law to deal with situations between Roman citizens and foreign persons. The ius gentium was therefore a Roman legal codification of the widely accepted international law of the time, and was based on the highly developed commercial law of the Greek city-states and of other maritime powers. The rights afforded by the ius gentium were considered to be held by all persons; it is thus a concept of human rights rather than rights attached to citizenship.

Ius conubii: The right to have a lawful marriage with a Roman citizen according to Roman principles, to have the legal rights of the paterfamilias over the family, and for the children of any such marriage to be counted as Roman citizens.

Ius migrationis: The right to preserve one's level of citizenship upon relocation to a polis of comparable status. For example, members of the cives Romani (see below) maintained their full civitas when they migrated to a Roman colony with full rights under the law: a colonia civium Romanorum. Latins also had this right, and maintained their ius Latii if they relocated to a different Latin state or Latin colony (Latina colonia). This right did not preserve one's level of citizenship should one relocate to a colony of lesser legal status; full Roman citizens relocating to a Latina colonia were reduced to the level of the ius Latii, and such a migration and reduction in status had to be a voluntary act.

The right of immunity from some taxes and other legal obligations, especially local rules and regulations. 

The right to sue in the courts and the right to be sued. 

The right to have a legal trial (to appear before a proper court and to defend oneself). 

The toga was the characteristic garment of the rich Roman male citizen, and statues of emperors (here Antoninus Pius) frequently depict them togate (togatus).

Orange Line (CTA)

The Orange Line, is a rapid transit line in Chicago, Illinois run by the Chicago Transit Authority as part of the "L" system. It is about long and runs at grade and elevated on existing railroad embankments and new concrete and steel structures from Midway International Airport, the Southwest Side and downtown Chicago. In September 2012, the average weekday boardings on the Orange Line were 63,037. The Orange Line operates between Midway Airport and the Loop, weekdays from 4:00 a.m. to 1:25 a.m., and Saturdays and Sundays from 4:30 a.m. to 1:25 a.m.


Yellow Line (CTA)

The Yellow Line, formerly known as the Skokie Swift, is part of the Chicago Transit Authority's "L" system in Chicago, Illinois. The route runs from the Howard Terminal on the north side of Chicago, through the southern part of Evanston and to the Dempster Terminal in Skokie, Illinois, making one intermediate stop at Oakton Street in Skokie.

At Howard, Yellow Line passengers can transfer to the Purple or Red Lines of the CTA. The Yellow Line is the only CTA line that does not go to Chicago Loop.


Green Line (CTA)

The Green Line is a rapid transit line on the Chicago Transit Authority's "L" system. It is the only completely elevated route in the entire system. It utilizes the system's oldest segments (dating back to 1892), extending with 30 stops between Forest Park and Oak Park (Harlem/Lake), through Chicago's West Side to the Loop, and then to the South Side and Englewood (Ashland/63rd) and Woodlawn (Cottage Grove/63rd). 

As of September 2012, the average number weekday boardings on the Green Line is 70,554. The Green Line operates between Harlem/Lake and Cottage Grove, weekdays from 4:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m., and Saturdays and Sundays from 5:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m., and between Harlem/Lake and Ashland/63rd, weekdays from 3:50 a.m. to 1:05 a.m., and Saturdays and Sundays from 4:50 a.m. to 1:05 a.m.


Blue Line (CTA)

The Blue Line, also known as the O'Hare-Congress Line and the West-Northwest Line, is a long Chicago "L" line which goes through the Loop from O'Hare International Airport at the far northwest end of the city, through downtown via the Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway and across the West Side to its southwest end at Forest Park, with a total of 33 stations. It is the CTA's second busiest rail line, with an average of 186,796 passengers boarding each weekday in September 2012.

The Blue Line and Red Line are the only two routes of the Chicago "L" system to currently run 24 hours a day and is one of only six rapid transit rail systems in the United States to do so (the others being the PATCO Speedline, Staten Island Railway, the PATH lines, Philadelphia's SEPTA and the New York City Subway). 

The Blue Line is also one of only two lines with more than one station with the same name, with the Green Line being the other (It has two stations at Harlem Avenue: one in the Kennedy Expressway on the Northwest side and one on the south side of the Eisenhower Expressway in Forest Park, Illinois. It also has two stations on Western Avenue: one on the O'Hare branch and one on the Congress branch). The Blue Line also has only three in-system transfers (all in the Loop), contains a combination of both the oldest and newest portions of 'L' tracks, and does not share tracks with any other 'L' line.

Before the adoption of color-coded names, the Blue Line was referred to as the West-Northwest Route (which it is still sometimes referred to as today) or more commonly, the O'Hare-Congress-Douglas route for its three branches. The Congress and Douglas branches were renamed for their terminals, Forest Park and 54th/Cermak, when the current color naming system was adopted in 1993.

Treblinka extermination camp

Treblinka was a Nazi death camp during World War II. It was in Poland, which was controlled by Germany at that time. The camp was in a forest northeast of Warsaw.

The goal of death camps like Treblinka was to kill millions of people as quickly as possible. Treblinka was open from July 23, 1942, to October 19, 1943, during Operation Reinhard, the deadliest part of The Holocaust. At Treblinka, the Nazis killed at least 700,000 and 900,000 Jewish people, and at least 2,000 Roma people. The Nazis killed more Jews at Treblinka than at any death camp other than Auschwitz.

Nazi officials opened Treblinka in November 1941 as a forced labor camp. The Nazis sent two groups of people to Treblinka to work as slaves:

However, they kept the Jews and Poles in separate parts of the camp.

Most of the prisoners at Treblinka worked in a gravel pit; in an irrigation area; or in the forest, where they cut wood to fuel the camp's cremation ovens. 

Between 1941 and 1944, more than 20,000 people were prisoners at Treblinka I. More than half of them died from hunger, disease, mistreatment, and summary executions (executions without a trial).

In July 1942, the Nazis finished building Treblinka II, a death camp, about a mile from the labor camp (Treblinka I). At this time in history, the Nazis were already killing people at two other death camps: Belzec and Sobibor.

The Nazis committed genocide at Treblinka until November 1943. They murdered up to 925,000 Jewish people at the camp. They killed many of them with carbon monoxide in gas chambers.

Most Jewish men who were sent to Treblinka were killed right away. However, a few were chosen to be its slave-labor units, called "Sonderkommando." When the Nazis murdered people in the gas chambers, they forced the "Sonderkommando" to bury the victims' bodies in mass graves. These bodies were exhumed in 1943 and cremated on large open-air pyres, along with the bodies of new victims. 

In early August 1943, the "Sonderkommando" revolted. Several Nazi guards were killed and about 200 prisoners escaped from the camp; almost a hundred survived the subsequent chase. Because of this, in October 1943, the Nazis stopped killing prisoners in Treblinka's gas chambers.

In late July 1944, Soviet troops were getting close to Treblinka. There were between 300 and 700 Jewish prisoners left at the camp. The Nazi guards shot them all. The Nazis then quickly destroyed the camp. Before running away, they built a farmhouse for a watchman and sloughed over the ground to try to hide the evidence of their genocide. Then they ran away from the camp.

During the last week of July 1944, Soviet troops arrived at Treblinka.

As the son and heir of Indulf's predecessor, Malcolm I, Dub ascended to the throne instead of Indulf's son and heir, Culen. When Dub first realized that he is now king, he was overjoyed as he had been waiting eight years for this.

Since Indulf had many success at the Battle of Bauds, Dub's first act as king was to continue the battle. He actively fought in the battle and won against the Vikings. Next Dub wanted to expand stabilize, and make the kingdom more powerful. In 963, he built many towns for the poor people and would bring peace, stability, and prosperity to the Scottish people. All of this made him very popular and effective.

Pope Benedict XVI retired on 11 February 2013, and was the first pope to do this in recent history. Today, he is Pope Emeritus. Benedict XVI was a professor at the University of Regensburg.

Taliban insurgency

After the war in Afghanistan began in 2001, the Taliban started an insurgency, which is known as the Taliban insurgency. The Taliban started to attack the forces of ISAF and NATO, in Afghanistan, and committed many terrorist attacks. In the conflict, the Taliban fight against the Afghan government and its allies. Al-Qaeda is linked to the Taliban. With this, the conflict in the region spread to Pakistan. The related conflict in Pakistan is the insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Because Afghanistan has seen a number of conflicts and wars in recent decades, its economy has changed, and many people depend on growing cash crops, such as poppy seeds which are used to produce illegal drugs such as opium, or heroin. Many people in Afghanistan do not think the problems are caused by the Taliban. Resolving the problem will therefore probably involve more effort than winning against the Taliban. It will also mean that there need to be changes in the economy, and the way in which the country is run.

Currently, Afghanistan is one of the biggest producers of opium. While opium also has its uses as a regular drug, it is mainly used as an illegal drug. In 2001, Afghanistan produced only 11% of the world's opium, today it produces over ninety percent. In 2007, 93% of the "non-pharmaceutical-grade" opiates on the world market originated in Afghanistan. This amounts to an export value of about $4 billion; opium farmers earn about a quarter of this amount, the rest goes to district officials, insurgents, warlords, and drug traffickers. The drug trade accounts for half of Afghanistan's GDP.
Estimates made in 2006 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimate that 52% of the nation's GDP, or $2.7 billion annually, is generated by the drug trade.

Areas where the security situation is worse produce more Opium; areas that are more stable seem to produce less. Many farmers in rural areas depend on selling poppy seeds. Opium is more profitable than wheat and destroying opium fields could possibly lead to discontent or unrest among the affected population. Some 3.3 million Afghans are involved in producing opium. For this reason, some people say that eradicating poppy crops is not a viable option. Some poppy eradication programs have, however, proven effective, especially in the north of Afghanistan. The opium poppy eradication program of Balkh Governor Ustad Atta Mohammad Noor between 2005 and 2007 successfully reduced poppy cultivation in Balkh Province from 7,200 hectares in 2005 to zero by 2007.

The Afghanistan Opium Risk Assessment 2013, issued by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, suggests that the Taliban has since 2008 been supporting farmers growing poppy, as a source of income for the insurgency.

There have been wars and conflicts in Afghanistan for over thirty years. As a result, the country is among the poorest, and least developed countries in the world. It is also one of the most corrupt. Thirty-five percent of the poulation are unemployed, and more than half of the people live below the poverty line.

Western aid group Oxfam published an opinion poll they conducted in Afghanistan, in 2010. According to this poll, 83 percent of the Afghan population does not consider the Taliban to be militants. Poverty, unemployment and government corruption are seen as the main causes of war in their country. When the U.S.-backed Afghan forces ousted the Taliban in late 2001, the level of violence increased. Nearly half of those surveyed said corruption and bad government were the main reasons for the ongoing war. Twelve percent said the Taliban insurgency was to blame.After the Taliban, the reason most people gave for the continued fighting was foreign interference, with twenty-five percent of respondents saying other countries were to blame.

Since the start of 2006 Afghanistan has been facing a wave of attacks by improvised explosives and suicide bombers, particularly after NATO took command of the fight against insurgents in spring 2006.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai publicly condemned the methods used by the western powers. In June 2006 he said:

Insurgents were also criticized for their conduct. According to Human Rights Watch, bombing and other attacks on Afghan civilians by the Taliban (and to a lesser extent Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin), are reported to have "sharply escalated in 2006" with "at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at civilians or civilian objects." 131 of insurgent attacks were suicide attacks which killed 212 civilians (732 wounded), 46 Afghan army and police members (101 wounded), and 12 foreign soldiers (63 wounded).

The United Nations estimated that for the first half of 2011, the civilian deaths rose by 15% and reached 1462, which is the worst death toll since the beginning of the war, despite the increase of foreign troops.

Fruitarianism

Fruitarianism is a diet where people mostly eat fruits, and possibly nuts and seeds, without animal products. Fruitarianism is a strict of dietary veganism.

Fruitarians can become a fruitarian for different reasons, including ethical, religious, environmental, cultural, economic, and health reasons. There are many types of the diet. Some people whose diet consists of 75% or more fruit consider themselves fruitarians.

Some fruitarians will eat only what comes naturally from a plant: foods that can be harvested without killing or harming the plant. These foods consist primarily of culinary fruits, nuts, and seeds.  Some do not eat grains, believing it is unnatural to. Some fruitarians feel that humans shouldn't to eat seeds as they contain future plants,or nuts and seeds, or any foods besides juicy fruits. Others believe they should eat only plants that spread seeds when the plant is eaten. Others eat seeds and some cooked foods. Some fruitarians use beans, peas, or other legumes. Other fruitarians' diets include raw fruits, dried fruits, nuts, honey and olive oil, or fruits, nuts, beans and chocolate.SO different fruitarians do different things.

Some fruitarians who hold Judeo-Christian beliefs hold that fruitarianism was the original diet of humankind in the form of Adam and Eve, based on the Book of Genesis. They believe that a return to an Eden-like paradise will require simple living a health and diet.  Another common motivation is the desire to eliminate perceived toxicity within the body. For others, the appeal of a fruitarian diet comes from the challenge that the restrictive nature of this diet provides.

Pteropoda

Pteropods are free-swimming pelagic sea snails and sea slugs. They are marine opisthobranch gastropods. 

Are they a natural group? The monophyly of Pteropoda is the subject of debate. At present, by molecular studies, the group is monophyletic.

Pteropoda has two clades Thecosomata, the sea butterflies, and Gymnosomata, the sea angels. The Thecosomata have a shell, while the Gymnosomata ("naked body") do not. The two clades may or may not be sister taxa. If not, their similarity may reflect adaptation to their particular lifestyle.

All are pelagic, small, and transparent, and swim using wing-like flaps (parapodia) which protrude from their bodies.


The name "sea slug" is most often applied to nudibranchs, as well as to other marine gastropods without obvious shells.

Micro black hole

Micro black holes are very small black holes. Because they are small, they may shrink and disappear due to Hawking radiation. They may exist in nature as primordial black holes.

If a micro black hole decays, it would create particles that we could see. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is looking for gamma rays that might come from micro black holes in outer space.

If two particles with enough energy collide, they may create a black hole. Some scientists think the LHC can create one.

If the LHC did create a micro black hole, it would disappear immediately, and would not be dangerous. Cosmic rays hitting the Earth's atmosphere may already create these. If dangerous micro black holes are created by cosmic rays, then the Earth would already be damaged. Because the Earth is not damaged by black holes, scientists think they are not dangerous. This thought is like the Anthropic principle.

Plasma lamp

A plasma lamp is a type of gas discharge lamp that is filled with different gases. It uses dielectric barrier discharge, which is also known as plasma discharge. Nikola Tesla invented it to study the properties of plasma, in 1892. He obtained a patent in 1894. Tesla called the lamp Inert Gas Discharge Tube.

Plasma globe lamps were popular in the 1980s.

Hacker koan

A hacker koan is a funny short story about computer science. Hackers like the artificial intelligence (AI) group at MIT made the term. A book called the Jargon File has many koans called "AI Koans". Most koans are not the same as "kōans" in Zen Buddhism, but both kinds of koans are short, mysterious, and have a hidden meaning.

Like Zen koans, this might have a real and correct answer. In the story, the room is not really empty when Minsky shuts his eyes, and the neural network might still have assumed something when it is randomly set up. The assumptions are random instead of from a human, but they still exist.

This story may be from a real story from "" (chapter 6):

A story like this is in "The Tao of Programming".

Tom Knight might have written this. He helped make the Lisp machine at MIT:

This means that a simple idea can be the right idea.

This koan is sometimes called an "ice cream koan". The word "koan" sounds like "cone" in the phrase "ice cream cone", so the name is a pun. There is another "ice cream koan" in "The Dharma Bums". This koan talks about AI lab tools from before the GNU project:

Eric S. Raymond put the first AI Koans in a book called Hacker's Jargon Dictionary. He says that Danny Hillis created them when he was a student at MIT.

"The Codeless Code" is a different book about software engineers at big businesses instead of unix hackers. The stories in it are like traditional Zen koans. Every character is made-up, and most are masters and monks in a place like the Far East. The stories talk about things like making software. The name comes from a book called "The Gateless Gate".

Ñuble Province (1974–2018)

The Ñuble Province () was one of the provinces of the Chilean region of Bío Bío (VIII). The provincial capital was the city of Chillán.

It was the second province in area in the Bío Bío region, after the Bío Bío province, and the second with more people living in it, after the Concepción province.

Inversion (linguistics)

In linguistics, inversion is when the words in a sentence are in a different order than normal. The most common kind of inversion in English is subject–auxiliary inversion, which happens when an auxiliary verb (like "do") changes places with its subject. It usually happens in questions like "Are you coming?". In this example, the subject "you" is switched with the verb "are". In many other languages, like languages with a freer word order than English, inversion can also happen with more verbs (not just auxiliaries) and other kinds of words.

Northern England

Northern England, also known as the North of England, North Country or simply the North, is the northern part of England. People have different ideas about which parts of England are in Northern England, but it usually includes the counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, County Durham, Lancashire, Northumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire, as well as parts of Lincolnshire. There are big cities in Northern England, but there are also large mountains and lakes. The biggest Northern cities are Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Sheffield.

Northern England has a long history: it was where many battles between England and Scotland were fought, and it was the place where the Industrial Revolution began. Nowadays, most of the industry is gone and Northern England is poorer than Southern England. However, Northern England still has its own culture and way of speaking, and many Northerners are proud of the region.

The area roughly spans from the River Trent to the Scottish border in the north. However, people disagree about where the southern border is. Some people say Northern England starts near Birmingham, while some people say it only starts at the River Tees. The government says that Northern England is made up of three statistical regions: the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber. These have a combined population of around 14.9 million as of the 2011 Census and an area of 37,331 km (14,414 sq mi). 

Northern England contains much of England's national parkland but also has large areas of urbanization, including the conurbations of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Teesside, Tyneside, Wearside, South and West Yorkshire.

Mary Edwards Walker

Mary Edwards Walker (November 26, 1832 – February 21, 1919) was an American abolitionist, prohibitionist, prisoner of war and surgeon. As of 2017, she is the only woman ever to receive the Medal of Honor.

She was born on November 26, 1832. Growing up, she lived in Oswego, New York with her parents, Alvah Walker and Vesta Whitcomb Walker. Her parents taught her to always be driven and stand up for what she believed in. Her parents supported abolitionist groups and women’s rights movements. They believed everyone deserved to be treated equally and with respect no matter their race or gender. She used what she learned from her parents to help her accomplish her goals in life.

Her education was very important to her and her parents.  She studied to become a surgeon at Syracuse Medical College and graduated in 1855 with a medical degree. After college she met Albert Miller, also a physician. They got married in 1856 but she kept her last name as Walker.  After marriage, together they started a medical practice, but not many people wanted to go to a woman doctor as they did not trust she could do as good of a job as a man physician. The practice struggled and so did the young couples marriage. Thirteen years later Mary Walker and Albert Miller divorced and their practice failed. Although her marriage failed, she came back more confident than ever as the Civil War began.

At the break of the Civil War and with high confidence, Walker tried to enlist in the Union Army. She was denied because of her gender but did not take no for an answer. Trying again, she enlisted as a surgeon in the war and was transferred to the 52nd Ohio Infantry. Later she was appointed assistant surgeon. This was a very big accomplishment for a woman at this time.  During one of her trips to the Confederacy to tend to the sick and wounded, she was captured. During 1864 Walker was imprisoned for four months in Richmond, Virginia. After four months Walker, along with other surgeons in the Union, were released in a trade for 17 Confederate doctors. Even after her capture, Walker still continued to cross the line between the Confederates and Union to tend to the sick and wounded even after her experience of being imprisoned with the Confederates. Until the war ended, Walker remained with the 52nd Ohio Infantry, tending to the sick and wounded. Mary Edward Walker’s persistence and determination paid off as she served the sick and wounded on the battlefield, refusing to be pulled down because of her gender. 

Once the war had ended, Walker went back home to Oswego, New York. She was honored for her work. On November 11, 1865, she received the Congressional Medal of Honor. She was the first and only woman to ever receive this honor.  Soon after she got her medal, it was revoked by Congress because she was not involved in combat.  Walker did not let this get her down. Every single day, until she died, she wore her medal and refused to give it back. Since she almost never wore women’s clothing, she was arrested several times for wearing men’s clothing but never was put in jail. Walker believed that the Constitution gave women a right to vote and wear what they wanted. She died on February 21, 1919, three months before the 19th amendment was passed giving women the right to vote. After her death, she was remembered for her intelligence, bravery, and determination.

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter restored Mary Edwards Walker's medal. Walker was smart, kind, and helped change the face of women's rights to get it to the place it is today. At the time she was doing something that people believed was impossible: a woman becoming a doctor who served on a battlefield. She was different, and proved that it’s ok to take risks and to be bold in your beliefs. In 2012, a large statue of her was made in her hometown. A cargo ship, the SS Mary Walker was named after her in World War II. Multiple medical campuses were named after her and the post office put her on a stamp to honor her.

Generative adversarial networks

Generative adversarial networks are artificial neural networks that work together to give better answers. One neural network is the tricky network, and the other one is the useful network. The tricky network will try to give an input to the useful network that will cause the useful network to give a bad answer. The useful network will then learn not to give a bad answer, and the tricky network will try to trick the useful network again. As this continues, the useful network will get better and not become tricked as often, and the useful network will be able to be used to make good predictions.

Emergency Alert System

The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is a national warning system in the United States put into place on January 1, 1997 (approved by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in November 1994). 

It pops up on your TV, radio, or phone for example if a tornado comes it will be on the news, radio, or phone and when it is over the National Weather Service will send you another alert when you can come out. The most serious alert that can be given out over the EAS is an Emergency Action Notification or a Presidential Alert. When an EAN is issued, a voice will say the following whilst watching TV or listening to the radio; "We interrupt our programming. This is a national emergency." After the alert tone, the text to speech or a real human voice will give instructions on the emergency and provide instructions on what to do to stay safe, or if the world is coming to an end due to warfare or a global pandemic. There also may be additional messages given out from a representative of the President. An Emergency Action Termination message will be issued when the threat is over. Additionally, there will be a nationwide test of the EAS that takes place in the US once a year along with a new presidential alert system that works very similar to weather warnings that are issued on a cell phone. 
Emergency Alert Systems are also used worldwide in countries like Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and is ready to alert citizens on world ending events such as a nuclear war, a new global threat etc. 

Most recently, the United Kingdom government have been trialing mobile phone alerts with a service called Emergency Alerts that uses a similar sound to the WEA from the US which is the original attention signal used for the US Emergency Alert signaling a pattern.

Gambling addiction

A gambling addiction is when someone is obsessed with gambling despite the negative consequences. Gambling addictions often puts the person in risk of losing everything. People with this illness often think about suicide more than the general population. Many people use gambling as a way to get away from their terrible lives and to gain satisfaction. In many ways, gambling addiction is similar to other addictions (such as the addiction to alcohol or the addiction to illegal drugs).

Someone with a gambling addiction often

Gambling addiction is a serious disease difficult to overcome. In most cases, it is treated through therapy, support groups, medications and counseling. In some cases, specific drugs can help. There is no definite cure. 

Research demonstrates how the brain can get addicted to gambling. There is also evidence older people are more likely to become gambling addicts.

Recently, the problem of gambling has become extremely important due to the ubiquitous distribution of cash slot machines, the opening of many casinos, as well as bookmakers (including online). All of them are beautifully designed, which enhances the suggestive effect of an easy winning opportunity in a short time and a constant desire to recoup and win more. Slot machines have long been widespread throughout the world. 

In the United States, according to R. Volberg (1996), the number of “problem players” - addictive gamblers so dependent on slot machines that their lives are completely subordinated to this passion - reaches 5% of the population. Data from other researchers (Ladouceur et al., 1999) indicate that in the first half of the 1990s alone, the number of problem players in Canada increased by more than 75%.

Covid-19 impacted gambling significantly. 68% of actively engaged gamblers have spent more money online since lockdown began. These frequent online gamblers are already vulnerable to addiction, and their behaviour in 2020 has been seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. But, with 40% of the population experiencing a decrease in their disposable income, it’s possible that infrequent betters might look to online gambling as a quick solution for financial difficulty.

Receptacle (botany)

In biology and botany, the receptacle is the swollen basal part of the flower. It can also be made as the top of the stalk or pedicel. When the stalk of the plant, the part which connects flower to the plant, gets flattened and the other parts of the flower including the 4 whorls (calyx, corolla, androecium, gynoecium) start, that flattened part is called the receptacle. It is the end part of the stalk or pedicel.

In some fruits like a strawberry, it is the thing that becomes the main fleshy edible part of the fruit. The fruit species, rubus, has a conical receptacle with a cluster of seeds (droplets) on top of it.

When a raspberry is picked, the receptacle gets separated from it, but it is just the opposite case in blackberry where it remains attached. 

In phycology, they are the structures at the end of the branches of algae mainly brown algae. There, they act as specialized structures having reproductive organs and also help in storage.

Grenfell Tower fire

The Grenfell Tower fire started shortly before 1am BST on 14 June 2017 in a tall building or tower block, Grenfell Tower, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, West London, England. The fire killed 72 people. Grenfell Tower was built in 1974, and was used for housing people. The flats in the building were subsidized: meaning the government paid part or all of the of the people who lived there.

In the early hours of 14 June, 2017, a fire broke out in the building, which caused massive damage to nearly all of the building. The fire broke out around the 4th floor of the 23 floor building. It was signalled to police at 0:54 local time. The fire brigade took 6 minutes to get to the tower. In total, 70 fire engines, and more than 200 firefighters were trying to put out the fire. On the 14th of June, at the end of the day, the number of people injured (and taken to hospitals) was about eighty, about 20 were in a critical condition. About 72 people died in the fire. There could have been up to 600 people in the 120 one- and two-bedroom flats of the block at the time of the fire. The number of people that were in the building when the fire broke out is unknown; police have estimated around 200.

The fire started around 00:50 BST (UTC+1), when a fridge caught fire in flat 16 on 4th floor. Firefighters arrived around 1am, and put out the fire in the flat within minutes. When the crew were leaving the building, they spotted flames rising up the outside of the building. Images later presented to the Grenfell Tower Inquiry suggested that the fire may have reached the outside before the firefighters had begun to tackle the initial fire in flat 16. The flames spread up the side at a "terrifying rate", By 01:29, a rising column of flames had reached the roof and the fire was out of control.

Many people believe this rapid spread was due to the outside of the building, which had been changed recently. This cladding seemed to contain highly flammable material. Many residents complained about poor fire safety and other problems with the building, which was managed on behalf of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The residents' organisation, Grenfell Action Group, had repeatedly warned of major fire safety problems since 2013, and also noted past fires and fire-related incidents in similar blocks managed by the same company, which they felt were related to poor fire safeguards and management company fire policies. One of these policies told residents to stay in their flats in case of fire. The group warned in November 2016 that only a "catastrophic" fire would finally force the block's management to treat fire precautions and maintenance of fire-related systems to a proper standard.

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said there were "questions that have to be answered" about the fire-safety conditions at the Grenfell Tower. Khan criticised the safety instructions telling people to stay in their flats in particular:
"We can't have people's lives being put at risk because of bad advice or lack of maintenance." The advice of staying in the flat assumes that firefighters can contain the fire inside the building, which is impossible if it is spreading rapidly via its outside. The advice may have proved fatal to many people.

A team of 250 firefighters from forty fire engines attempted to control the fire and rescue people. The first emergency services arrived six minutes after the alarm, but the fire's very high temperature slowed rescue attempts. At 04:14, officials from the Metropolitan Police addressed the large crowd of onlookers and urgently told them to contact anyone they knew who was trapped in the building—if they are able to reach them via phone or social media—to tell them they must try to self-evacuate and not wait for the fire brigade. Firefighters entered the building to try to rescue people but reported they were hindered by the extreme heat. According to witnesses, there were people trapped inside, waving from windows for help, some holding children. There were two witness accounts of parents dropping their children down to people below, including a baby who was caught after being thrown from the ninth or tenth floor, and a small boy thrown from the fifth or sixth floor. There were also eyewitness reports that some people were jumping out. At least one person used knotted blankets to make a rope and escape from the burning building. Frequent explosions that were reported to be from gas lines in the building were heard.
Many residents of the tower were Muslims. Because of Ramadan, many were awake at the late hour. Many were able to alert residents and help them escape during the early stages of the fire, which saved many lives. For this, they were hailed as heroes.

After three hours, the original crew of firefighters were replaced. By sunrise, the firefighters were still battling the fire and trying to spray areas where people were seen trapped. The watching crowd were pushed back from the building because of falling debris. At 05:00, the building was still burning and severely damaged. The fire continued to burn on the tower's upper floors into the afternoon of 14 June. Firefighters were expecting to continue tackling the blaze for at least a further 24 hours. Although fears were expressed that the building could collapse, structural engineers determined that it was not in danger and that rescue teams could enter it to search for survivors, casualties and bodies.

The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. Several media outlets reported that it may have been caused by a faulty kitchen appliance. A fourth-floor resident told the media that it was his neighbour's fridge that caught fire around 1:00 am, and that they immediately began knocking on doors to alert people. He said that within half an hour the building was entirely engulfed in flames.

Whilst there was much criticism of the lack of fire sprinkler systems, Geoff Wilkinson, the building regulations columnist for the "Architects' Journal", wrote in a comment on 14 June, before the cause was known ("we should avoid speculating"), that if a leaking gas riser or the cladding were at fault, sprinklers would have had little effect. He said he had seen extracts of a fire risk assessment and talk of flammable material stored in the common walkways, suggesting poor overall management.

The inhabitants of the building organised the Grenfell Action Group, years ago. They regularly pointed out problems with the building. In 2013, they published part of a report, where they showed that the protection against fire was insufficient in the building. Regulations require that these materials are checked regularly. According to the 2013 report of action group, there had been no such checks in the three years before the report.

When a building is on fire, people need to be able to get out quickly. Usually, there are specially signalled escape lanes for this. The action group pointed out that the escape lanes were not free, and people often parked their cars in such a way that the police was unable to get close to the building.

There had been various repairs and renovations in the building, from 2014 to 2016. The company who was responsible for these works said that they were shocked, at what had happened, and that at the time the works had been done, regulations had been met.

When the building was renovated, the materials used for the outside of the building were changed. Fire safety experts have speculated that this new material was a possible cause of the rapid spread of the fire. They said it essentially worked like a chimney in spreading the fire. The material could be seen burning and melting, causing additional speculation that it was not fire resistant. One resident said, "The whole one side of the building was on fire. The cladding went up like a matchstick."

Records show that a contractor installed "over-cladding with ACM cassette rain screen" during the recent refurbishment at Grenfell Tower. The term ACM stands for aluminium composite material. With this kind of material, the choice of insulation core material determines how easily it can be burned. Several tower building fires have involved the same external materials, including the 2009 Lakanal House fire in Camberwell, London, the 2009 Beijing Television Cultural Center fire and the 2015 fire at The Marina Torch, Dubai. Sam Webb, the architect who investigated the Lakanal fire and who sits on the All Party Parliamentary Fire Safety & Rescue Group, said "This tragedy was entirely predictable, sadly."

The product used was Reynobond, which is available with different types of core material—polyethylene, as reportedly used in Grenfell Tower (Reynobond PE), or a more fire-resistant material (Reynobond FR). The Reynobond cladding reportedly cost £24 per square metre for the fireproof versions, and £22 for the flammable version. According to the BBC, the more fire-resistant version (Reynobond FR) is a very new product, and it is unclear whether it was available at the time the building was being clad.

According to the US-based manufacturer of Reynobond, the polyethylene version of the material is banned in the United States for use in buildings exceeding in height, because of the risk of spreading fire and smoke. The refurbishment also used an insulation foam product named Celotex RS5000, installed behind the cladding.
According to its datasheet, the polyisocyanurate product—charred pieces of which littered the area around Grenfell Tower after the fire—"will burn if exposed to a fire of sufficient heat and intensity".
The cladding at Grenfell seems to have been used to decorate other apartment blocks. People are concerned that the affected buildings may face the same problems.

Some residents had reported concern that the new cladding on the building was fixed onto it with wooden battens. There is widespread concern amongst residents and fire safety experts about the increasing use of timber, even in high-rise buildings, following a change to building regulations. It was reported that one reason for the new cladding was to improve the view for people living in the surrounding area.

Some residents said no fire alarms went off when the fire started. Residents said they were alerted to the fire only by people screaming for help or knocks on the door and not by a fire alarm. Others reported that they survived by ignoring the council's "stay put" policy, its directive instructing residents to remain in their flat in case of fire.

The London-wide Radical Housing Network, a citizens' action "group of groups... fighting for housing justice across London" of which the Grenfell Action Group is a member, said that the fire was "a horrific, preventable tragedy" that was the result of a "combination of government cuts, local authority mismanagement, and sheer contempt for council tenants and the homes they live in".

People in the immediate area and from across London rallied to assist victims of the fire. Donations of food, water, toys, and clothes were made. Saint Clement Church on Treadgold Street and St James' Church, Norlands, in the Deanery of Kensington, provided shelter for people evacuated from their homes, as did nearby mosques and temples.

Nearby Queens Park Rangers Football Club have offered their Loftus Road venue as a relief centre and are accepting donations of food, drink and clothing from the local community, and other nearby football clubs Brentford and Fulham have offered their stadiums as relief centres.

Jean Nicot

Jean Nicot, sieur de Villemain (born 1530 in Nîmes, died 1600 in Paris) was a French nobleman, and diplomat. He was the French ambassador in Lisbon, from 1559 to 1561. He also negotiated the marriage of princess Margaret of Valois, who was five years old at the time, with prince Sebastian of Portugal, who was six years old at the time.

When Nicot returned, he brought tobacco plants. He introduced snuff tobacco to the French royal court. In particular, he presented the queen mother, Catherine de' Medici, with tobacco leaves to cure her of her migraines. The plant was also an instant success with the Father Superior of Malta, who shared tobacco with all of his monks. More and more of the fashionable people of Paris began to use the plant, making Nicot a celebrity.At first, the plant was called Nicotina. But nicotine later came to refer specifically to the particular chemical in the plant. The tobacco plant, "Nicotiana", also a flowering garden plant, was named after him by Carl Linnaeus, as was nicotine. Nicot described its believed medicinal properties (1559) and sent it as a medicine to the French court.For his service to the French royal court, Nicot was given the name 'de Villemain' and land near Brie-Comte-Robert. There, he compiled one of the first French dictionaries, "Thresor de la langue françoyse tant ancienne que moderne" (published in 1606).

Subsidized housing

Subsidized housing is the idea to create housing opportunities (usually flats) for people who have trouble finding a flat on the free market. Usually, this means that there is a maximum . Very often, the government pays part (or all) of this rent. People who get the apartments or flats need to meet certain criteria.

2017 Congressional baseball shooting

On June 14, 2017, in Alexandria, Virginia, James Thomas Hodgkinson opened fire on several Republican members of Congress and their staffers, who were practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game scheduled for the next day. 

A ten-minute shootout ensued between Hodgkinson and officers from the Capitol Police and Alexandria Police. Hodgkinskon shot five people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R–LA) and two Capitol Police officers assigned to protect him; one of the officers shot Hodgkinson, who later died from his wounds. Police have not commented on his motivation.

Scalise was the first sitting member of Congress to have been shot since Arizona Representative Gabrielle Giffords was attacked in the 2011 Tucson shooting.

President Donald Trump issued a statement saying, "We are deeply saddened by this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress, their staffs, Capitol Police, first responders, and all others affected." Vice President Pence made similar comments.

Gheorghe Gușet

Gheorghe Guşet (28 May 1968 – 12 June 2017) was a Romanian shot putter. He competed at the 1992, 2000 and 2004 Olympics and had his best result in 2004, aged 36 (14th place). Guşet was noted for being competitive in his late 30s, and set his all-time personal record aged 38, while most shot putters peak in their late 20s or early 30s. Due to health problems (chronic kidney disease) he was forced to retire from competitions in 2008.

Guşet died on 12 June 2017 in Cluj Napoca, Romania from an aortic dissection at the age of 49.

Aortic dissection

Aortic dissection occurs when a tear in the inside of the aorta causes blood to flow between the layers of the wall of the aorta, forcing the layers apart. In most cases this is associated with a sudden onset of severe chest or back pain, often described as "tearing" in character. 

Also, vomiting, sweating, and lightheadedness may occur. Other symptoms may result from decreased blood supply to other organs such as stroke or mesenteric ischemia. Aortic dissection can quickly lead to death as a result of not enough blood flow to the heart or rupture of the aorta.

Aortic dissection is more common in those with a history of high blood pressure, a number of connective tissue diseases that affect blood vessel wall strength such as Marfan syndrome, a bicuspid aortic valve, and previous heart surgery.

Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma

Patricia Edwina Victoria Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma (14 February 1924 – 13 June 2017) was a British peeress and the third cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.

Knatchbull was the elder sister of Lady Pamela Hicks, and first cousin to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and the last surviving baptismal sponsor to Prince Charles, Prince of Wales.

Mountbatten succeeded her father when he was assassinated in 1979, as his peerages had been created by the Crown with special remainder to his daughters and their heirs male. This inheritance accorded her the title of "countess" and a seat in the House of Lords, where she remained until 1999, when the House of Lords Act 1999 removed most hereditary peers from the House.

Knatchbull died on 13 June 2017 in Kent, England at the age of 93.

Cladding

Cladding is placing one type of thing on top of another in a layer to make something like a skin. This can protect whatever is underneath the cladding from the weather, or it may make it look beautiful.

For example, Rainscreen cladding is one form of weather cladding. It protects things from rainwater and keeps it from getting too hot or cold. The cladding does not need to be waterproof. Some cladding only makes the rainwater or wind flow another way to control run-off. For example, rainscreen cladding can make water on a rooftop flow away from some parts of the building so the water does not come inside. Cladding may also stop noise. Cladding applied to windows is often referred to as window capping and is a specialized field.

During the 19th century Indian society had various social and religious problems in the Indian society. Several movements were started to help reform the society various "samajs" were formed. These included the Prathna Samaj, the Satya Shodhak Samaj, the Theosophical Society, and others. The Brahmo Samaj was one of these. It was founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy in the year 1828. It can also be said as the first attempt by the Indians to reform their religion and end its harmful practices. While under Keshab Chandra Sen it was able to make great progress and set up many branches across India. The Brahma Samaj helped reform the Indian society.

Some of its important reforms were to end the practice of sati (the widow committing suicide on her dead husband's funeral pyre), opposing the worship of many gods, ending costly sacrifices and meaningless rituals. The movement proposed the belief that God is omnipresent, promoted inter-caste and widow remarriage, opposed child marriage and polygamy, and more.

Deseret alphabet

The Deseret alphabet () is a writing system invented in the 19th Century in America by the Mormon Church. A group of leaders called the Board of Regents created it. They were from Brigham Young University.

Brigham Young wanted all letters to match sounds, to make reading and writing easier for immigrants. Teachers taught the alphabet in the school system at the time. 

Between 1854 and 1869, books, newspapers, street signs and mail used the new alphabet. Even though the LDS church tried very hard to support the alphabet, it wasn't continued for very long.

Church leaders Brigham Young, Parley P. Pratt and Heber C. Kimball were part of the Board of Regents that made the Deseret alphabet. Other important creators were George D. Watt and William W. Phelps.

Before they decided to use the Deseret alphabet, the Board of Regents thought they would use Pitman style alphabets. On 29 November 1853, they came together to vote. Then, Willard Richards, who was sick when the Board of Regents had talked about which alphabet to use, saw the Pitman style alphabet. He said it looked too much like the English alphabet, and he wanted to start over with something new. His words convinced Brigham Young and the rest of the Board of Regents to make the Deseret alphabet. Less than two months later, the Board of Regents approved the first 38-letter Deseret alphabet. 

In the Deseret alphabet, capital letters ("majuscule" or upper case) look the same as the lower case ("minuscule") letters, except the capital letters are larger. In the chart below, the "Glyph" is the letter shape, and next to it is the letter's name, which is how it sounds.

It happened on June 18, 2017 at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri. It was the eighth Money in the Bank and the first with a Money in the Bank ladder match for women. 

Seven matches were performed at Money in the Bank and one of them was on the pre-show. Baron Corbin won the last match which was the Money in the Bank ladder match. Also, Jinder Mahal beat Randy Orton so he would still hold the WWE Championship and Carmella cheated to win the first Money in the Bank ladder match for women. The event was also interesting because it was Mike Kanellis' first time ever in WWE and Maria Kenellis' first time in WWE since 2010.

Every Money in the Bank has had a Money in the Bank ladder match which has several wrestlers and you win by climbing a ladder and grabbing the briefcase held above the ring. The winner gets a match for a world championship whenever they want. Since this event only had wrestlers from "SmackDown", the winner would not get a match for "Raw"'s world championship which is called the WWE Universal Championship. Instead, the winner would get a match for SmackDown's world championship which is the WWE Championship.

On the May 23 episode of "SmackDown", Shane McMahon announced who he chose to be in the Money in the Bank ladder match. He chose A.J. Styles, Shinsuke Nakamura, Dolph Ziggler, Sami Zayn and Baron Corbin. But Kevin Owens was upset by this because he beat A.J. at Backlash and if A.J. is in the match, he should be too. Shane then decided to add Kevin to the match.
At Backlash, Jinder Mahal beat Randy Orton with help from the Singh Brothers and won his first WWE Championship. On the next episode of "SmackDown", Jinder had a celebration but usually when a champion loses their title, they get a rematch at the following PPV. Shane McMahon came down to the ring and it turned out, Randy had asked for a rematch which Shane gave him. 

On the May 23 episode of SmackDown, Charlotte Flair, Natalya, Tamina and Becky Lynch, one by one, asked "SmackDown"'s commissioner, Shane McMahon, for a match against Naomi for her WWE SmackDown Women's Championship. Shane decided to have a fatal 5-way match between the three of them where the winner would face Naomi at Money in the Bank. But before the match, the five starting brawling. So Shane came down to the ring and said he decided to have the first ever women's Money in the Bank ladder match where the winner would get a match for the SmackDown Women's Championship whenever they want.

A cerebral infarction is an area of necrotic tissue in the brain caused from a blockage or narrowing in the arteries supplying blood and oxygen to the brain.

Which arteries are problematic will determine which areas of the brain are affected (infarcted). These varying infarcts will produce different symptoms and outcomes. About one third will prove fatal.

In summer 1940 the Italians occupied the western areas of French Somaliland, while attacking southern France. The armistice stopped their advance. In early 1941 they withdrew from the areas occupied, because of the British attacks on Italian East Africa (Eritrea, Somalia & Ethiopia).

In June 1940 and until September 1940 the Italians did a series of attacks in Africa: one was in the "Cote Francaise des Somalis" (now called Djibouti). 
In June 1940 the French commander in Djibouti, Brigadier-General Paul Legentilhomme, had nearly 9,000 men in seven battalions of Senegalese and Somali infantry. Legentilhomme also had three batteries of field guns, four batteries of anti-aircraft guns, a company of 16 light Renault R35 tanks, four companies of militia and irregulars, two platoons of camel corps, and an assortment of 18 aircraft. 
The Italians had on the eastern border of their Italian Ethiopia -under the "Commander" General Guglielmo Nasi and with the support of the "Regia Aeronautica"- nearly 40,000 soldiers: the 40th Infantry Division Cacciatori d'Africa of General Giovanni Varda, the 65th Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia of general Amedeo Liberati and 6 colonial brigades supported by 4 tank companies (mainly Fiat L3/35 tankettes) and by one Armored Car Company with Fiat 611 "autoblindo". 
But only the Italian colonial troops (the brigades were made mainly of Eritrean Ascari) fought inside the French Somaliland, while the division "Cacciatori D'Africa" only entered southern coastal French Somalia during the August attack on British Zeila.
After Italy's declaration of war on France and Great Britain on June 10, there were in the following week some skirmishing between the French and Italians around the railroad connecting Addis Ababa to Djibouti: the nearby French fort of Ali-Sabieh was hit by Italian colonial troops. 
The invasion was started from Italian Ethiopia's Harrar Governorate, when colonial troops of general Guglielmo Nasi attacked the fort of Ali-Sabieh in the south and Daddato in the north. After some days of heavy fighting the french garrisons surrendered to the Italian colonial troops. There were initial skirmishes even in the area of Dagguirou and around the lakes Abhe & Ally. 
After the first week the Italian aviation started to attack: on 17 June some Italian IMAM Ro.37 aircraft undertook a reconnaissance of Djibouti, noting five or six warships in the port and about twenty aircraft at a nearby aerodrome. On 21 June eleven Caproni Ca.133s bombed Djibouti in the largest raid of the colony's brief war. Anti-aircraft fire was intense and two Italian aircraft failed to return, but fires and explosions were seen in Djibouti.
Overnight, several waves of Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bombers attacked the port facilities. On 22 June the Italians suspected the British might try to establish a forward base at Djibouti, and five Ro.37bis, four Fiat CR.42 and one Fiat CR.32 aircraft hit the airfield there. Some French Potez 25 reconnaissance aircraft bombed Italian installations at Dewele in retaliation.
The invasion was also done inside the ""Territorial waters"" of French Somaliland in the gulf of Tadjoura. Since the first week the Italian Navy sent two submarines ("Torricelli" & "Perla") to patrol the waters in front of Djibouti city, Tadjoura and Oblock.
The Armistice of Villa Incisa (previously written on June 24) requested officially on June 25 the "forced demilitarisation of Gibuti", according to articles 3, 5 and 9.
Finally between 1 and 10 July 1940 several clashes with the Italians took place again on the plain of Hanlé, at Ali-Sabieh and along the railroad. The border area of western French Somalia was occupied by Italian troops, who withdrew from Hanlé in October 1940 and only in March 1941 from Dagguirou.
Since July the Italians occupied nearly 1/4 of French Somaliland, but it was nearly all a semi-desert and depopulated region. Meanwhile, as a consequence of the problems about Legentilhomme withdrawal, the Italians reinforced their garrisons in Hanlé and Daggirou (also with the construction of a new road from Italian Eritrea). 
When Italian troops attacked British Somaliland in August 1940, they occupied the southern coast of the "Cote Francaise des Somalis": the 17th Colonial Brigade under Colonel Agosti occupied the French fort at Loyada on the border with British Somaliland. Later, when the Italian invasion of British Somaliland began on 3 August, the forces at Loyada moved on Zeila, which they conquered by 5 August.
Dagguirou (and all northern French Somaliland bordering Italian Eritrea) remained under Italian control until March 1941.

Relaxin

Relaxin is a peptide hormone.

Relaxin is produced in females. It rises to a peak about 14 days after ovulation, and then declines if the egg is not fertilised. During the first three months of pregnancy, levels rise and more relaxin is produced. Relaxin adjusts blood supply during pregnancy. It also relaxes pelvic ligaments. It softens the pubic symphysis (the ligaments joining the bottom of the pelvis).

In males, relaxin also has a function: it enhances motility of sperm in semen.

In animals, relaxin widens the pubic bone and facilitates labor. It also softens the cervix (cervical ripening), and relaxes the uterine musculature. Thus, for a long time, relaxin was looked at as a pregnancy hormone. However, its significance may reach much further. Relaxin affects collagen metabolism, inhibiting collagen synthesis and enhancing its breakdown.

Paradigm

In philosophy of science, a paradigm is a way of thinking about a problem. The word comes from Greek παράδειγμα ("paradeigma"), "pattern, example, sample" from the verb παραδείκνυμι ("paradeiknumi"), "exhibit, represent, expose" and that from παρά ("para"), "beside, beyond" and δείκνυμι ("deiknumi"), "to show, to point out". Paradigm can also be used to refer to a set of ideas about a given subject. The idea that the Earth is the center of the universe, or that the Earth and other planets move around the sun are examples of paradigms. One of the first modern people to use the word was Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799), an 18th century mathematician and scientist.

In rhetoric, paradeigma is known as a type of proof. The purpose of paradeigma is to provide an audience with an illustration of similar occurrences. This illustration is not meant to take the audience to a conclusion, however it is used to help guide them there. A personal accountant is a good comparison of paradeigma to explain how it is meant to guide the audience. It is not the job of a personal accountant to tell their client exactly what (and what not) to spend their money on, but to aid in guiding their client as to how money should be spent based on their financial goals. Anaximenes defined paradeigma as, "actions that have occurred previously and are similar to, or the opposite of, those which we are now discussing." Aristotle uses the word in a similar way, in inductive logic. usually, induction is used to get from a number of special cases to a general one. Aristotle uses the word to get from one special case to another.

The original Greek term "παράδειγμα" (paradeigma) was used in Greek texts such as Plato's Timaeus (28A) as the model or the pattern that the Demiurge (god) used to create the cosmos. The term had a technical meaning in the field of grammar: the 1900 "Merriam-Webster" dictionary defines its technical use only in the context of grammar or, in rhetoric, as a term for an illustrative parable or fable. In linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure used "paradigm" to refer to a class of elements with similarities.

Bruxism

Bruxism is the problem of too much tooth grinding or jaw clenching. It is not a normal use for teeth like eating or talking. Bruxism is a common problem that affects 8–31% of people. Bruxism can wear down teeth, make them too sensitive, and cause headaches and jaw pain. It can also harm dental work like crowns and fillings. Sometimes these problems are not noticed, so not everyone with bruxism knows they have it.

There are two main kinds of bruxism: sleep bruxism and awake bruxism. Sleep bruxism happens when the person sleeps, and awake bruxism happens when the person is awake. Symptoms of sleep bruxism are often worse when waking up. Awake bruxism can feel fine when waking up, then get worse as the day goes on. There may be many reasons why people grind their teeth and clench their jaws. Awake bruxism may have different causes from sleep bruxism. Females are more likely to have awake bruxism. Sleep bruxism affects males as often as females. Several treatments are used, but none are proved to be very effective.

Mohammed bin Salman

Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud (; born 31 August 1985) is the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, First Deputy Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia and the youngest minister of defense in the world. In September 2022, he was named Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia.

Mohammad is also chief of the House of Saud royal court, and chairman of the Council for Economic and Development Affairs. He has been described as the power behind the throne of his father, King Salman.

Mohammad was appointed Crown Prince in June 2017 following the decision from Muhammad bin Nayef to remove himself from all positions, making Mohammad heir apparent to the throne.

Mohammad's international image is complex. Some in the Western world sees him as a hope for modernization of Saudi Arabia, with ambitious plans for the kingdom, such as 2030 Vision, but at the same time as a human rights violator. On the foreign politics, Mohammad led the Saudi participation on the war in Yemen, and made closer relations with Russia, China and Iran.

On April 25 2016, bin Salman announced the launch of Vision 2030. The vision is a main part of Saudi Arabia's plan to ensure its economic growth for the upcoming decades, specifically reducing the oil as a main source of income, and encourage economic developments on diverse sectors. The vision was built around three primary aspects: a vibrant society, a thriving economy and an ambitious nation. 

As for a vibrant society, the 2030 Vision is about creating a society where the citizens are enjoying a good quality of life. Practically, to achieve this goal, the plan aims to improve the healthcare, education, and social services.

As for a thriving economy, the 2030 vision is willing to create a strong and growing economy for the kingdom. The plan aims to achieve this goal by diverse the economic sectors, investing in industries like tourism and technology.

As for an ambitious nation, the 2030 vision is about making Saudi Arabia an influences country on the world arena. The plan aims to achieve this by promoting Saudi Arabia as a global leader in areas like energy, finance, and culture, and by working with other countries to address global challenges.

Mohammad bin Salman believes Saudi Arabia should adopt a moderate version of the Islam. During a television speech on Ramadan, bin Salman justified his views towards the Islam saying the strict views of Islam in Saudi Arabia is a major obstacle to his plans for the modernization of Saudi Arabia, such as 2030 vision. bin Salman also supports holding events that were previously considered unacceptable, for example, live music performances, festival and sports competitions, such as Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, first held on 2021. 

Since 2017, hundreds of citizens have been arrested in the kingdom, including social networks influencers, journalists, clerics, and tycoons. In addition, few of bin Salman's cousins were arrested as well. 

In on May 2018, seven activists was arrested, including Eman al-Nafjan and Loujain al-Hathloul. Human Rights Watch claimed bin Salman is responsible for the arrests, and the target is spreading fear among those who criticizes bin Salman agendas. 

In October 2018, bin Salman received global outcry for being accused of having a role in the killing of "The Washington Post" journalist Jamal Khashoggi. bin Salman later interviewed to the American Television program 60 Minutes and denied the accusations. 

Mohammad bin Salman wants the Kingdom to play a bigger role in the region against the influence of Iran, the war in Yemen he started to show this power of Saudi Arabia. In September 2014 the Houthis conquered the Yemeni capital Sana’a, which led to President Hadi fleeing the country. The Saudis led the group of Arab states to bring Hadi back to power, as he had asked for help basing it on article 51 of the UN Charter and because the Houthis are close with Iran Saudi Arabia’s regional rival. The Arab group was led by Saudi Arabia and had as participants Egypt, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Sudan and Morocco, but only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are still very actively involved in the conflict.

The Saudis hoped that it would be a quick invasion but deeper into the land of the Houthis it showed that a quick victory for the coalition would not be the case. Under President Obama the US did support but not help the Arab states, under President Trump the US became more involved. While the ties between the Houthis and Iran was weak at the start of the invasion it became very strong as the war went on, and as Iran is the regional rival of Saudi Arabia stopping the conflict would mean an increase of power for Iran therefore the Saudis stay involved even though it is very costly. The group of nations is now divided with the Saudis bombing in the north of Yemen and the United Arab Emirates supporting group in the south of Yemen. As of 2023 peace talks between the Saudis and Houthis are happening and making progress.

Under bin Salman rule Saudi Arabia and Russia are allies in the OPEC+, Saudi Arabia is also investing in Russia, this also leads to better relations between the two. This relation has not changed since the 2022 conflict in Ukraine, with $500 million being invested in Gazprom, Rosneft and Lukoil after the conflict had already started even though western countries put sanctions on these companies.

When President Trump got to power the relations between the US and Saudi Arabia were bad, President Obama had pressured Saudi Arabia for diplomacy with Iran and to rely less on the US for defense. President Trump was just like bin Salman in its view of Iran as the greatest danger in the Middle East, and also disagreed with Obama’s policy in the Middle East. President Trump let other countries do their internal affairs without pressuring on human rights for example, which is convenient for bin Salman as human rights or not very good in Saudi Arabia. As President Trump saw Iran as the biggest danger in the Middle East he saw the Houthis as Iranian puppets and thus supported and assisted the Saudi invasion. President Trump also spread confusion about the CIA report on the killing of Kashoggi about him doubting if bin Salman really gave the order to kill and sold weapons to Saudi Arabia.

When President Biden was still campaigning for president he said he would treat the bin Salman as the pariah Biden called bin Salman because of the poor human rights situation, and the killing of journalist Kashoggi. One of President Biden's first acts as president was releasing the CIA report that blamed bin Salman of giving the order to kill Kashoggi, and before the report was published, President Biden called with King Salman saying he is the King and official leader of the country and not bin Salman, the Saudis rejected the report. Biden also paused the sale of ammunition to the Saudi Arabia further lowering relations with Saudi Arabia. In 2022 and 2023 the OPEC started producing less oil leading to negative reactions from the Biden administration.

The relations between Saudi Arabia and China are good as China is Saudi Arabia’s largest trading partner and with large investments such as an Aramco joint venture of $10 billion dollar and 35 other investments worth $28 billion in total. China did not blame Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of Khashoggi and for the human suffering in Yemen and Saudi Arabia stays silent or says China has the right to defend itself or to fight ‘terrorism’ as the way China treats its Muslim Uighur minority. That Saudi Arabia’s relation with China is good was also visible in the diplomatic deal that Saudi Arabia made with Iran in talks in China.

After the Iranian revolution in 1979, a rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran over the leadership over the Islamic world emerged, and after Iran tried to export revolution over the region Saudi Arabia feared a revolution. It led to a rivalry but in 2011 this rivalry became much harder as uprising in the region led to the two supporting opposite sides in conflicts. In 2016 after a Shi’ite cleric Sheik Nimr al-Nimr was executed by Saudi Arabia after demonstrations and the storming of the Saudi Embassy in Tehran by protesters, this led to the cut of diplomatic ties between the two. In 2023 an unexpected deal between the two was signed after diplomatic talks hosted by China, in which they would again open their embassies, bin Salman likely made this deal to support his Vision 2030 and the relation with Iran was an obstacle for foreign investment.

Euler–Mascheroni constant

In mathematics, Euler-Mascheroni constant is a number that appears in analysis and number theory. It first appeared in the work of Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the early 18th century. It is usually represented with the Greek letter formula_1 (gamma), although Euler used the letters C and O instead. 

It is not known yet whether the number is irrational (that is, cannot be written as a fraction with an integer numerator and denominator) or transcendental (that is, cannot be the solution of a polynomial with integer coefficients). The numerical value of formula_1 is about formula_3. Italian mathematician Lorenzo Mascheroni also worked with the number, and tried unsuccessfully to approximate the number to 32 decimal places, making mistakes on five digits.

It is significant because it links the divergent harmonic series with the natural logarithm. It is given by the limiting difference between the natural logarithm and the harmonic series:

It can also be written as an improper integral involving the floor function, a function which outputs the greatest integer less than or equal to a given number. 

The gamma constant is closely linked to the Gamma function, specifically its logarithmic derivative, the digamma function, which is defined as

For formula_7, this gives

Using properties of the digamma function, formula_1 can also be written as a limit.

Appeal to nature

An appeal to nature is an argument that says a thing is good "because" it is 'natural', or bad "because" it is 'unnatural'. It can be a bad argument for two reasons. First, not everyone agrees on what is "natural" or "unnatural". For example, eating meat is natural to some people and unnatural to others. Second, even if something is clearly natural or unnatural, that alone does not mean that the thing is good or bad. For example, many "natural" plants and animals are poisonous, but unnatural things like medicine and vaccines can be helpful against diseases. 

Some popular examples of the appeal to nature can be found on labels and advertisements for food, clothing, and health products. Labels may use the phrase "all-natural", to suggest that products are environmentally friendly and/or safe. However, a "natural" product may not be safe, environmentally friendly, or effective.
