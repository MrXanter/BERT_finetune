She is in relationships with three men: the polite and well-meaning Jamie Overstreet, the self-obsessed model Greer Childs and the immature Mars Blackmon.

Bootleg recording

A bootleg recording is an audio or video recording of a performance or song by an artist which was not officially released by the artist. The process of distributing or making such recordings is called bootlegging. 

Recordings may be copied and traded between fans of an artist without profit. But some bootleggers have sold recordings for profit. They sometimes add professional-quality sound engineering and/or packaging to the raw material.

Bootlegs are usually made of either unreleased studio recordings, live performances or interviews with a level of quality that can't be predicted.

Bootlegging dates back to the 16th and 17th centuries, around the time of William Shakespeare.

In the early 20th century, movie soundtracks were often bootlegged. One example was a bootleg of Judy Garland. She performed "Annie Get Your Gun". That was before Betty Hutton replaced her early in production. It happened after a full soundtrack had been recorded.

Bootlegging increased between the 1960s and 2000s. One of the most praised bootlegs in the 1980s is Prince's studio album "The Black Album". In December 1987, Prince ordered the album taken down because of a few advance copies being used to make bootlegs.

The rise in popularity of the video sharing website YouTube caused it to be a major carrier of bootleg recordings. Its owner, Google, believes that under the "safe harbor" rule of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), it cannot be held responsible for content. That allows bootleg media to be hosted on it without any fear of a lawsuit. In 2010 Youtube removed a 15-minute limit on videos. That allowed entire concerts to be uploaded by fans and bootleggers.

Freshwater fish

Freshwater fish are those that spend some or all of their lives in fresh water, such as rivers and lakes, with a salinity of less than 1.05%.

Freshwater fish differ from saltwater fish in several respects. Their gills must be able to diffuse dissolved gases while keeping the salts in the body fluids inside. Their scales reduce water diffusion through the skin: freshwater fish that have lost too many scales will die.

Freshwater fish also die from habitat destruction. Dams not only interrupt linear water flow and cause major geological channel shifts, but also limit the amount of water available to fishes in lakes, streams and rivers and have the potential to change the trophic structure because of these alterations of the habitat and the limitations to movement and connectivity.

The purpose of a dam is to impound (store) water, kill freshwater fish, wastewater or liquid borne materials for any of several reasons, such as flood control, human water supply, irrigation, livestock water supply, energy generation, containment of mine tailings, recreation, or pollution control.

Coolwater fish species prefer water temperature between the coldwater and the long warmwater species, around 60 to 80 °F (16–27 °C). They are found throughout North America except for the southern portions of the United States. Common coolwater species include muskellunge, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch.

About four in ten North American freshwater fish are endangered, according to a pan-North American study, the main cause being human pollution. Since 1989, the number of fish species and subspecies to become endangered has risen from 40 to 61.

In 1935 London, England, Michael Banks lives in his childhood home. He lives with his children Annabel, John and Georgie. His wife Kate died a year ago. For that reason, Ellen and Jane are helping him raise the children. However, Michael has taken out a loan from the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank to cover his expenses. William Weatherall Wilkins sends his partners to warn Michael that his house will be taken from him if he doesn't repay the loan by Friday. Michael and Jane remember their father left them shares in the bank that can cover the loan. They search the house for the certificate proving their ownership of the shares. During the search, Michael finds a kite. But there's no worth in it anymore, so he puts it out to give away.

While out in the park with Annabel and John, Georgie finds the kite and tries flying it. He ends up being pulled into the sky. He then comes down with Mary Poppins. She decides to take care of the three children as their nanny. She starts off by drawing them a bath. The bath leads down to an oceanic world. Mary Poppins denies anything in fantasy happened.

Michael goes to the bank to see if he can find proof of his shares. Wilkins, though, denies there are any records of them. Right after Michael leaves, Wilkins tears the record from the official book and burns it in the fireplace.

That evening, Annabel and John decide to sell their mother's "priceless" bowl to pay off the debt. But Georgie tries to stop them. The bowl ends up damaged because of the three fighting over it.

The next day, Mary Poppins and the children go and see Topsy so they can get the bowl fixed. But they find out that the bowl isn't worth much. They then head to the bank to give Michael his briefcase. When the children go to Wilkins' office to ask him for help, however, they learn he is planning to take away their house. Georgie interrupts the banker's meeting after seeing parallels between Wilkins, his associates and an animal gang who kidnapped him. When Michael arrives, he doesn't believe the children, and gets angry at them for putting the home and his job at risk. Mary Poppins takes the children home. They are guided by Jack and his fellow lamplighters.

The Banks family get ready to move out of their house. But as he looks at his old kite, Michael realizes that Georgie use parts of the shares certificate to cover the kite's holes. Michael and Jane head to the bank. Mary Poppins and the children go with Jack and the lamplighters to Big Ben to "turn back time". After scaling the clock tower, Jack and Mary turn Big Ben back five minutes. That gives Michael and Jane enough time to reach the bank. Michael and Jane reach the bank in time, though they're not successful in getting their shares because they do not have the part with the signatures on the certificates. But then, Mr. Dawes Jr. comes and expels Wilkins from the bank for corrupt practices.

The next day, the Banks family go to the park. They buy balloons that take them into the air. They're joined by Jack and many others, including Wilkins. But Wilkins' balloon falls to the ground. When they return home, Mary Poppins realizes it is time for her to go. Michael and Jane thank Mary as she flies back into the sky.

Hard copy and soft copy

The words "hard copy" and "soft copy" are about pages of words and pictures either recorded onto printed paper or in soft-copy form as shown and spoken in telephone or computer machine forms. Sometimes, a recording on a compact disc (CD) can be considered a hard copy of music, pictures or people talking.

In information handling, the U.S. Federal Standard 1037C (Glossary of Telecommunication Terms) defines a "hard copy" as a permanent reproduction, or copy, in the form of a physical object, of any media suitable for direct use by a person (in particular paper), of displayed or transmitted data. Examples of hard copy include teleprinter pages, continuous printed tapes, computer printouts, and radio photo prints. On the other hand, physical objects such as magnetic tapes, diskettes, or non-printed punched paper tapes are not defined as hard copy by 1037C.

A file which can be viewed on a screen without printing it out is known as a "soft copy". The U.S. Federal Standard 1037C defines "soft copy" as "a nonpermanent display image, for example, a cathode ray tube display."

The term "hard copy" predates the age of the digital computer. When making printed books and newspapers, hard copy refers to a manuscript or typewritten pages that have been edited and proofread and is ready for typesetting or being read on-air on the radio or television broadcast. This traditional meaning has been all but forgotten in the time of the information revolution.

Vibrio vulnificus

Vibrio vulnificus is a form of bacteria that can make people ill, as when eating bad clams or oysters, and more in people with a liver disease. "Vibrio vulnificus" is a species of Gram-negative, motile, curved rod-shaped (bacillus), pathogenic bacteria of the genus "Vibrio". Present in marine environments such as estuaries, brackish ponds, or coastal areas, "V. vulnificus" is related to ""V. cholerae"", as a bacteria which can give people cholera.

Infection with "V. vulnificus" leads to rapidly expanding cellulitis or sepsis. It was first isolated as a source of disease in 1976. The capsule, made of polysaccharides, is thought to protect against phagocytosis. The observed connection of the infection with liver disease (associated with increased serum iron) might be due to the capability of more virulent strains to capture iron bound to transferrin.

June Spencer

June Rosalind Brocksom CBE (née Spencer; born 14 June 1919) is an English retired actress. With a career spanning nearly eight decades, she is best known as the voice of Peggy Woolley in the BBC Radio 4 soap opera "The Archers".

Spencer made her debut in 1943. She was made an OBE in 1991 and a CBE in 2017. She turned 100 in 2019. She retired in 2022, at the age of 103, after 79 years in the industry.

June Rosalind Spencer was born at 30 Bingham Road in Sherwood, Nottingham, England on 14 June 1919, as the only child of Rosalind Mary Spencer (née Thorne; 1889–1984), a former nurse, and William Spencer (1890–1979), a salesman for Crawford's. She was baptised at St. John the Evangelist in Carrington, Nottingham on 3 August 1919. She lived in the home she was born at for the first seven years of her life.

Spencer attended Mountford House Preparatory School from 1924 to 1929. She studied part-time at the Stockwin Music College from 1931. She graduated from Nottingham High School for Girls in 1934, at the age of 15, after being told: "Of course you know you can't expect to get anywhere without your School Certificate" by Miss Philips, the headmistress. She was a member of the Brownies. She joined the St Mary's Amateur Dramatic Society in the Lace Market in 1942, where her drama teacher at the time was the producer. She later gained her London Guildhall School of Music and Drama certificate.

Spencer came second in a baby beauty competition while on holiday in Rhyl, Wales before she was two-years-old. She made her stage debut at the age of three, during a school performance of "King of the Land of Nod". She took piano lessons for 11 years, starting at the age of five. She later passed the Associated Board's Advanced Level. She wrote and produced plays in her back garden to raise money for charity from the age of 12. Her charity of choice was always Dr. Barnardo's.

Spencer was taught to drive by her father at the age of 12, while she was underage and uninsured. Her father also taught her how to drive through water. Her lessons came to an abrupt stop when her father discovered that one of his friends had been reprimanded for teaching his schoolboy son. She passed her official driving test the second time, having failed the first time for speeding.

Spencer had various boyfriends in her youth and often "played the field". She would make her parents answer the telephone, stating: "If it's Stuart or Bob, I'm in. If it's anyone else, I'm out." She met her future husband at a summer party, "including all my boyfriends".

Spencer began her career as a model, modeling teenage clothes in fashion shows for two local stores, earning "a few guineas". She also worked as a junior governess at a small private school, earning £40 per annum. She held a lecture on the importance of speech at the Nottingham Technical College, where her father lectured on salesmanship. She later lectured for two terms at the Mansfield Technical College, where her father had also lectured.

Spencer applied for auditions at the BBC's Midland region during the late summer of 1939, passing both her auditions for drama and review. World War II was declared shortly after and Midland region entertainment programmes closed. Her first paid work was performing monologues at Freemasons' dinners in 1938. Her earlier monologues were published in a book by Samuel French, which was used to train students at RADA. She was unaware of the books existence until much later in her career. Her war work included working at Nottingham City Treasurers Office. She also worked as a part-time elocution teacher.
Spencer reapplied four years later, passing both her auditions again. She made her official broadcasting debut in November 1943, when she was cast as a 12-year-old child in a 15-minute programme, "Railways in Wartime".

Spencer participated in the 1943 radio programme, "Home Town", where the wives of soldiers overseas could record a message to their husbands. Her husband was stationed in India at the time so she sent him a cryptic cable to give him the time and station. He successfully tuned in and heard his wife's message to him.

Spencer was contracted to complete a season in weekly rep theatre, with two shows a day for three guineas a week, as a reward for her debut performance. The arrangement broke down when she demanded a pay rise for taking the title role in a Christmas production of "Alice in Wonderland", with her boss suggesting that she should be grateful to have war work. She immediately quit, telling her boss: "I had rather fill shells than work for you, Mr Wright! You'll have my notice on Friday." Her first line on the professional stage was "What's your Will?" from "A Midsummer Night's Dream".

Spencer worked the telephone switchboards as a "Hello Girl", while volunteering with the Voluntary Entertainment company to perform in morale-raising shows for the forces in her spare time.

Spencer joined the cast of the BBC Home Service radio soap opera "The Archers" for the pilot episode on 29 May 1950, as the voice of Margaret "Peggy" Perkins (born 13 November 1924). Peggy was introduced as Jack Archer's "Londoner" wife at a New Year's party held at the Archers' home in the first episode broadcast on 1 January 1951. She left the serial in 1953 to raise her two children and the role of Peggy was recast to Thelma Rogers. She returned as Peggy in 1962. Peggy authored "Peggy Archer's Book of Recipes" (), a 64-page cookbook which was published by BBC Books on 1 January 1968. She voiced other characters including a Scottish maid and an Irish baker's assistant called Rita Flynn. She once played two of her characters in a single scene. She voiced Tony, as a child. She also Mrs Spenlowe on nine episodes between 1969 and 1973, billed under her married name, June Brocksom.

Spencer found out about her casting during the spring of 1950, when she was rehearsing a radio play in the Birmingham Studios and another actress posed the question: "You're going to be in "The Archers", aren't you?", she replied: "Am I? What are "The Archers"?". She did not have to audition for the role of Peggy as she was already contracted to the BBC to star in a string of other radio plays, stating: "My work was well-known". She was originally paid £12 for five episodes - as an experienced actress - while others were paid between £8 and £10. The original cast were put on 13-week contracts. She had publicly criticised the creator, Godfrey Baseley, as being a "very abrupt man" who could be "very dictatorial" and "thought he was God", adding: "I can't say he was greatly loved" and "He wasn't very popular but he knew what he was doing when he invented "The Archers"." Baseley had once theatres to sack her after she decided to not attend his party. She later recalled "barely having a free weekend" due to the demand of public appearances to promote the serial, stating: "I can remember on one occasion being flown down to Cornwall in a rather ancient plane which had been very loosely adapted for civilian use. When we got there, there was a very large gathering of the Women's Institute for women all over Cornwall. Such was the popularity of the programme, I was literally mobbed." She also said: "When "The Archers" started, there were only seven of us in that pilot episode. In the very first few weeks, those of us who could were doubling parts and my other major part was as the Irish Rita Flynn and she had a very different voice." She also said Peggy's voice was "very light and high in those days" while Rita's was "much darker and lower". 

Spencer was approached to join the BBC's Repertory Company but was forced to decline as it was not possible to accommodate rep and "The Archers" at the same time.

Spencer made her television debut in the 23 November 1956 episode of the BBC panel game show "Guilty Party", written by Edward J. Mason and Tony Shryane. She portrayed Joan Purdy.

Spencer appeared in approximately seven episodes of the BBC Television religious programme "Songs of Praise" between 1961 and 2010. Some of her episodes were filmed with "The Archers", in Menorca and at the churchyard in her back garden.

Spencer wrote a number of the "Odd Odes" which were performed by Cyril Fletcher in the BBC One satirical consumer affairs programme "That's Life!" between 1973 and 1981. Her monologues were later published in a book, "Odes and Oddities", by Reynolds & Co. Ltd.

Spencer wrote scripts, three of which were produced by Edward Livesey; "Man the Hunter", "The Vanities of Man" and "The Rivalry of Man".

Spencer - as Peggy - recorded episodes of "The Archers" at the Queen Mother's birthday pageant in the Horse Guards Parade in July 2000, and at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2003, where she received the Ambridge Rose. She admitted that she did not see herself portraying the role of Peggy as a long-term acting job, in many interviews given around the show's 60th anniversary in 2010. She had criticised the pay in 2011. She had urged for credits at the end of each episode in 2018. Peggy was revealed as the mystery cast member in Lynda Snell's production of "The Canterbury Tales," at the end of 2018. Peggy plays a magician. Her co-stars called for her to be made a Dame on 11 June 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she was 101 and particularly susceptible to the virus. Production was scrapped and the cast recorded episodes remotely from their homes until the end of 2020. She cut an "Archers"-themed cake with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall during a reception at Clarence House to celebrate the show's 70th anniversary on 7 December 2021.

Spencer had been approached by producers for "The Archers" in the early 2000s about shining a light on Alzheimer's disease by having her on-air husband, Jack Woolley, showing the symptoms and eventually being diagnosed. She said it was the best storyline she had worked on, stating: "When they were thinking of doing the Alzheimer's story, I was asked how I would feel, because my husband had Alzheimer's, and I said, 'I'm all in favour of it, let's bring it out into the open, it needs to be done.'  It was a rare moment when an actor could influence a storyline. I was called to a script conference, which was unprecedented. The writers and directors sat around the big table and asked me to talk about it – what was it like, when did you first discover it. So I just talked. When I finished, they gave me a round of applause. Prof Simon Lovestone (a specialist in the condition at King's College London) wrote that it was the truest depiction of Alzheimer's he had ever come across." "The Archers" won the Mental Health BAFTA for Jack and Peggy's Alzheimer's story at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards on 11 February 2007. She collected the award with Arnold Peters. She was praised by numerous Alzheimer's charities.

Spencer portrayed Marian Hennessy in the 2 November 2000 episode of the BBC One medical soap opera "Doctors". She initially turned down the role as she did not want to have to learn lines but agreed when she was told: "The character has had a stroke and can't speak." In the episode, her character was failed to be kissed by Christopher Timothy.

Spencer was the castaway on the 28 February 2010 episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme "Desert Island Discs". Her chosen music included the Hallelujah Chorus and Fred Astaire's ""Cheek to Cheek"", with her favourite being John Williams playing Rodrigo's "Concierto de Aranjuez", her chosen book was "Three Men in a Boat" by Jerome K. Jerome, and her luxury a Scrabble board. She was the subject on the 15 May 2011 episode of the BBC Radio 4 Extra programme "Desert Island Discs Revisited".

Spencer wrote her autobiography, "The Road to Ambridge: My Life, Peggy and The Archers" (), which was published by JR Books Ltd on 1 September 2010.

She later became aware that a copy of ""June Spencer's Monologues"" in Australia was offered £30 on eBay, which is more than the original publishers paid.

Spencer was awarded the lifetime achievement award for 63 years of service at the BBC Audio Drama Awards on 26 January 2014.

Spencer said one of her goals were to celebrate her 100th birthday while still performing, a feat which she achieved on 14 June 2019. Her first interview to mark the milestone was given to Martha Kearney on the BBC Radio 4 programme "Today" on 11 June. She said: "I want to continue for as long as I can turn in a decent performance — I wouldn't want to go downhill. But I'd like to turn 100 and still be in "The Archers". I'm afraid I can't wait to retire until Peggy's 100 because she's five years younger than me." 

Spencer made her departure from "The Archers" in the episode broadcast on 31 July 2022, after 63 years in the role of Peggy Woolley. Her final episode was aired during the omnibus edition on 7 August. In the episode broadcast on 8 August, her character's son and daughter-in-law reflected on Peggy's life and agreed that Peggy was "an extraordinary woman." She had appeared in over 19,343 episodes. She was the sole survivor from the original cast. She drove herself to and from her home in Leatherhead, Surrey and the BBC Birmingham recording studio on each recording day until her mid-90s, when she was then granted a company vehicle. She said: "I have degeneration of my spine, which makes me very bent, so it's difficult to stand at the microphone, though the studio manager really looks after me and there's always a chair for me while we're waiting. Sometimes, if Peggy has to stand at the end of a scene, I fake the sound of making the effort to get up." She had a custom studio built inside her Surrey home, which she recorded episodes from in her later years.

Spencer confirmed her retirement on 8 August, at the age of 103, after 79 years in the industry, stating: "In 1950, I helped to plant an acorn. It took root and in January 1951 it was planted out and called "The Archers". Over the years it has thrived and become a splendid great tree with many branches. But now this old branch, known as Peggy, has become weak and unsafe so I decided it was high time she 'boughed' out, so I have duly lopped her." She was the longest serving radio actress in the United Kingdom and the second longest soap opera actress in the world. She had made previous attempts to retire, stating: "I've been trying to retire for at least a year. They didn't want to lose her character. Every time I tried to stop, they gave me more episodes."

Spencer was the subject of an article written by her former "The Archers" co-star Graham Seed (Nigel Pargetter), which was published by "The Guardian" on 9 August. The headline read: "I was on "The Archers" with June Spencer. She didn't have to leave – she is only 103." In the article, Seed commanded her for her "remarkable strength and resilience."

Spencer made her final television appearance in the 29 October 2022 episode of the BBC documentary series, "How the BBC Began".

The couple got engaged with their banns being read in Armagh Cathedral, while he was on leave from serving in Northern Ireland, and were married in Nottingham, Nottinghamshire on 27 May 1942, by Bishop Neville Talbolt. He proposed by asking: "How would you feel about being married to a Second Lieutenant?", to which she replied: "I wouldn't mind if it was you". They adopted two children through the Surrey County Council; a son David, a dancer, in 1952, and a daughter Rosalind "Ros", a council worker, two-and-a-half years later. Her husband died from a stroke with complications from Alzheimer's disease on 26 May 2001, the day before their 59th wedding anniversary. He was 81. He was buried in the churchyard in her back garden. Her son died from a massive internal hemorrhage with complications from alcoholism in Nuremberg, Germany on 2 November 2006. He was 55.

Spencer founded a Scrabble club after her husband's death. She continued to drive until the age of 99, however, she did not drive in the dark or on motorways.

Spencer is a Christian. She said: "I'm not, sort of, deeply into religion, but I do have faith."

Spencer celebrated her 100th birthday on 14 June 2019. Speaking on her longevity, she said: "If you're born with a sense of humour, that's a good help. An awful lot depends on your outlook on life. You're born either with your glass half full or half empty. But with old age, all sorts of things wear out and you can't get yourself the spares!" She also said: "Obviously one's body deteriorates rapidly - I'm still on my feet, just. But apart from that I have the same outlook on life as I've always had. I'm an optimist. I enjoy life. I enjoy all the beautiful things that are still there for me."

Spencer had calls to be made a Dame in 2019.

Spencer was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1991 Birthday Honours by Queen Elizabeth II, for her services to performing arts.

Bajo Hondo Train Station (Roca Railway)

"For the Rosario Railroad station to Puerto Belgrano, see Bajo Hondo Train Station."

Bajo Hondo Train Station is a railway station, located in Bajo Hondo town, Coronel Rosales Municipality, in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

It is a small station of the branch belonging to the General Roca Railway, from the Tandil to the Bahía Blanca station. It does not provide passenger services.
The station was founded in 1891 by the British capital company. Although it had been founded as the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway (BAGS), it was almost immediately called the Ferrocarril del Sud. The Bajo Hondo station was one of the 504 active stations that the company had until its nationalization. During the presidency of General Juan Domingo Perón, that company was renamed General Roca Railroad until today.

The date of inauguration of this station also doubles as the birth date of the Bajo hondo town.

Since the privatizations of the state-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos in the 90's, the Bajo hondo train station stopped providing services to passengers.

The station is currently inactive.

The building at the station has a certain degree of deterioration, and is currently used as a private home.

Paso Mayor Train Station

Paso Mayor Train Station is a train station in the municipality of Coronel Rosales, in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Its construction was completed on December 19. Constructed a French company known as: "Compagnie de Chemins de Fer Rosario-Puerto Belgrano".

Paso Mayor is located approximately 40 kilometers from Bahía Blanca and owes its name to a pass through a River called "Sauce Grande" which the local people used to cross that River at the time when there was no bridge to cross the river. The station is one of those which were classified as "Prime stations" because of their provisions for more services than other stations. For example Paso Mayor provided services including but not limited to : Passengers, Telegraph, Cargo, Livestock... 

Originally, in this area there was a place combining both store and bar, locally known as "pulpería" which belonged to a man called Laporte. So the place was called "Pulpería de Laporte" meaning "Store and bar of Laporte" Because the same place offered Horse services, that is ; travellers could have their tired horses changed for Fresh ones, the same place at times was called "Posta" of Paso Mayor. ("Posta" is a place where travellers change their tired horses for Fresh ones). This place served as a place for rest and shopping centre for travellers and traders who came to buy Hides and Skins and Liquor (Gin).

With the introduction of the Railway line, the "Posta" suffered a severe blow as Wagons and Carriages replaced Horses. The Pulperia became a tiny supermarket.

The presence of the Railway line called for people to come and settle around the train station. As a result, the place became a busy small town. But following the withdrawal of the Railway services in the seventies(1970s), the people abandoned the place and until now, it is a ghost town. 

The station was never provided with electrical installation and the lighting was provided by wax candles or kerosene lamps..

The state of the buildings at the station in general is bad, has been vandalized several times.

The passage of this railway branch through sparsely populated areas, low productivity lands and the outbreak of the First World War in Europe, this French line will enter a chronic deficit that will pursue it until its last days. 

In 1977, the closure of a line section was ordered from the Bajo Hondo stations to Pringles (closing of the Paso Mayor station). In the 80 'it is in operation only until the station Timote by a great flood that destroyed kilometers of the tracks. 

Finally in the 90 'was awarded in its entirety to the company Ferroexpreso Pampeano S.A. that is still the concessionaire of said branch.

Paso Mayor

Paso Mayor is a place located 40 km from Punta Alta and 50 km from the city of Bahía Blanca,in the municipality of Coronel Rosales, Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

According to several historians, many hundred thousands years ago, at this place was the only point possible for both humans and animals to cross the Grande River. In the 19th century, when the measurements, plans and divisions of the area lands began to be made, the people began to call this pass "Paso del Mayor Iturra", meaning " The pass of Mayor Iturra". Iturra was the Mayor of that area at the time. Iturra used this pass while grazing his cows, and the people while referring to it, they could say " the pass that Mayor Iturra use" later became the "Pass of Mayor Iturra" and finally shortened to " Pass of the Mayor". To present date, that name still exists in the documents of the place. Today, that point of the River acts as the natural limit / boundary of the of two municipalities of Coronel Rosales and Coronel Pringles.

From the history of the place we can mention the "Posta Paso Mayor" which was a place where travellers could have their tired horses changed for Fresh ones. This place was owned by one local man called Laporte. He also owned a "Pulperia" a kind of supermarket which majored in selling Hides and Skins as well as Liquor. This "Posta" and "Pulperia" with the arrival of the railroad were greatly affected, since the Wagons and Carriages replaced the Horses. and with transportation made easy, trading of Hides and Skins also moved to another level. The "Pulperia became a grocery store until it finally closed in the 30's.

Although it is a place where today there are very few inhabitants, once in its golden age, it reached more than 200 inhabitants. currently it does not exceed 20 people (INDEC, 2010).

It is predominantly agricultural being the optimal land for the cultivation of wheat, soy and sorghum in addition to the breeding of cattle and piggery.

Born on October 2, 1887 between the villages of Las Oscuras and Paso Mayor, Violet Jessop the "unsinkable" daughter of Irish parents is part of a group of settlers who founded the "English Colony of Sauce Grande" by the year 1868, which at that time belonged to Bahía Blanca, the place now belongs to the municipality of Coronel Rosales.

After the death of her father in 1903 the whole family decided to go to London (Great Britain) where they could have more luck than they had lived here, in Argentina.

In September 1910, she entered as a waitress the prestigious naval company "White Star Line" famous for being the owner of the most luxurious transatlantic ships of the time. Two years later she was part of the crew of the largest and most luxurious boat of the time the RMS "Titanic", which sank on the first trip. She was among the few survivors.

With the outbreak of the Great War, another ship, the transatlantic HMHS "Britannic", Sister ship of the "Titanic", was put at the service of the British Navy as a hospital ship, Violet Jessop having done a nursing course, board the ship as one of the aid tours, but on November 21, 1916 the ship collided with a German mine and sunk in less than an hour. She was again rescued alive.

She was in England when she retired, bought a small farm and was dedicated to raising animals. She always remembered her childhood and the land that saw her born, Argentina, as "My People".

Within its limits you can find several sites of interest to highlight that make Paso Mayor a place to know and discover.

Petra

Petra (Arabic: البتراء, "Al-Batrāʾ"; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα) is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. 

It is in a basin among the mountains that run from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.

Petra is believed to have been settled as early as 9,000 BC. It became the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who used Petra because it was near the spice trade routes.

The Nabataean Kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire in the first century BC. In 106 AD they lost their independence. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes developed. Also, an earthquake in 363 AD destroyed many structures. 

The Byzantine Era led to the construction of several Christian churches, but the city continued to decline. By the early Islamic era only a handful of nomads lived in Petra. It stayed unknown to the world until it was rediscovered in 1812 by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.

Petra is one of the seven new wonders of the world. Petra has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has described it as "one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage". 

Petra is Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Tourist numbers peaked to half a million in the first quarter of 2019.

The climacoceratids, named after one of their members, "Climacoceras", were previously placed in the family Palaeomerycidae, then in Giraffidae. In 1978, W.D. Hamilton made a new family, placing it near Giraffidae in the superfamily Giraffoidea.

They differ from giraffes as their ossicones are from different bones.

The Seven Bridges of Paso Mayor

The Seven Bridges of Paso Mayor is a railway bridge belonging to the Rosario Puerto Belgrano Railroad, which crosses the course of the Sauce Grande River in the limits of the Coronel Rosales and Coronel Pringles Municipalities, south of the Buenos Aires Province, Argentina.

It gets its name for being a bridge divided into seven sections, six of a type structure "cage" and one "open". It is in the Paso Mayor of the River Sauce Grande. Its was built in 1908. It is part of the Rosario Puerto Belgrano Railroad, which crosses from north to south, the south of the Santa Fe Province and all the west of the Buenos Aires Province.

It was used by a railway for the last time in 1977 when the southern section of that railway branch was closed by a decree of the military government.

In the 90 this railway line was leased to the company Ferro Expreso Pampeano S.A..

The supports of each end are 266 meters each. Each has two wings. Each one of the boards of each section rests on six pillars that are in what was the bed of the formerly mighty river.

The entire structure of the bridge, both the "upper rope", "lower rope", "diagonal", "lower bracing", "upper bracing", "poles", "joists", "bolts" and other parts of the bridges were built according to the following generalities:


In 2010 the Deliberative Council of the Coronel Rosales Municipality declared it "Architectural, Historical and Cultural Heritage". In 2012 it was declared a provincial historical heritage by the legislature of the Buenos Aires Province.

Despite being recently declared historical heritage, it was left without one of its sections, the one used by Ferro Expreso Pampeano (Fepsa) to replace the damaged one in the Province of Santa Fe that crossed on Route 18 south of Rosario. The National Transportation Regulatory Commission demanded that Fepsa "refrain from carrying out any operation that is not authorized by the competent authority to change all or part of the bridge." Days later, with the withdrawal of the already completed structure, the control body reiterated the request for restitution of the railway material before 30 days and threatened to initiate legal actions.

Finally the bridge was restored to the original place ending the controversy.

Khas Rajput

Khas Rajput (Devanagari: खस राजपूत) is a Rajput (warrior-ruler) community among Khas people. The term is popularly denoted to Khas people who follow Hindu tradition in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It is used very less in Nepal and is replaced by the term Chhetri.

They have been connected to the Khasas mentioned in the ancient Hindu literature. Historian Bal Krishna Sharma and Dor Bahadur Bista speculates that the Khas people were of Indo-European origin. Historian Baburam Acharya speculates that Khas are a sub-clan of Aiḍa, an Arya clan originated at Idavritt (modern day Kashmir). Khas were living in the Idavaritt in the 3rd millennium B.C.E. and the original meaning of the term Khas was Raja or Kshatriya (Yoddha). He further speculates that Kashmir has been named from its local residents Khas as Khasmir. In the 2nd millennium B.C.E., one group of Khas migrated towards Iran while the other group migrated east of Sutlej river settling only in the hill regions up to Bheri River. Historian Balkrishna Pokhrel contends that Khas were not the Vedic Aryans but Aryans of latter period like the Gurjara, Darada, Shaka, Pallava and Pisacha. He further asserts that post-Vedic Aryans were akin to Vedic Aryans in terms of language and culture.

Traditionally, the Khas people were divided into "Khas Brahmins" (also called Bahuns in Nepal) and "Khas Rajputs" (also called Chhetris in Nepal). In Garhwal regions of Uttarakhand in India, the Khas Brahmins and Khas Rajputs had a lower social status than the other Brahmins and Rajputs. However, in present-day western Nepal, and in Uttarakhand they had the same status as the other Brahmins and Rajputs, possibly as a result of their political power in the Khasa Malla kingdom. 

Khas Rajputs in Kumaon region of Uttarakhand are historically accepted as army recruits for the hill Rajas. In Uttarakhand, Gharwal region there are two general divisions of Rajputs - Asal Rajput and Khas Rajput. Asal Rajput are the immigrants of the lowlands of India while Khas Rajput are children of the local Khas population. Now there is no such divisions

Vowel length

Vowel length is a feature in languages when how long a vowel is spoken in a word can create a completely different word. Although this is a feature in many languages like Japanese, Arabic, Hawaiian, Classical Latin, and Thai, there are also many languages that do not have this feature. 

An example of this would be the Japanese words "chizu", which has a short vowel (a vowel spoken for a short time), and "chīzu", which has a long vowel (a vowel spoken for a long time). The only difference that can be heard is how long the vowel "I" is spoken. The amount of time the vowel is spoken could create two entirely different words. "Chizu" means "map", while "chīzu" "cheese". 

When using IPA, the colon (:) is used to show that the vowel before it is a long vowel. For example, "chizu" in IPA is written as /t͡ɕizɯ/, but "chīzu" is written as /t͡ɕi:zɯ/.

While Old English had vowel lengthening, most modern dialects of English do not. For example, the words "God" and "good" used to have the same vowel sound, but the vowel in "good ("/go:d/), which was a long vowel, was said longer than it was in "God" ("/"god"/)", which was a short vowel. Although the vowel sounds in Modern English are very different than in Old English, readers can often get an idea of how vowels used to sound like based on an English word's spelling, which often shows words' historical roots rather than their current pronunciation. Long vowels in Old English could be written with a bar on top of the vowel like in "gōd" (good)"." Later, during the days of Middle English, spellings used to spell long vowels included spelling with two vowels together like in "book" or "break" and putting a silent "E" at the end of the word like in "hate". These vowels were all long vowels until the Great Vowel Shift in English, in which the vowel sounds in English changed to sound very differently from before.

Classical Latin had both vowel and consonant lengthening, and long vowels had a macron, or a straight horizontal line, written above them. In Classical Latin, "ānus ("/ˈaː.nus/), "annus ("/ˈan.nus/), and "anus" (/ˈa.nus/) were all different words. "Ānus" means "buttocks", "annus" means year, and "anus" means old woman. Today, none of the Romance languages, the languages that are daughter languages of Latin, can distinguish words by vowel length, though Italian can distinguish words by consonant length: /anno/ "year", /ano/ "anus". Italian also has vowel lengthening in accented syllables ending in a vowel, but vowel length cannot make the difference between two words as it could in Latin. 

Great Vowel Shift

The Great Vowel Shift (GVS) - named so by Danish linguist Otto Jespersen - was a period of shifts in the pronunciation of vowels the English language. It took place approximately from the 15 century (the late Middle English period) until the 18 century (the Early Modern English period). This is the main reason why English words often sound different from how they are spelled.

Furthermore, coinciding with the development of print, the Great Vowel Shift and the increasing production of printed materials have brought about the standardisation of the English language as we know it today. 

This change was often divided into two phases (with a following third period in Early Modern English with less critical, minor changes) and varied slightly throughout English dialects. It concerned long vowels, short vowels and diphthongs and from the 1400s continued for several centuries. Some consonants’ pronunciation changes as well and these changes are sometimes described by scholars when discussing the Great Vowel Shift.

During the period of Middle English, there were five short and seven long vowels. Through the GVS, the long vowels "/i:/" and "/u:/" gained counterparts they did not have before, restoring the balance in the vowel system. This attempt to achieve balance is thought to be one of the reasons for the start of the GVS. Along with other theories, like the pull-chain and the push-chain theories. 


The change of pronunciation during the GVS affected long stressed vowels. Therefore, "“y”" in "“only”" didn’t change pronunciation because it is not stressed. But the same vowel changes pronunciation in the word "“my”" because it is stressed. The place of pronunciation in the mouth changes, it shifted so that is was pronounced in a higher place in the mouth. 

It is important to note that distinguishing the Middle English pronunciation is just an approximation done by scholars because there aren’t any recordings of spoken language from that period.


Most generally, the researchers of the GVS have divided it into two phases, which coincidentally correspond with the periods of writings of the two famous English writers: Geoffrey Chaucer and William Shakespeare. Consequently, Chaucer’s and Shakespeare’s writings are often employed as the most representative examples of the Great Vowel Shift’s changes.

The exact pinpointing of the period of the Great Vowel Shift and the reason for its occurrence remains unknown to this day. However, there are several theories which are the most frequent, the most widely accepted, and also interconnected through the notions of social emancipation and elitism.


Sound change

A sound change in a language is when the sounds of the language become different over time in historical linguistics. Since people of different languages or dialects often talk to each other, the way people talk becomes more like the way the others talk. Because of this, it is natural for languages to sound differently overtime. Sometimes it happens slowly, while in other times it happens quickly.

An example of a sound change in English is the Great Vowel Shift, when all of the long vowel sounds in Middle English changed into what they are today. This is why the way English is spelled is so differently from how it is spoken. 

Spelling systems that do not change with the sound changes of a language are often more difficult for a learner to learn how to read in that language. These kinds of spellings are called fossilized spellings. These include spelling systems like English, French, Mongolian script, and Thai. All of these spelling systems have changed little for the past few hundred years, even though their spoken languages sound very different from how they used to sound. Spelling systems that change with the sound changes are often easier for a learner to learn how to read. These languages include Japanese, Turkish, and German.

Another much smaller sound shift in many dialects of English is the cot-caught merger, where words with lower back vowels like in "cot" and "caught" sound exactly the same to native speakers of certain English dialects and are spoken without any difference between the two sounds.

Mongolian script

Mongolian script was the first writing system to be used to write the Mongolian language. It is similar to the Arabic alphabet in that it is a cursive writing system, or a writing system where all the letters in a word always touch each other and change depending on if the letter is at the beginning, middle, or end of a word. It is a vertically written system, meaning that it is written top-to-bottom, and it is the only vertical writing system to be read left-to-right (all other vertical systems, like Chinese and Korean, are left-to-right). It is one of the two writing systems used to write the Mongolian language, alongside Cyrillic, in the independent country of Mongolia (which is sometimes called Outer Mongolia to distinguish it from Inner Mongolia) and the only writing system used to write the language in the Chinese autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. Unlike Arabic, and Old Uyghur, the Traditional Mongolian script and it's variants are an abugida and brahmic script. It is also used to write several other Mongolic and Tungustic languages such as Buryat, Kalmyk, Oirat, Manchu, and Xibe.

It is believed that the reason why Mongolian script is vertical is so that it could easily be written on the neck of a horse, which horses were a very important part of Mongolian culture. In the year 1208, Genghis Khan captured a Uighur scribe named Tatar-Tonga and forced him to make the alphabet of his native language, the Old Uyghr alphabet, be used to write the Mongolian language. It did not fit the Mongolian language well, and it was difficult to learn even for native Mongolian speakers.

In 1941, a few decades after Mongolia became a communist state, the Cyrillic alphabet replaced Mongolian script likely due to influence from their communist ally, the Soviet Union. After the fall of communism, Mongolia made Mongolian script official alongside Cyrillic to revive Mongolian culture. However, Cyrillic is still more common due to the lack of education in Mongolian writing, the lack of money to support it, and the difficulty of typing Mongolian on a computer. Also, more Mongolians can read Cyrillic than Mongolian script. In Inner Mongolia, on the other hand, most ethnic Mongols do not know Cyrillic and can only read Mongolian in the Mongolian script.

Autonomous regions of China

Autonomous regions of China are areas with very large numbers of ethnic minorities living in them. Their local government is similar to a province, but unlike provinces, minority languages are often co-official alongside the Chinese language, and some laws are written to meet the needs of the minority groups. China's five autonomous regions are the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (East Turkestan), and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Their shortened names are Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Ningxia respectively. The largest minority group in each region are the Zhuang, the Mongol, the Tibetan, the Uighur, and the Hui people respectively.

Manchu language

The Manchu language is a Tungustic language and it was the native language of the Manchu people before and during the Qing dynasty. The Manchus are the ethnic minority in China that overthrew the Ming dynasty in 1644 and took over the country. When they ruled, they formed the Qing dynasty. Manchu uses a version of the Mongolian script that was changed to better suit the language. For the first 200 years, it was the official language in the courts, although commoners still spoke Chinese. However, during the mid-1800s, it became more common for the Manchu nobles to speak Chinese as their first language. As a matter of fact, China's last emperor, Aisin Gioro Puyi, knew very little Manchu and spoke Chinese as his first language. Nonetheless, Manchu was still written alongside Chinese in official documents until the end of Imperial China. Even though China today has 10 million Manchus, only 20 people speak Manchu today. This makes Manchu a critically endangered language. Almost all Manchus today speak Mandarin Chinese as their first language.

The game was considered a precursor to the popular arcade basketball game "NBA Jam".

OpenVPN

OpenVPN is a Virtual private network protocol that is open-source. This means the source code is openly available for anyone to access and develop. It creates secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities.

An active community has formed around the OpenVPN project, which has kept it up-to-date and provided regular security audits to ensure it’s viability.

It is particularly known for its security and privacy as well as its adjustability.

OpenVPN typically works on any port and has five encryption algorithms to such as SSL, IPSec or SSH. AES 256-bit encryption is the best security and privacy as it is essentially unbreakable. A TCP 443 port will make a connection similar to an https connection. It is essentially a secure connection which can help prevent website blocking and bypass censorship.

For greater speed, it is recommended to use UDP ports, using the default, Blowfish-128 cipher. This isn’t the absolute highest level of security, but for most people, it will suffice and will operate significantly faster than AES 256 on TCP.

Islam in Europe

Islam is the second-largest and fastest-growing religion in Europe. Most Muslim communities in Europe formed recently, but certain areas on the Balkans have a long Muslim history.

Islam entered southern Europe through the invading "Moors" of North Africa in the 8th–10th centuries. Many kingdoms and duchies in Spain, Portugal, Southern Italy and Malta have existed for centuries. After a series of conflicts and wars known as the Reconquista, these areas became Christian. Islam expanded into the Caucasus through the Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century. The Ottoman Empire expanded into southeastern Europe; it conquered large parts of the Byzantine Empire in the 14th and 15th centuries. Later, the power of the Ottoman empire faded, and it lost most of its territories in Europe. It collapsed in 1922. The countries of the Balkans still have large populations of native Muslims. Many of these Muslims have become secular.

The term "Muslim Europe" is used for the Muslim-majority countries of Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Transcontinental countries, such as Turkey, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have large Muslim populations, as does Russia in the North Caucasus.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, large numbers of Muslims immigrated to Western Europe. By 2010, an estimated 44 million Muslims were living in Europe (6%), including an estimated 19 million in the EU (3.8%). They are projected to be 8% by 2030. They are often the subject of intense discussion and political controversy created by events such as terrorist attacks, the cartoons affair in Denmark, debates over Islamic dress, and ongoing support for populist right-wing parties that view Muslims as a threat to European culture. Such events have also fueled growing debate regarding the topic of Islamophobia, attitudes toward Muslims and the populist right.

The country where most Muslims live in western Europe today is France, where they account for 12.5% of the population. In the European Union, Bulgaria probably has the largest Muslim population, about 15 % of Bulgarians said they were Muslims.

The most important clinically are doxorubicin and daunorubicin. They act to inhibit cellular processes around DNA metabolism which results in the death of rapidly dividing cells. Most anthracyclines are administered directly into the blood. Common side effects include decreased immune cell production, nausea, vomiting and hair loss.

Research continues around new anthracycline variants and formulation with several clinical trials currently underway around the world.

Zenzizenzic is a condensed form of the Italian censo di censo, used by Leonardo of Pisa in his famous book "Liber Abaci" of 1202.

Edith Humphrey

Edith Ellen Humphrey (11 September 1875 – 25 February 1978) was an inorganic chemist. She was probably the first woman from Britain to get a doctorate in chemistry.

Edith Humphrey's father, John, was a clerk (secretary). Her mother, Louisa, was a teacher. John Humprey was poor when he was a child and wanted all his sons and daughters to get an education. Edith's two older sisters were teachers. One of her brothers was an inventor.

Humphrey went to North London Collegiate School, one of the first girls' schools in the UK to teach science. From 1893 to 1897 Humphrey studied chemistry and physics at Bedford College, London. When she finished her degree she went to do a PhD (doctorate) at the University of Zurich.

On 17 October 1898, Humphrey entered the University of Zurich. Her supervisor, Alfred Werner, found that Humphrey was talented, and made her his assistant. Humphrey worked hard, and was disappointed by the social life.

Humphrey was Werner's first student to successfully prepare a type of compound that were very important in his development and proof of his coordination theory. One of these compounds, the cis-bis(ethylenediamine)dinitrocobalt(III) bromide, was the first creation of a chiral octahedral cobalt complex.

Pacers–Pistons brawl

The Pacers–Pistons brawl was a violent fight. It took place at a National Basketball Association (NBA) game between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons on November 19, 2004. It happened at the Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The Associated Press called it "the most infamous brawl in NBA history." The media called it "the worst night in NBA history."

With 45.9 seconds left in the game, Pistons center Ben Wallace went up for a layup. He was fouled by Pacers small forward Ron Artest. Wallace was mad for being fouled when the game had been already decided. He pushed Artest. A fight took place on the court between several players. When the fight was broken up, a fan threw a drink at Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table. Artest then went after the fan. That caused a massive fight between players and spectators. The fight went from the seats to the court. It lasted several minutes.

After the game, the NBA didn't allow nine NBA players a total of 146 games. That led to $11 million in salaries being lost by the players.

Ron Artest, Jermaine O'Neal, Ben Wallace and Stephen Jackson were taken from NBA basketball playing for a time on November 20, 2004.

Artest was taken from NBA basketball playing for the rest of the 2004–05 season. He lost almost $5 million in salary. Jermaine O'Neal also lost more than $4 million for his part in the fights. The players who were removed lost a total of $11 million in salary.

Venezuelan presidential crisis

Between 2019 and 2023 Venezuela experienced a Presidential crisis, with unclear leadership and terms of Presidency.

Despite encouragement to resign as president when his first term expired on 10 January 2019, Nicolás Maduro inaugurated himself. This resulted in widespread condemnation. The National Assembly invoked a State of emergency. Nations removed their embassies from Venezuela. With their belief that his election was illegitimate, they claimed that by retaking power, Maduro was converting Venezuela into an illegal "de facto" dictatorship.

Juan Guaidó, the newly appointed President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, began motions to form a transitional government as soon as he took the National Assembly role on 5 January 2019. Whether Maduro took office on the 10th or not, the country would not have a legitimately elected president. On behalf of the National Assembly, he became one of the first to denounce Maduro taking office, saying that the country had fallen into a "de facto" dictatorship and had no leader, and that they were in a state of emergency.

Maduro's government said that the crisis was a ""coup d'état" led by the United States to remove him from power and control the country's oil reserves."

2019 Gabonese coup d'état attempt

On 7 January 2019, the Armed Forces of Gabon announced a coup d'état in Gabon. Military officers claimed that they had removed President Ali Bongo. Bongo became president in 2016 after a disputed election and protests.

Ali Bongo was receiving medical treatment in Morocco. While he was there, armed rebels in the capital city Libreville acted. They took hostages. They said that they had created a "National Restoration Council" to "restore democracy in Gabon." 

During this time, the Internet was sometimes not available. It is unknown if the Internet was shut down by the rebels themselves or by civilians. Gabon's government later said that it had gotten control again.

Juan Guaidó

Juan Gerardo Guaidó Márquez (born 28 July 1983) is a Venezuelan engineer and politician. He is the President of the National Assembly of Venezuela and was a member of the Popular Will political party. He is a representative for the state of Vargas.

The Constitution of Venezuela lets the President of the National Assembly hold the role of Interim President of Venezuela if nobody else can have it. Guaidó took oath on 23 January 2019 to be interim president, because people rejected Nicolás Maduro as the president. Many countries recognize Guaidó as president, but others don't.

Guaidó grew up with a large family, who were middle-class but humble. His parents were an airline pilot and a teacher. One of his grandfathers was a sergeant of the Venezuelan National Guard, the other grandfather was a captain in the Venezuelan Navy.

He survived the 1999 Vargas tragedy which left his family temporarily homeless. He earned his high school diploma in 2000. The tragedy may have influenced his political views, he did not think that Hugo Chávez's government helped his family afterwards.

Guaidó has an undergraduate degree in industrial engineering. He was awarded this in 2007 at Andrés Bello Catholic University. He has two postgraduate degrees related to business, one from George Washington University in the United States, and the other from the Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administración in Caracas.

He is married to Fabiana Rosales, a journalist, and they have a daughter named Miranda.

Guaidó was part of a student-led political movement that was set up to protest about an independent television network RCTV not being able to operate any more due to the government. He helped set up the movement when he was 23. This was also the year he graduated from Andrés Bello. The group protested other government acts, including the 2007 constitutional referendum, which Chávez lost.

Two years later, in 2009, Guaidó helped set up a political party, the Popular Will party. He is a member of this party. In 2014, he was the party's national coordinator. CNN says that he was "mentored for years" by Leopoldo López, a more famous member of Popular Will. Guaidó and López talk to each other a lot, even though López cannot leave his house. Guaidó was well known to other people in Popular Will, but was not famous to other people until 2019, when López said he should be leader of Popular Will.

In the 2010 Venezuelan parliamentary election, Guaidó was elected as a back-up representative. In 2015 he was elected to be the main representative, with 26% of the vote. He represents an area that used to not support his party.

Even though he wasn't very famous, Guaidó stopped eating as a protest so that there would be elections in 2015. In 2017 he took an important communications job in the National Assembly. In 2018, he became the person in charge of the National Assembly, because he was named the head of the biggest alliance in the National Assembly. He helped out by telling stories to people at the University of Arizona, who were looking at the conditions of politicians in Latin America.

In the National Assembly, Guaidó looked into the staff of Maduro being corrupt, and worked with outside people to take back money that had been stolen from the Venezuelan public. He took part in the 2017 Venezuelan protests. He has a scar on his neck after he was shot with rubber bullets.

Guaidó was elected President of the National Assembly of Venezuela in December 2018. He was sworn in on 5 January 2019. Relatives of other politicians who have been locked up were invited to the inauguration, where they stood on the balcony behind the banner of Juan Requesens. Guaidó is the youngest person to lead the opposition. When he was officially in the job, he said he would stand up to Nicolás Maduro, and gave an eight-point action plan to do that. The plan, which the National Assembly agrees with, has three phases and eight key points:


On 15 January 2019, the National Assembly made a plan to work with other countries. They asked these other countries to not let Maduro access his money or money that belongs to Venezuela. Guaidó wrote an article on 15 January 2019 in "The Washington Post". In his article he told people about the problems in Venezuela and how he can fix it. Guaidó spoke to the "Wall Street Journal" about his methods to lead people, where he says people should be "holding out a hand". He said that he would not lock up members of the army who stopped helping Maduro and helped him instead. Other country leaders nearby to Venezuela asked Maduro to not become president again in 2019, wanting a better election.

Guaidó was taken to prison for 45 minutes on 13 January 2019 by the Venezuelan secret police. The Lima Group and the person in charge of the Organization of American States (OAS), Luis Almagro, said that Guaidó being arrested was wrong. Maduro said the people who locked him up had not been told to do that by anyone official. Twelve of the people who did it were arrested for disobeying orders.

Guaidó said that the soldiers disobeying showed that Maduro was not in control.

Article 233 of the Constitution of Venezuela says that there are situations when the president of the National Assembly can take the job of president of Venezuela, if there is no other president. Lots of people thought that Maduro had not been elected in a way that paid attention to other rules in the Constitution, and so Guaidó could become the president. Guaidó agreed on 10 January 2019 and said that he would try to become president. The National Assembly asked for people to protest on 23 January. This is an important day in Venezuela, because it is on this day that they got rid of an old president who was a dictator. Lots of people all over the world protested on the day. Guaidó said that he was president. Maduro was not happy about this, blaming it on the United States (U.S.). Maduro said he would not deal with the U.S. The U.S., Canada, and several Latin American countries gave their support to Guaidó to be interim president on the same day; Russia, China, Iran, Syria, Cuba and Turkey supported Maduro. On 29 January, the TSJ began investigating Guaidó, stopping him from having his money or leaving the country.
The day after becoming the interim president, Guaidó asked for help for the people of Venezuela. The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave him $20 million.

On 25 January, Guaidó made an Amnesty Law, which the National Assembly agreed with. It would help the National Assembly by supporting military personnel and authorities who help him.

He suggested that if Maduro gives up power, he may receive amnesty. In his first weekend as interim president, he held another public assembly, asking supporters to spread the word of the Amnesty Law throughout the country to military, police and other people it may affect.
Guaidó asked the Bank of England and British Prime Minister Theresa May to not give Maduro any of £1.2 billion of gold that belongs to Venezuela. He asked for them to give access to the gold to the opposition instead. In the same week, the US Treasury made sanctions to prevent US purchases from PDVSA (Venezuela's state-run oil company), and gave Guaidó control of some Venezuelan things in the country.

Carlos Vecchio was made the ambassador to the US for Guaidó's government. Gustavo Tarre Briceño was named by Guaidó as Venezuela's Permanent Representative to the Organization of American States. The National Assembly approved eleven diplomatic appointments on 29 January, including as ambassador to Colombia and Elisa Trotta Gamus as ambassador to Argentina.

In January 2019 Guaidó was recognized as the interim president of Venezuela by many individual nations in the Americas and around the world, and rejected by others, including the Chinese, Turkish, and Russian governments and the pro-Maduro Supreme Tribunal of Justice. The Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela in exile welcomed him as interim president.

The European Union did not say whether they recognized Guaidó as president of Venezuela, but did say on 23 January 2019 that it "fully supports the National Assembly as the democratically elected institution whose powers need to be restored and respected", adding that "the civil rights, freedom and safety of all members of the National Assembly, including its President, Juan Guaidó, need to be observed and fully respected". On 26 January 2019, Spain, France, Germany and the United Kingdom gave Maduro an eight-day ultimatum, saying they would recognize Juan Guaido as president unless Maduro calls for elections within those eight days.

The Organization of American States (OAS) made a decision on 10 January 2019 "to not recognize the legitimacy of Nicolas Maduro's new term". Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the OAS, recognized Guaidó on 23 January. In a special meeting of the OAS on 24 January, sixteen countries, including the US, recognized Guaidó as president, but they did not achieve the majority needed for a resolution.

"Time" magazine described Guaidó as charismatic, saying that he had "unified a divided opposition". He is known for "building unity among fellow legislators", according to a Bloomberg article. Michael Shifter said that he "has tried to reach out to the military, tried to unify the opposition and tried to reach Chavista folks as well". Guaidó is described by fellow politician Freddy Guevara as humble, sincere, a fighter, and "eternal optimist", and David Smolansky says that he "was incredibly brave [to challenge Maduro]". Vox interviewed an expert on Venezuelan politics who said that Guaidó was "uncharismatic", and compared him to former US President Barack Obama, saying they were similar at public addresses. "The Guardian" noted that Guaidó has adopted the same "rallying cry" as Obama's "Yes we can": "Sí, se puede!". An article in "The Nation" calls Guaidó a "second-string politician" who "simply declared himself acting president" in a brazen power grab. "The Guardian" reported concerns that Guaidó was allied with far-right leaders, Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro and the United States' Donald Trump.

In January 2019, within minutes of Venezuela's state-run media posting a video attempting to discredit Guaidó, the Instagram hashtag #guaidochallenge went viral, trending worldwide.

Passive-aggressive behaviour

Passive-aggressive behaviour is "indirect" aggression that pretends to be innocent. This means someone pretends to be nice, but is actually being mean. It can happen when people do what others want to stop direct confrontation, but they do not agree with what is ordered or suggested. A passive-aggressive person tries to hide their anger. For example, "I would have had a good day if I hadn't been cleaning up someone's mess". This sounds okay when someone first reads it, but it is actually them being mad at the person who made the mess.

This is not a psychological problem. It is just a way of behaving. In the workplace it occurs when people do not want to do what the employer wants them to do. The behaviour was first defined during World War II. Men were not openly defiant. They used "passive measures, such as pouting, stubbornness, procrastination, inefficiency, and passive obstructionism" to show their feelings. Examples of passive-aggressive behavior might include avoiding direct or clear communication, evading problems, fear of intimacy or competition, making excuses, blaming others, obstructionism, playing the victim, feigning compliance with requests, sarcasm, backhanded compliments, and hiding anger.

Extreme cases may become psychiatric problems. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders revision IV (DSM-IV) says passive-aggressive personality disorder is a "pervasive pattern of negativistic attitudes and passive resistance to demands for adequate performance in social and occupational situations".

Pneumodesmus

Pneumodesmus newmani is a species of millipede that lived during the late Wenlock epoch of the Silurian period around . 

It is the first myriapod fossil, and the oldest known creature to have lived on land. The single specimen was discovered in 2004 near Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire. 

The fossil of "P. newmani" was found by Mike Newman. He is a bus driver and amateur palaeontologist from Aberdeen. The fossil was in a layer of sandstone rocks on the foreshore of Cowie, near Stonehaven. The species was later called ""newmani"" in honour of its finder. The fossil is kept in National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh. 

In the photograph above, you can see the back is covered with hard plates, and wispy slender legs. The animal is definitely segmented, and it is like, or related to, millipedes.

Its cuticle has what look like openings or spiracles. These are part of a gas exchange system that would work in air. So "P. newmani" is thought to be the earliest documented arthropod with a tracheal system, and the first known oxygen-breathing animal on land.

"The Nizam's funeral procession was the biggest non-religious, non-political meeting of people in the history of India till that date."

Millions of people of all religions from different parts of the state entered Hyderabad in trains, buses and bullocks for a last glimpse of their king in a coffin in the King Kothi Palace Camp in Hyderabad. The crowd was so uncontrollable that barricades were installed alongside the road to enable people to move in a queue. D. Bhaskara Rao, chief curator, of the Nizam's Museum stated that an estimated one million (1 million) people were part of the procession.

Murder of Dru Sjodin

Dru Katrina Sjodin (September 26, 1981 – November 22, 2003) was an American murder victim. She was kidnapped from the Columbia Mall parking lot in Grand Forks, North Dakota by Alfonso Rodriguez Jr on November 22, 2003. Her kidnapping and murder caused the creation of the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Registry.

At 4:00 pm Saturday, November 22, 2003, Sjodin, a 22-year-old college student at the University of North Dakota, finished her job shift at the Victoria's Secret store at the Columbia Mall in Grand Forks. Sjodin shopped for and bought a new purse from Marshall Field's. She then left the mall and began walking to her 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass. During this time, Sjodin was speaking to her boyfriend, Chris Lang, on her cell phone. Ten minutes into the call, Lang reports Sjodin said "Okay, okay" before the call ended.

Just over a week later, on December 1, 2003, 50-year-old registered sex offender Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. was arrested in connection with Sjodin's disappearance. Sjodin's body was found on April 17, 2004, just west of Crookston, Minnesota when deep snow drifts began to melt.

Crookston is also where Rodriguez had been living with his mother. Sjodin's body was found partially nude and face down in a ravine. Her hands were tied behind her back. She had been beaten, sexually assaulted and stabbed. She had several lacerations, including a five-and-a-half-inch cut near her neck. A rope was tied around her neck.

Thousands of people had helped search for the young woman. Hundreds went to her funeral.

The trial of Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. was held in federal court because Sjodin was taken across state lines. This meant he was eligible for the death penalty if he was found guilty. But neither North Dakota nor Minnesota have the death penalty. 

On August 30, 2006, Rodriguez was found guilty of sexual assault, kidnapping and murder in Sjodin's death. On September 22, 2006, Rodriguez was sentenced to death.

Memoization

Memoization (or memoisation) is a technique from computer programming to optimize a computer program. Computer programs call functions. Each function calculates a result it will return. Memoization is simple: before the value is returned from the function call, it is stored in a table (or associative array). Like a cache, this array will only be able to store a limited number of results. The function can then be changed so it tries to look up the value of the input in its lookup table. This lookup is much less expensive than doing the calculation again. Also like a cache: the data table will be cleaned periodically, for examples the values that have not been lookued up for a given time are removed.

Although related to caching, memoization refers to a specific case of this optimization, distinguishing it from forms of caching such as or page replacement. In the context of some logic programming languages, memoization is also known as ; see also lookup table.

Susannah Martin

Susannah Martin (baptized September 30, 1621 – July 19, 1692) — born Susannah North — was one of fourteen women executed for witchcraft during the Salem witch trials of colonial Massachusetts.

The English-born Martin was the fourth daughter, and youngest child, of Richard North and Joan North (née Bartram). Her mother died when she was a child. Her stepmother was Ursula North. Martin was baptized in Olney, Buckinghamshire, England on 30 September 1621. Her family moved to Salisbury, Massachusetts around 1639 when she was about 18 years old.

On August 11, 1646 at Salisbury, Susannah married a widower George Martin, a blacksmith with whom she had eight children, including a daughter Jane, a great-great-great-great grandmother of United States President Chester A. Arthur.

In 1669, Susannah was first formally accused of witchcraft by William Sargent, Jr. In turn, George Martin sued Sargent for two counts of slander against Susannah, one for accusing her of being a witch, and another for claiming one of her sons was a bastard and another was her "imp". Martin withdrew the second count, but the Court upheld the accusation of witchcraft. A higher court later dismissed the witchcraft charges.

By 1671, the Martin family was again involved in legal proceedings dealing with the matter of Ursula North's inheritance, most of which Ursula had left to her granddaughter, Mary Jones Winsley. The court sided against Susannah and George, although Susannah was able to bring five further appeals, each being decided against her. 

George died in 1686, leaving Susannah an impoverished widow by the time of the second accusation of witchcraft in 1692. Inhabitants of nearby Salem Village, including Joseph and Jarvis Ring, had named Susannah a witch and stated she had attempted to recruit them into witchcraft. She was also accused by John Allen of Salsbury, a man who claimed that she had bewitched his oxen and drove them into the river nearby where they later drowned. She was tried for these charges, during which process she proved by all accounts to be pious and quoted the Bible freely, something a witch was said incapable of doing. Cotton Mather countered Susannah's defense by stating in effect that the Devil's servants were capable of putting on a show of perfect innocence and Godliness.

Susannah Martin was found guilty, and hanged on July 19, 1692 in Salem. Some interesting excerpts from the transcript of Susannah's trial are below: (spelling, punctuation, capitalization as original)To the Marshall of the County of Essex or his lawful Deputies or to the Constable of Amesbury: You are in their Majesties names hereby required forthwith or as soon as may be to apprehend and bring Susanna Mertin of Amesbury in þ county of Esses Widdow at þ house of Lt. Nathaniel Ingersolls in Salem village in order to her examination Relating to high suspicion of sundry acts of Witchcraft donne or committed by her upon þ bodies of Mary Walcot, Abigail Williams, Ann Putnam, and Mercy Lewis of Salem village or farms whereby great hurt and damage hath been donne to þ bodies of said persons... etc.At the preliminary trial for the crime of "Witchcraft and sorcery" Susanna pleaded not guilty. The original court record book has been lost, but the local Puritan minister, Cotton Mather, recorded the testimony. Susanna and the others accused were not allowed to have counsel.As soon as she came in, Marcy had fits
Magistrate: Do you know this woman?
Abigail Williams saith it is goody Martin, she hath hurt me often.
Others by fits were hindered from speaking.
Marcy Lewis pointed at her and fell into a little fit.
Ann Putnam threw her glove in a fit at her.

... Susanna laughed ...
Magistrate: What! Do you laugh at it?
Martin: Well I may at such folly.
Mag: Is this folly? The hurt of persons?
Martin: I never hurt man or woman or child.
Marcy: She hath hurt me a great many times and pulls me down. 
Then Martin laughed again.Susannah Martin was twice forced to submit to physical examination for evidence of a "witch's tit or physical protuberance which might give milk to a familiar." No such deformity was found in Susannah Martin but it was noted that "in the morning her nipples were found to be full as if the milk would come", but by late afternoon "her breasts were slack, as if milk had already been given to someone or something." This was an indication that she had been visited by a witch's familiar, and was clear evidence of guilt.

Lone Tree Hill, a famous historical site, bore a tablet on its westerly side marking the site of George and Susannah's home. The boulder which marked their homestead has been moved to make room for a highway, and it can be found on the map where the highway crosses Martin Road in Amesbury. The marker lies nearby. George was one of the largest landowners in Amesbury. The inscription on the marker reads: "Here stood the house of Susannah Martin. An honest, hardworking Christian woman accused of being a witch and executed at Salem, July 19, 1692. She will be missed! A Martyr of Superstition. T.I.A. 1894." 

In the 19th century, poet John Greenleaf Whittier composed "The Witch's Daughter" about Martin.

On Aug 29, 1957 the State of Massachusetts voted to wipe from the books the convictions of six women that had been unjustly accused of being witches 265 years earlier. Then Gov. Foster Furcolo signed the legislative intended to clear Susannah Martin, as well as: Ann Pudeator, Bridget Bishop, Alice Parker, Margaret Scott and Wilmot Redd. All had been convicted in a colonial court and hanged during the 17th century.

However, while taking a graduate course on Salem witchcraft during the late 1990s, Paula Keene discovered that, although the legislators intended to pardon all six of the women in 1957, only Ann Pudeater's name was listed on the official documents. Susannah Martin, Bridget Bishop, Alice Parker, Margaret Scott and Wilmot Redd were simply listed as "five others convicted of witchcraft." Keene and state representative Michael Ruane worked together to redress the issue.

On Halloween 2001, due to Keene and Ruane's efforts, as well as the efforts of many of the descendants of the accused witches, Susannah Martin, Bridget Bishop, Alice Parker, Margaret Scott and Wilmot Redd were finally, and truly exonerated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Descendants of Susannah Martin’s, Ethel Mae Hilton and grandchildren Douglas and Madrey Margaret Hilton were the only members of their family interested in the history of their accused witch ancestor.

Kirsten Gillibrand 2020 presidential campaign

Kirsten Gillibrand, the junior Senator from New York, began on March 17, 2019 with her formal announcement in Troy, New York and ended when she failed to qualify for the third primary debate on August 28, 2019.

In January 2019, she announced the formation of an exploratory committee to think about running for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election. She made the announcement on January 15, 2019, in an appearance on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert". The campaign accepted donations from individuals and refuses political action committee donations.

Her view on guns clearly changed after the 2012 school shooting. It is reported that the pro-gun organization changed from "we like her" to "we hate her". After the announcement, she fights against that pro-gun organization directly by a tweet. She says mass shootings is a real national emergency.

In a Twitter video post on March 17, 2019, Gillibrand announced that she was officially running for president.

After failing to qualify for the third debate in September, Gillibrand ended her campaign on August 28, 2019.

He said this was less hazardous to the environment. 
Dr. Rocks is Professor Emeritus of Chemistry at Long Island University. He has appeared on television on the subjects of elbow injury for baseball pitchers. Dr. Rocks did research on the effect temperature has on a baseball. Rocks found that the optimal bounce of a baseball lies between 68-75 degrees Fahrenheit because at lower temperatures the elastomeres become more rigid and become softer at higher temperatures. 
Dr. Rocks defined his concept of "sports chemistry" as "the combination of modern analytical chemistry with sports metrics".

Rocks has done extensive research on how sports chemistry relates to music. He called his research, "molecular rhythm to life," when he appeared on Fox Sports Midwest. He said, "There are body rhythms that will one day be understood for the mind."

"Topps" featured Dr. Rocks on the back of the 2018 "future stars" series baseball card of MLB player Paul DeJong.

Plastic waste

Plastic waste describes plastic objects which have not been recycled or disposed of properly, or have been illegally dumped. Between one and eight million tons of plastic waste enters the Earth's oceans every year, and the World Economic Forum predicts this will double by 2030 if no action is taken. Thin plastic objects such as plastic bags and litter can be blown away by rainwater and wind into rivers and drains. This can cause drainage problems on land and pollution at sea. Birds and sea turtles can often mistake these plastic bags for jellyfish or other forms of food. Fish and marine mammals also eat thousands of tons of plastic waste each year. Some countries banned plastic drinking straws in response to a video showing a turtle with a straw stuck up its nose. Sea turtles are not the only animals effected. Plastic waste also poses a threat to other forms of marine life, such as seabirds, fish, and marine mammals, as they can become entangled in them, or ingest these pieces of plastic, resulting in suffocation or starvation. Paper straws are a proposed alternative as they break down after a long time in seawater.

Nets for catching different insects have different mesh sizes, with less space between the threads. Fishing nets usually have bigger, more 'open' mesh. Catching small aquatic creatures usually requires an insect net. The mesh is smaller and can capture more forms of animals.

Urethral sponge

The urethral sponge is a spongy cushion of tissue, found in the lower genital area of females, that sits against both the pubic bone and the vaginal wall, and is around the urethra.

The urethral sponge is made of erectile tissue; during arousal, it becomes swollen with blood, and squeezes the urethra, helping to stop urination during sexual activity (along with the pubococcygeus muscle).

Also, the urethral sponge has the Skene's glands, which might be used in female ejaculation.

The urethral sponge is around sensitive nerve endings, and can be stimulated through the front wall of the vagina. Some women have had strong pleasure from stimulation of the urethral sponge, but others have found the feeling to be not good, as irritating. The urethral sponge is around the clitoral nerve, and since the two are so closely inter-connected, stimulation of the clitoris may stimulate the nerve endings of the urethral sponge and vice versa. Some women enjoy the rear-entry position of sexual intercourse for this reason, because the penis is often angled slightly downward and can stimulate the front wall of the vagina, and then also the urethral sponge.

The urethral sponge is an area in which the G-spot (Gräfenberg Spot) may be found. Although the G-spot may exist, it has been doubted by some researchers. A team at The King's College of London, in a big study on the G-spot's existence in recent years, and having 1,800 women, found no proof that the G-spot exists. The authors of the study had stated that the "G-spot" may be a figment (thought) of people's imagination, which has been encouraged by magazines, sex therapists and suggestive therapeutics. However, some other studies, using ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women who report having orgasms during intercourse.

The name in Chinese means "fish fragrance". However, it contains no seafood and is typically not added to seafood. There is a legend after the meaning of the name. The sauce was used regularly by a mother to cook freshwater fish for her family. However, there was once the family have no fish. The mother then took the leftover sauce to flavour meats and everyone liked the dish. This is the reason it got its name YuXiang or fish flavored. Cooking Yuxiang normally involves the use of sugar, vinegar, doubanjiang, soy sauce, and pickled chili peppers.
The ingredients of yuxiang are finely minced pao la jiao (pickled chili), white scallion, ginger, and garlic. They are mixed in more-or-less equal portions. Some people prefer more scallions than ginger and garlic.The mixture is then fried in oil until fragrant. Water, starch, sugar, and vinegar are then added to create a basic sauce.

The sauce is used most often for dishes containing beef, pork, or chicken. It is sometimes used for vegetarian recipes. Barbara Tropp suggests in a book called "The Modern Art of Chinese Cooking" that Yuxiang can also be mean "Sichuan-Hunan" flavor. Dishes that use yuxiang as the main seasoning have the term (yuxiang) placed in front of the name of the dish. 

Some examples are as follows:

Among the large firms not included in the term are Herbert Smith, Lovells, Norton Rose and Stephenson Harwood, which are less profitable.

Arguably, for this reason, it was not included in the initial Magic Circle.

Know-Nothing Party

The American Party, commonly known as the Know-Nothing Party, was an American nativist political party that operated in the mid-1850s. It was originally anti-Catholic, prejudiced against other nationalities, and against immigration. The movement was briefly a major political party in the form of the American Party. Followers of the movement were to reply "I know nothing" when asked about its specifics by outsiders, thus giving the group its most common name.

The Know-Nothings believed a "Romanist" conspiracy was in progress, trying to undermine the power and authority of civil and religious liberty in the United States and wanted to politically organize native-born Protestants in a defense of their traditional religious and political values. It is remembered for this theme because of fears by Protestants that Catholic priests and bishops would control a large amount of voters. In most places, Know-Nothingism lasted only a year or two before disintegrating because of weak local leaders, few publicly declared national leaders and a deep split over the issue of slavery. In the South, the party did not focus on anti-Catholicism, but was the main alternative to the dominant Democratic Party.

The collapse of the Whig Party after the Kansas–Nebraska Act passed left an opening for a new major party to oppose the Democrats. The Know-Nothings elected congressman Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts and many others in the 1854 elections and created a new party known as the American Party. Particularly in the South, the American Party served as a party for politicians who disagreed with the Democratic Party. Many also hoped that it would seek a middle ground between the pro-slavery positions of many Democratic politicians and the anti-slavery positions of the emerging Republican Party. The American Party nominated former President Millard Fillmore in the 1856 presidential election, although he kept quiet about his membership. Fillmore received 21.5% of the popular vote in the 1856 presidential election, finishing behind the Democratic and Republican candidates.

The party quickly declined after the 1856 election. The 1857 "Dred Scott v. Sandford" decision further aroused opposition to slavery in the North, where many Know Nothings joined the Republicans. Most of the remaining members of the party supported the Constitutional Union Party in the 1860 presidential election.

Pete Buttigieg 2020 presidential campaign

On January 23, 2019, Pete Buttigieg, then-mayor of South Bend, Indiana, announced the formation of an exploratory committee to run for President of the United States in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He formally announced his candidacy on April 14, 2019 in South Bend.

He had been speculated as a potential candidate, visiting the early caucus state of Iowa in December 2018, where he announced he would not run for reelection in 2019. He would be the first openly gay elected official to run for president.

Early on, Buttigeg would solidify himself as a candidate ready to "turn the page". He made every debate and proved he could hang with the bigger names such as Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden & Elizabeth Warren. He gained points in the polls, and during the Iowa Caucuses, he declared himself victorious before results came in during his speech. He seemed to have been right, as Buttigeg earned 14 delegates in Iowa. He earned 9 in New Hampshire the following week. However, Buttigeg only earned 3 in Nevada despite his efforts with the Latino/Mexican community. He earned none in South Carolina, where the black population is high.

Philippe Méaille

Philippe Méaille (born 27 April 1973) is a French author and art collector, and the founder and president of the Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art.

Philippe Méaille owns the world's largest collection of Art & Language works.

When I was 20 or 21, I bought a work of Art & Language of 1965 called "Mirror Piece" and installed it in my appartment in Paris. After two or three days, I felt sad and stupid because I understood the limit imposed if these works were kept private. They would be like a discussion that was kept secret. Therefore I felt a responsibility to make this collection accessible to the widest possible public - "The Private Museum of the Future", Cristina Bechtler interview with Philippe Méaille, 2016.

Château de Montsoreau-Museum of contemporary art project began in November 2014. In June 2015, Philippe Méaille and created a surprise in France, jointly announcing the signing of a long-term lease (between the Maine-et-Loire department and Philippe Méaille) on the Chateau de Montsoreau property. The Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art becoming the first Château of the Loire Valley to be transformed into a museum of contemporary art. Despite the desire of both parties to create an international museum of contemporary art, and the ability from Méaille to endowing it with the world's largest collection of works by the radical conceptualists of Art & Language, and to seize the opportunity to develop the international tourist audience of the Loire Valley, the announcement created controversy. Frédéric Béatse, former Mayor of Angers, and socialist political leader, protests against what he calls « a sale of a jewel of the department to a private foreign player ». Gérard Persin (mayor of Montsoreau), and Christian Gillet both reacted very quickly to these protests during a press conference. Gérard Persin stated: « It is a pride to have been chosen to host a center of contemporary art of international stature ». Christian Gillet put the project in its international ambition and potential development for the territory: « The idea of Philippe Méaille, connoisseur and lover of the site, is to install a center of contemporary art featuring his collection, already world famous and renowned, we have considered an interesting challenge ». And Philippe Méaille clarified his intentions: « This public-private partnership appeared to us as an innovative solution that will be integrated into the Saumur territory in its entirety: Saumur and its agglomeration but also the nearby Fontevraud Abbey ».

For reasons of security due to political instability in Catalonia, Philippe Méaille announced that he decided to repatriate his collection in France to the Chateau de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art. MACBA deplored the decision of Philippe Méaille not to renew his long-term agreement with the institution, and assured that the security of the collection is guaranteed, and that "Philippe Méaille arguments do not coincide at all with reality".

Simpler text:

Polity

A polity is a group of people who are brought together by any form of political agreement and who consider themselves as forming an autonomous unit. The political agreement uniting the group may be of different types: it can be a written constitution or even the unwritten recognition and respect of a hierarchy within the group. Depending on the size of the polity, it can be organized by a government or other, simpler forms of hierarchy. It is important to realize that the term polity can be used to refer to big entities like states, empires, and kingdoms, but also to smaller units like chiefdoms. What counts in calling a given group "a polity" is not its size nor the form of government it has. To be called "a polity" a group must be an organized and autonomous group that has exclusive rights of use of a specific portion of land.

Test match (cricket)

Test matches in cricket are the orignal and main form of international competition. They last five days, and are thought to be the highest standard of play.

Test matches were invented in the 19th century as a competition between England and Australia. The first officially recognised Test match took place on 15–19 March 1877 and was played between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Australia won by 45 runs. A Test match to celebrate 100 years of Test cricket was held in Melbourne on 12–17 March 1977, in which Australia beat England by 45 runs—the same margin as that first Test. That first tour match was followed by a second test match, which was won by England. There were also a few games played against local teams, a tradition which continues today.

South Africa became the third team to play Test cricket in 1888–89, and there was a long period before other countries played test cricket. The West Indies ('Windies') were the fourth test country: they played against England in London 1928 at Lords cricket ground. New Zealand first played against England in 1930 in Christchurch. The first Indian test side played England in 1932 in London at Lords.

When British India was partitioned, the new nation Pakistan was given test status in 1952, on the recommendation of India. Their first test match was against India in Delhi. They were followed by Sri Lanka in 1982.

There are also four more countries who have full test status: Zimbabwe (1992), Bangladesh (2000), Ireland the Irish team represents both parts of Ireland – (2018), and Afghanistan (2018). Of these only Bangladesh has played regularly against the longer-established nations. There is a real gulf in playing standards between the top teams and the newcomers. This explains why there have been no test series between the stronger test countries and the weaker countries. A test series must be competitive for it to be commercially viable. Television rights need to be sold, and spectators attracted to the matches. Also, a country must be able to keep some cricket grounds to test standards.

It is clear that the sport of cricket spread mostly to countries of the former British Empire, with the notable exception of Canada (where cricket is just a minor sport). On the other hand, it is a truly international sport, played by nations in Europe, Africa (parts of), the Caribbean, the Indian subcontinent and Oceania.

Nawabs of Bengal

The Nawabs of Bengal (the Nawab Nizam of Bengal and Orissa) were the rulers of the provinces of Bengal and Orissa. Between 1717 and 1772, they were the rulers of the province of Bengal.

The last independent Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah, was betrayed in the Battle of Plassey by Mir Jafar. He lost to the British, who in 1757, installed Mir Jafar on the throne and established itself as a political power in Bengal.

In 1765 the system of 'dual government' meant the Nawabs ruled on behalf of the British, and were puppets to the British. In 1772 the system was abolished and Bengal was brought under direct control of the British. In 1793, when the "Nizamat" (governorship) of the Nawab was also taken away from them, they remained as the pensioners of the British East India Company. The last Nawab of Bengal, Mansur Ali Khan abdicated on 1 November 1880 in favour of his eldest son, Hassan Ali Mirza.

The only species, "Ingentia prima", meaning "first huge one", as the taxon was one of the first very large sauropodomorphs to evolve, along with its close relative Lessemsaurus. A second specimen, PVSJ 1087, was referred, containing five tail vertebrae, both the radius and ulna, a left calfbone and a right foot.

Ledumahadi (meaning "a giant thunderclap" in Sesotho language) is a sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Early Jurassic. A quadruped, it was one of the first giant sauropodomorphs, reaching a weight of around , despite not having evolved columnar limbs like its later huge relatives.

Lessemsaurus is an extinct genus of sauropod dinosaur from the Triassic period. It is unusual because it lived about 30 million years before the long-necked plant-eaters "Diplodocus" and "Brachiosaurus" lived.

The type species, "L. sauropoides", was formally described by José Bonaparte in 1999. It was found in the Los Colorados Formation of La Rioja Province, Argentina.

This dinosaur was around long and was discovered in strata dating to the Norian stage, around 210 million years ago.

Sanford Rosenthal

Sandford Rosenthal
Sanford Morris Rosenthal (May 5, 1897 – May 1, 1989) was born in Albany, Georgia.
He received a medical degree at Vanderbilt University in 1920, and completed a residency and internship at Boston City Hospital (1921-1922).
However, his interests shifted to medical research when he became a Fellow of the National Research Council in a pharmacology lab at Johns Hopkins University (1922-1925).
He worked in the Department of Pharmacology at McGill University in Montreal, Canada from 1925–1927.
Finally, in 1928, he joined the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) in Washington, D.C.
Dr. Rosenthal was Chief of the Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases (NIAMD) for 13 years before retiring in 1961.
He attained the rank of Medical Director in the USPHS Commissioned Officer Corps.
After retiring, Dr. Rosenthal continued to do research at the NIAMD for almost 20 years.
He was an author on over 110 papers between 1922 and 1975.

Dr. Rosenthal's first published paper provided a method for testing the health of the liver.
He showed that the rate at which the liver metabolizes an ingested dye can be used to quantify how well this organ functions.
His continued work on liver function tests resulted in the use of bromsulphthalein, which remains in use.

Dr. Rosenthal discovered that sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate was an antidote for mercury poisoning.
This antidote was widely used, and Dr. Rosenthal's discovery is considered one of the major achievements in the history of medical research at the NIH.

Based on his observation that sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate also has antibacterial activity, Dr. Rosenthal began work on another group of sulfur-containing compounds -– the sulfa drugs.
His decade-long work on sulfa drugs led to his discovery of a treatment for pneumococcal pneumonia with sulfanilamide.

In the early 1940s, Dr. Rosenthal worked on improving the ability of victims of severe burns to survive.
Death commonly resulted from shock due to fluid (plasma) loss from the burned skin. He discovered that the replacement of the salts that are in the secreted plasma is the key to a successful and simplified treatment.
During the 1950s and early 1960s, Dr. Rosenthal and colleagues undertook a long-term study to test the efficacy of drinking a saline solution (containing table salt and baking soda) to replace the lost salts (the "Peru Project").
His research group demonstrated that this therapy was an effective alternative to the traditional treatment using intravenous injections of whole blood or plasma.
The simplified burn therapy remains widely used.

Dr. Rosenthal and his collaborators were pioneers in the area of histamine biochemistry and physiology.
They developed a widely used method for quantifying histamine, worked on the pharmacology of histamines, and determined the biosynthetic pathway for spermidine.
Dr. Rosenthal also collaborated in research on the role of polyamines in the function of viral DNA.

Dr. Rosenthal was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1979.
He was also a member of American Medical Association, American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Society of American Bacteriologists, and Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

In 1962, he received the Public Health Service Meritorious Service Medal from the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
In 1973, he received the Harvey Stuart Allen Distinguished Service Award from the American Burn Association.
In 1980, he received the Award for Experimental Therapeutics from the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics in recognition of his pioneering work on the treatment of shock due to burns.

Wadati–Benioff zone

A Wadati–Benioff zone is an area within the Earth's crust where earthquakes frequently occur. The frequency of earthquakes in these areas is due to the convergence and subduction of tectonic plates.

According to the theory of plate tectonics lithospheric plates move towards each other along convergent plate boundaries. When two plates collide, one is often submerged below the other. They are referred as "downgoing" and "overriding" plates respectively.

When a downgoing plate (usually composed of oceanic lithosphere) submerges beneath an overriding plate shallow earthquakes occur at the plate boundary and deeper earthquakes occur in the downgoing plate as it sinks into the Earth. The deep earthquakes caused by the downgoing plate form the Wadati–Benioff zone. The deepest recorded earthquakes come from Wadati–Benioff zones and can extend to depths as much as 650 km (400 mi) deep.

In 1935 Kiyoo Wadati published research on earthquakes with deep foci and how they are apt to take place near the edges of continents. Further analysis of earthquake foci and location was conducted by Hugo Benioff in 1945 where he developed a way to identify the boundary at which an earthquake was generated. The dipping zone of seismic activity that they helped discover was named in their honor.

A missing person is a person who has disappeared and nobody seems to know where they are. People can go missing for many reasons.

People disappear for many reasons. These are some reasons why someone may go missing by choice:

There are also reasons why someone may go missing without wanting to:

Normally it is the police who search for a missing person. If someone goes missing at sea, they may instead call on the coast guard or a similar agency.

Most missing person cases that are reported to the police are simple cases, where the person is found quickly. In 1999, 800,000 children went missing in the United States, but only 115 cases were kidnapped by a stranger who wanted to keep them for a long period of time.

A small number of missing person cases are not solved for many years. These cases can be painful for friends and families, because they cannot be sure what happened to the person. In most countries, the law says that if someone has been missing for many years, the government can declare that the person is dead. This is known as "declaring death "in absentia"".
Sometimes there are cases of persons missing for no known reason:

Selective Service System

The Selective Service System is an independent agency of the United States government. It has information on those subject to the U.S. military draft. All male U.S. citizens and male immigrant non-citizens between ages 18 and 25 are required by law to register within 30 days of their 18th birthdays. They must also contact the Selective Service within ten days of any changes of any information they gave, like a change of address. Females, on the other hand, are not required to register.

Registration with Selective Service is also required for several federal programs and benefits, including job training, federal employment, naturalization, Pell grants and student loans.

On July 2, 1980, then-President Jimmy Carter signed Proclamation 4771 (Registration under the Military Selective Service Act). That was in response to the Soviet war in Afghanistan the previous year. It re-established the Selective Service registration requirement for all 18-to-26 year old men born on or after January 1, 1960.

The first registrations began on July 21, 1980 at various post offices across the United States, starting with men born in 1960. Men born in or after 1963 were required to register within 30 days of their 18th birthday.

On April 27, 2016, the Armed House Services Committee voted to add an amendment to extend the authority for draft registration to females. If the bill had passed, it would have authorized then-President Barack Obama to order young women as well as men to register with the Selective System.

Superpermutation

In combinatorial math, a superpermutation is a list of numbers that contains each different arrangement of symbols it is made up of inside of it. While superpermutations can simply be made up of every arrangement listed side by side, it can also be shorter. Sometimes, the arrangements may overlap. For example, when there are 2 different symbols, the superpermutation 1221 contains all possible arrangements, 12 and 21. The list 121 also contains both permutations, 12 at the beginning and 21 at the end.

As the number of symbols increases, the length of the superpermutation increases, too. The superpermutation with only 1 symbol is only 1 long (1), while the 2nd superpermutation is 3 long (121). The 3rd superpermutation is 9 long (123121321), and the 4th one is 33 long (123412314231243121342132413214321). The length of the superpermutation with 5 symbols is 153, and it looks like this:

123451234152341253412354123145231425314235142315423124531243512431
52431254312134521342513421534213542132451324153241352413254132145
3214352143251432154321

Right now, mathematicians do not know what the smallest superpermutation is when there are six or more symbols. However, over time the choices of what they could be have narrowed considerably from both above and below.

In September 2011, an unknown person on the internet forum 4chan showed people that there was definitely a smallest superpermutation for any superpermutation with more than 1 symbol. On the website, it was called "The Haruhi Problem", from a Japanese anime called "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya." It was phrased like this: what would be the shortest amount of episodes that you would need to watch in order to guarantee that you watched every episode of a show? In October 2018, mathematician Robin Houston tweeted about it. 

On October 25, 2018, Robin Houston, Jay Pantone, and Vince Vatter made the unknown person's proof better and posted it to the mathematics community.

On October 20 2018, Greg Egan found smaller superpermutations for ones with six or more symbols than there had ever been. This shows that smallest superpermutation must be at most that size. 

As time goes on, people think that the smallest and largest possible lengths for these superpermutations will be narrowed down further. There is only one definite smallest superpermutation for each number of symbols.

Gendarmerie

The gendarmerie means either the place where gendarmes are stationed or a military armed force. The gendarmerie is part of the army. In places where gendarmes are deployed outside, they also have a provost function.

The term gendarme comes from the old medieval French "Gens d'armes". In English, it can be translated as men-at-arms. In Italy, they are called "carabinieri". In first use, a troop of horsemen equipped with a carbine.
Like the police, it has a role in road safety and surveillance of military places. The gendarmerie also provides mountain rescue capability. In conflict zones, the gendarmerie's function is the restoration of law and order as a provost unit. In addition to the police, the gendarmerie has military equipments such as armored transport.

The use of military units for civilian police is common to many eras and cultures. Belgium and Austria had gendarmeries (Royal Guard), but they merged with civilian police. Many former French colonies, particularly in Africa, have kept gendarmeries. The common symbol of the gendarmerie is the inflamed grenade. This symbol was used first by the French gendarmerie.

Rocky Mount, North Carolina

Rocky Mount is a city in Edgecombe and Nash counties in the Atlantic coastal plain region of the U.S. state of North Carolina. The city's population was 54,341 at the 2020 census. 

Rocky Mount has received the All-America City Award from the National Civic League two times, in 1969 and 1999.

The region around the Tar River had several types of indigenous people for 12,000 years. It had been home to the historic Tuscarora people, who spoke an Iroquoian language, for a long time before the first Europeans arrived. After the English colonists and indigenous allies started the Tuscarora War in the early 1700s, they drove most of the survivors off to the North. The English speakers then began to settle the area.

The Falls of the Tar River Primitive Baptist Church was established in 1757. The church was the center of community life, and its records were the first records of the developing town. It effectively ran the law enforcement for the town.

A post office was made at the falls of the Tar River on March 22, 1816. The name "Rocky Mount" starts appearing in documented history at this point. The name referred to the rocky mound at the falls of the Tar River. Rocky Mount Mills, the second cotton mill in the state of North Carolina, was built there soon after in 1818. Its proprietors were two entrepreneurs and Joel Battle, who was the grandson of an original colonist who lived in the area. Joel bought out the other proprietors before giving the mill to his cousin James Smith Battle. The mill's spindles were run by enslaved African Americans until the 1850s. At that time, the mill owners only hired white women and girls, who were employed for the rest of the century.

The Battle family was also involved in building the longest continuous railroad in the world at the time, the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, which ran about east of the mill. The railroad had a lot of influence on the development of the town. In 1871, the county line moved from the Tar River to its present location in the center of the tracks. The Raleigh-Tarboro stage route also passed just south of Rocky Mount.

During the Civil War, the area was attacked in 1863 by Union troops under the command of Brigadier General Edward E. Potter. They destroyed the mill, which supplied the Confederates yarn and cloth. After the war ended, the owners rebuilt the mill. On February 19, 1867, the village outside the mill was incorporated as a town.

In the second half of the 19th century, the tobacco industry became very important in the state. Rocky Mount could take advantage of the very quickly rising demand for brightleaf tobacco that grew best in sandy soil because it was next to the coastal plain. Tobacco also affected the city's social life. Warehouses where tobacco was stored and sold began hosting balls for the community in the 1880s. These became known as "june germans" for the time of year and style of dance. June Germans eventually became all-night dance parties and attracted musicians and socialites from miles around well into the 1900s. By the end of the 19th century, tobacco had replaced King Cotton as the town's main cash crop.

At the start of the 20th century, Rocky Mount became the northern headquarters of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, which had its major repair shops and yard facilities in the town. This caused a lot of railroad employees to come to the town. In 1900, Rocky Mount's population was around 3,000.

On February 28, 1907, with a population around 7,500, Rocky Mount was officially incorporated as a city. A vibrant central business district arose.

As in the rest of the South, states made racial segregation legal. This included discrimination in where people could live. White suburbs were mostly on the west side of town, such as Villa Place and West Haven. Black neighborhoods, such as Crosstown and Around the "Y", where jazz musician Thelonious Monk was born, were mostly on the east side of town.

Several notable Civil Rights events occurred in Rocky Mount. In 1946, African-American tobacco warehouse workers voted to organize in Rocky Mount as part of a broader nationwide movement known as Operation Dixie. It included voter registration to fight against disenfranchisement of blacks and other actions against segregation. On November 27, 1962, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech at Booker T. Washington High School. He used his refrain "I have a dream" a year before his more famous speech at the March on Washington. The city had a sanitation workers' strike in 1978 when government sanitation workers protested their black co-worker being wrongfully arrested. He was acquitted in court on the charges. In 2018 the city council apologized to him for the case.
After WWII, the city continued to grow. In the 1950s and 1960s, the city's economy started to include banking, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and the headquarters of a fast food chain known as Hardee's.

New higher education buildings were made, including North Carolina Wesleyan College in 1956 and Nash Community College and Edgecombe Community College in 1968. In 1970, Rocky Mount received an All-America City Award. In the 1970s the city's hospitals were combined under Nash General Hospital. That was also the period of completion of Rocky Mount–Wilson Regional Airport.

From the 1980s, the inner city suffered urban decay, as businesses had moved out to suburban highway locations. Rocky Mount's downtown got worse as new neighborhoods and shopping malls were built, such as Golden East Crossing. The city also expanded its borders by annexing nearby cities, such as Battleboro to the north. In 1999, the city won its second All-America City Award.

In the fall of 1999 two hurricanes hit eastern North Carolina. Both passed over Rocky Mount. Hurricane Dennis hit the town as a tropical storm in August with of rain and Hurricane Floyd hit it in September with nearly of rain. During Hurricane Floyd, most of the flooding happened quickly overnight. Many people did not know about the flooding until the water came into their homes. A lot of people needed to be rescued. The hurricane caused the worst flooding in the history of the Tar River, which was already full of water from the hurricane in August. Many homes and businesses were destroyed.

At the start of the 21st century, the city has encouraged efforts to improve the historic downtown, supporting projects to renovate buildings such as the Rocky Mount station and Douglas Block, or repurpose them, such as the Imperial Centre for Arts and Sciences.

In 2007, Capitol Broadcasting Company bought Rocky Mount Mills. It is adapting it as a mixed-use campus of breweries, restaurants, residential lofts, and event space. Major new community projects include the sports complex and downtown event center. In 2019, CSX, the successor company of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, developed a new intermodal cargo terminal that is expected to improve the local economy in the next decade.

Next to the Tar River, the Rocky Mount Mills Village grew in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a small community of tenants working for the mill. Built between 1885 and 1940, each home in the historic district is recognized by the National Register of Historic Places. Changes in industrialization eventually forced the mill to close. However, when the mill closed, the property remained intact. Though the property has been a rental for its entire existence, covenants are placed on the property to assure home ownership and owner occupancy and protect the historical integrity of the district.

He cannot recall the last time he had physical contact with a woman. He's in debt to Shangri-La casino boss Shelly Kaplow. Kaplow cured Lootz' habit by breaking his kneecap. Kaplow had also paid Lootz' casino debts. Lootz' debt is nearly paid off.

Lootz is not satisfied with the casino business. He tells Kaplow he is leaving Las Vegas soon. But his future success as a luck "cooler" is changed when he meets cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario. She becomes interested in him. Lootz' luck. His luck, and the luck of those around him, take turns for the better.

What Lootz doesn't know yet is that Shelly may have paid Natalie to seduce him into staying and working for Shangri-La. What Shelly doesn't know is Natalie has fallen in love with Lootz, and vice versa. 

Other complications hit when Shelly, a relative old-timer, resists efforts from new Shangri-La owner advisers who want to update the casino hotel property and bring the hotel into the 21st century.

War of the Austrian Succession

The War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748) involved most countries in Europe. It was fought over Archduchess Maria Theresa's succession to the Habsburg Monarchy. The war included other events such as King George's War in British America, the War of Jenkins' Ear (which formally began on 23 October 1739), the First Carnatic War in India, the Jacobite rising of 1745 in Scotland and the First and the Second Silesian Wars.

Maria Theresa was not allowed to succeed to the various crowns of her father, Charles VI, because Salic law would not let a woman inherit them. That gave an opportunity for France and Prussia, joined by Bavaria, to challenge the Habsburgs' power. Maria Theresa was supported by Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, Sardinia, and Saxony.

Spain had been at war with Britain over colonies and trade since 1739 to re-establish its influence in northern Italy, which Austria had taken control during the War of the Spanish Succession, in the early 18th century.

The war ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. Maria Theresa was confirmed as Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary, but Prussia kept control of Silesia. The peace did not last, however, because of Austria's desire to recapture Silesia and the political upheaval in Europe. Soon came the Seven Years' War (1756–1763).

Sole (fish)

Sole is a flatfish belonging to several families. Generally speaking, they are members of the family Soleidae.

Outside Europe, the name "sole" is also given to various other similar flatfish, especially other members of the sole suborder Soleoidei as well as members of the flounder family, the Pleuronectidae. 

In European cookery, the common or Dover sole "Solea solea", is often simply called "the sole". It is the most widely available, and often thought to be the best.

Pleuronectidae

The Pleuronectidae are a family of flatfish that are widely known as righteye flounders. The reason why they're called like that is because most species lie on the seabed on their left sides, with both eyes on their right sides. Only a few species can also have their eyes on the left side. Females lay eggs that float in mid-water until the larvae develop, and they sink to the bottom.

They are found on the bottoms of oceans around the world. The name of the family is derived from the Greek πλευρά ("pleura"), meaning "rib" or "side", and νηκτόν ("nekton"), meaning "swimming".

Highland cattle

The Highland cattle (; ) is a Scottish cattle breed. They have long horns and long, wavy, woolly coats. The long oily outer hair covers a downy undercoat. This makes them well suited to conditions in the Highlands, which have a high annual rainfall and sometimes very strong winds.

Highlands are raised primarily for their meat. They originated in the Scottish Highlands and the Outer Hebrides. They were first mentioned in the 6th century AD. They have since been exported worldwide.

They are a hardy breed. Their long hair gives them the ability to overwinter in the valleys. Bulls can weigh up to 800 kilograms (1,800 pounds) and cows can up to 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds). Their milk generally has a high butterfat content. Their meat, which is of the highest quality, is lower in cholesterol than other varieties of beef.

Phlogiston theory

The phlogiston theory once put forward the belief that there was a fire-like element called phlogiston inside combustible bodies which was released during combustion. When the substances burned, the phlogiston escaped leaving a solid ash called calx. This theory explained why the mass after burning fuels was less than the original mass.

The theory was first suggested in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher, but was dismissed at the end of the 18th century following further experiments by Antoine Lavoisier and others.

Careful experiments that measured the masses of gasses showed that the phlogiston theory was wrong. This led to the discovery of oxygen. However, some scientists continued to believe in phlogiston. They thought this explained the heat and light given off in combustion reactions. Today we see this as evidence of the transfer of energy to the surroundings.

Unbitrium

Unbitrium (), also known as eka-protactinium or element 123, is the possible chemical element in the periodic table that has the temporary symbol Ubt and has the atomic number 123. Calculations have shown that Ubt would be the most stable isotope. The closed neutron shells say that Ubt and Ubt would be the most stable isotopes. 

As of February 2021, no attempt has ever been made to make element 123.

The name unbitrium is a systematic element name, used as a placeholder until it is confirmed by other research groups and the IUPAC decides on a name. Usually, the name suggested by the discoverer(s) is chosen.

This reaction would create Ubt, which is expected to be relatively stable.

In the fictional universe of "", this element was seemingly discovered and named. The episode "Rascals" depicted a "trans-periodic table," in a schoolroom set, which depicted element number 123 as being named jamesium, symbol Rj, having an atomic weight of 326. The graphic was created by set artists, probably a homage to designer Richard D. James, and listed this element in the fictional "gamma series."

In the third episode of season one of the television series "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." element 123 is depicted 24 minutes in as the element Gravitonium, atomic weight 308



Unbipentium

Unbipentium is a hypothetical (theoretical or imagined) element of the periodic table. It is also known as eka-neptunium.
The atomic number of this element is 125. It has the symbol Ubp. The name Unbipentium and the symbol Ubp are temporary IUPAC names. This name and symbol exist until a permanent name is decided. It is expected to be a g-block element and an superactinides. It is the sixth element in the eighth period of the periodic table.

The synthesis of unbipentium was first attempted in 1977 by bombarding a target of Americium-238 with zinc-65 ions at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany:
No atoms were identified.

Romanization of Greek

Romanization of Greek is a way to write the Greek language (either Ancient or Modern Greek) with the Roman alphabet. That can be done by mapping either letters (called transliteration) or sounds (called transcription. The Greek name Ἰωάννης can be transliterated as "Johannes", which became John in Modern English. In Modern Greek, it is generally written Γιάννης, which transliterates to "Yannis". The masculine Greek word Ἅγιος or Άγιος might variously appear as "Hagiοs", "Agios", "Aghios" or "Ayios", or it might simply be translated as "Holy" or "Saint" in English forms of Greek placenames.

Traditional English renderings of Greek names originated from Roman systems that were established in antiquity. The Roman alphabet was a form of the Cumaean alphabet, which was itself developed from the Euboean script, which used as , as , and variant forms of and that later became L and S. When the Euboean script was used to write the classical Greek alphabet, ⟨κ⟩ was replaced with ⟨c⟩, ⟨αι⟩ and ⟨οι⟩ became ⟨æ⟩ and ⟨œ⟩, and ⟨ει⟩ and ⟨ου⟩ were simplified to ⟨i⟩ (more rarely, corresponding to an earlier pronunciation, to ⟨e⟩) and ⟨u⟩. Aspirated consonants like ⟨θ⟩, ⟨φ⟩, initial-⟨ρ⟩, and ⟨χ⟩ simply wrote out the sound: ⟨th⟩, ⟨ph⟩, ⟨rh⟩, and ⟨ch⟩. Because English orthography has changed so much from the original Greek, modern scholarly transliteration now usually renders ⟨κ⟩ as ⟨k⟩ and the diphthongs ⟨αι, οι, ει, ου⟩ as ⟨ai, oi, ei, ou⟩. Modern scholars also increasingly render ⟨χ⟩ as ⟨kh⟩. Greek sounds greatly changed, and Modern Greek sounds quite different from Ancient Greek. That also has had an influence on the terms used in English and other languages and had led to a number of different romanizations for names and placenames in the 19th and the 20th centuries. The Hellenic Organization for Standardization (ELOT) issued its system in co-operation with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1983. The system was adopted (with minor modifications) by the United Nations' Fifth Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names at Montreal in 1987, by the United Kingdom's Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use (PCGN) and by the United States' Board on Geographic Names (BGN) in 1996, and by the ISO itself in 1997. Romanization of names for official purposes, as with passports and identity cards, were required to use the ELOT system within Greece until 2011, when a legal decision permitted Greeks to use irregular forms (such as "Demetrios" for ) provided that official identification and documents also list the standard forms (as, for example, "Demetrios OR Dimitrios"). Other romanization systems are the BGN/PCGN's earlier 1962 system and the system employed by the American Library Association and the United States' Library of Congress.

Zyklon B

Zyklon B was the trade name of a pesticide invented in Germany in the early 1920s. It contains hydrogen cyanide as well as other chemicals. 

The product was used in Nazi Germany in gas chambers to kill Jews as part of the Holocaust, such as at Auschwitz and other extermination camps.

Hydrogen cyanide, present in Zyklon B, is a poisonous gas that interferes with respiration in cells. The cyanide ion stops the cell from making ATP by binding into a protein involved in the reaction.

Hydrogen cyanide had been discovered in the late 18th century and was usually used in California for the fumigation of citrus trees. In 1919, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung mbH (Degesch) was founded in Germany. This was a state-controlled group to investigate military uses of the chemical. The new product was marketed as a pesticide, Zyklon, but was soon banned as being similar to a mixture used in World War I as a weapon.

Zyklon B was recreated by Degesch, after Degesch came under new management, and eventually after achieving a patent, Walter Heerdt was named as its inventor.

It was used at U.S Customs facilities along the Mexican border to fumigate the clothes of border crossers.

Zegler has performed leading roles in school musicals, and local theaters even occasional work as a wedding singer. At 18, Zegler signed with ICM Partners.

When we discovered the beginning of the casting of the adaptation of Snow White, the public immediately reacted to the Colombian origins and the skin color of the actress, specifying that she does not correspond to the character of Snow White. She will be criticized again because of her interventions considered very contemptible in the media, many users on social networks criticize Disney for having chosen the worst person embodying Snow White because Rachel shows contempt for the source material, which she didn't understand the story and meaning in calling the prince to be a stalker, referring to wokism. Feminists do not fail to react against Rachel by declaring her a False Feminist. David Halle Hand, the son of director David Dodd Hand of 1937 Snow White says he finds it shameful and that Disney has no respect for his father and Walt's work, destroying the masterpiece that propelled cinema and the Disney company.

During the "Rock the City" actors' strike his comments which occurred shortly after the controversy surrounding her around Snow White made her quickly become the target of the general public again. She declares that she should be paid for every hour of streaming because she wears a princess dress for 18 hours, during this declaration she is not trying to defend the cause of the other actors but her own cause. Many people around the world have criticized her for these comments and consider her to be an arrogant, selfish person and many agree that she is the most hated Hollywood actress.

In February 2021, Zegler and actor Josh Andrés Rivera confirmed that they were dating. The two had met on the set of "West Side Story."

They want to push the United States to using 100% renewable, zero-emission energy sources. Their plan would also address poverty in the U.S., and implement universal health care. The American Action Network estimated the plan would cost at least $1 trillion, and the document did not show where the money would specifically come from.

Jill Stein talked about the GND as early as 2012. The GND is officially in the Green Party USA's platform.

The British Red Cross is recognised by the UK Government as one of three Voluntary Aid Societies, the other two being St John Ambulance and St Andrew's Ambulance Association. They are the sole Red Cross Society for the United Kingdom and the British Overseas Territories. 

The British Red Cross operate an Emergency Response service, which act to support the governmental emergency services in times of crisis. 

For example, first aid support (and distribution of first aid supplies), managing a disaster appeal scheme or providing telephone support lines after a disaster are frequent tasks of the British Red Cross. All services of the British Red Cross can be used for the emergency response service if needed. For example, ambulances belonging to the British Red Cross can be used to help the NHS in caring for the injured. 

The British Red Cross will (and have done before) deal with emergencies in the UK, such as the Manchester Arena Bombing or the Grenfell Tower fire, as well as more environmental emergencies such as floods. They do not send volunteers abroad to help in emergencies as these are dealt with by the local emergency services.

The IRC (International Red Cross movement) is the largest provide of first aid in the world and the British Red Cross frequently provide first aid at sports events, concerts and other large events. 

The training done by Event First Aid Service volunteers varies, but all of them have access to advanced training, becoming part of an Ambulance Crew or even becoming a fully qualified ambulance technician. The British Red Cross do employ paramedics, but they do not train them in-house.

Deltarune

Deltarune is a role-playing video game. It was created by American indie developer Toby Fox.

In the game, the player controls a human named Kris. The game is set in a world where monsters live on the surface of the Earth. Kris and a classmate, Susie, fall from Earth into a place called the “Dark World”. In the Dark World, they meet Ralsei. Ralsei tells them that they are heroes destined to restore balance to the world. Through the combat system, the player meets different enemies who attack with a bullet hell style of attack. These encounters can be resolved peacefully or with combat. The first chapter of the game was released on October 31, 2018 for Microsoft Windows and macOS for free. A Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 version was released in February 28, 2019. The second chapter was released on Windows and macOS in September 17, 2021. The graphics of the game are similar to 16-bit Japanese role-playing games such as "EarthBound", "" and "Chrono Trigger".

"Deltarune" is a spin-off of Fox's earlier game, "Undertale". Deltarune is an anagram for the name of that game. The setting of the game is "not the world of "Undertale"", according to Fox although the characters and settings are similar. Future chapters were planned as a paid release, but no release dates have been announced.

"Deltarune", like "Undertale", is a role-playing game that uses a top-down perspective. The player controls a human named Kris. They have to complete objectives in order to beat the game. During some parts of the game, the player is allowed to choose attacks of other characters in the game. Combat is similar to most turn-based role-playing games. Players chose from a set of actions such as "Attack" or "Spare". While the game is biased towards avoiding fights, one of the party members, Susie, would rather attack enemies than spare them. Because of this, the player has to choose actions that will stop Susie from hurting enemies if they do not want to attack the enemy. The game also has TP (Tension Points). These can be used to allow team members to use spells such as "Pacify".

Upon starting the game for the first time, the player is allowed to create an avatar. After making this avatar, it is deleted, with the player being told that "No one can choose who they are in this world."

The player begins with the story as Kris, a human who lives with their adoptive mother Toriel, a goat-like monster. Toriel drops Kris off at school, where Kris goes to a class taught by Alphys, a lizard-like monster. Susie, another lizard-like monster who is Kris' classmate, is sent to get chalk for the blackboard from the supply closet along with Kris. After Kris and Susie enter the supply closet, both of them are pulled into the "Dark World". There, they meet Ralsei, a prince of the dark, who tells them that the three of them are heroes destined to close a geyser of dark energy to restore balance to that world. However, the King has seized control of the Dark World and is determined to spread darkness.

Susie chooses not to help, only wanting to return to her own world. However, the three encounter Lancer, the King's son, who tries to stop them from getting further with various poorly thought out plans. Susie eventually decides to join Lancer, leaving Kris and Ralsei on their own. As Kris and Ralsei make their way to the King's castle, Susie makes friends with Lancer, and the four eventually become a team. Upon realizing that they will have to face the King, Lancer runs off to the castle and tells the King's henchmen to throw Kris, Ralsei, and Susie into the dungeon.

Susie escapes the dungeon and confronts Lancer, who explains he wanted to keep Susie and the King from hurting each other. Susie promises Lancer she won't hurt the King. Kris, Susie and Ralsei go to the top of the castle and battle the King. Eventually, the King falls to the ground in exhaustion and Ralsei heals him. However, this is revealed to be a ruse as the King quickly stops the three heroes from being able to act, threatening to kill them all. If the player has not ended previous battles by fighting throughout the game, Lancer turns the King's men against him and imprisons him, taking his father's place. Otherwise, Ralsei subdues the King with a magic spell.

The group closes the dark geyser, so Kris and Susie can return to their own world. There, Susie says goodbye, mentioning that she wants to go to the Dark World again. The player can explore the town before having Kris go home to bed.

That night, Kris, without player input, shakes in bed, then falls on the floor, and limps to the center of the room. Kris tears into their chest and rips out their soul, throwing it into a birdcage in the corner of the room. Kris draws a knife and turns toward the viewer. They smile, with their right eye flashing red,

The day after Chapter 1 takes place, it is discovered that when Kris pulled out the knife, they had eaten an entire pie rather than committing homicide. Kris and Susie go back to school, and Kris sleeps for the entire class. They meet up with Susie outside of the classroom after class and revisit the Dark World, after being invited to study in the library by Noelle. Confused, Susie asks where everyone is, so Ralsei has Kris get all the stuff from the abandoned classroom into the closet. After doing this, Castle Town becomes populated. When Kris goes to leave, Susie complains about the group project, only to have Ralsei banish them until they start it. Lancer and Rouxls Kaard enter the Kris' Key Items, and they set off for the library. When they go there, they enter the computer lab and find another dark world. There, they reunite with Ralsei, and meet Queen. They then see Noelle captured by Queen, and end up playing against Queen in an arcade game similar to Punch-Out!!. After doing that, the group explores Cyber Field and meets the Sweet Captain Cakes, a band and resistance force against Queen. It is revealed that they thought that you were helping Queen capture Noelle. This leads to the first boss fight of the game. After that, you go to a roller coaster where you fight your classmate Berdly, who allied with Queen. After beating Berdly, you fall into a pile of trash. You split off from the rest of the party, and meet Noelle, who joins you. After getting up to either funny antics avoiding Queen or committing mass murder, you get in Queen's car to help her look for Noelle, who is disguised and also in the car. You face a traffic jam, and you split off to make a detour to clear it up. But first, you end up fighting Spamton, a deranged car salesman. 

"Deltarune" was developed by Fox in GameMaker Studio 2. The game introduces a new battle system influenced by the "Final Fantasy" franchise, contrasting with the original game's combat system (which was inspired by that of the "Mother" series). Some of the music in the game remixes much of the soundtrack of "Undertale", but most pieces are new. The main game uses sounds from "EarthBound", while battle music is similar to "Breath of Fire III" music, and even Lancer's theme is similar to J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai's opening theme. The game also has many similarities with "Undertale" in the name of characters, for example, Ralsei (one of the main characters) is an anagram of Asriel (a character from "Undertale") and Kris (the main character from "Deltarune") is almost an anagram of Frisk (the main character from "Undertale"). The name of the game, "Deltarune" is an anagram of "Undertale." Temmie Chang, who helped as artist in Undertale, served as the main artist for the game, designing characters, sprites and animations.

After previously teasing something "Undertale"-related a day earlier on Twitter, Fox released the first chapter of "Deltarune", a game "intended for people who have completed "Undertale"", on October 31, 2018 for Windows and macOS for free. Fox said that this release is the first part of a new project, and considered the release a "survey program" to determine how to take the project further. Fox mentioned that "Deltarune" will be a larger project than "Undertale". He will release it as one game (not chapters) after forming a team to develop it. Fox plans for "Deltarune" to have only one ending.

Opportunity (rover)

Opportunity, also known as MER-B (Mars Exploration Rover – B) or MER-1, and nicknamed Oppy, was a robotic rover that was active on Mars from 2004 to 2018.

It was launched on July 7, 2003, as part of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover program, it landed in Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004, three weeks after its twin "Spirit" (MER-A) touched down on the other side of the planet Mars.

With a planned 90-sol duration of activity (slightly more than 90 earth days), "Spirit" functioned until getting stuck in 2009 and stopped communications in 2010. "Opportunity" was able to stay operational for 5352 sols after landing, maintaining its power and key systems through continual recharging of its batteries through solar power.

"Opportunity" was active for (in Earth Time), 55 times more than its lifespan. By June 10, 2018, when it last contacted NASA, the rover had traveled a distance of .

Due to the massive dust storms on Mars in 2018, "Opportunity" stopped communications on June 10, 2018. It was hoped it would reboot once the atmosphere cleared. However it did not, as it either suffered a catastrophic failure or that a layer of dust has covered its solar panels.

On February 13, 2019, NASA officials declared that the "Opportunity" mission was complete, after the spacecraft failed to respond to repeated signals sent since August 2018. Oppy worked for 14 years trying to find water, it found evidence of water, like finding types of rocks only found in water, and clay that suggested fresh water once existed.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower (novel)

The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a novel written by Stephen Chbosky (this sounds like: "Stiven Shebosky") and released in 1999. Each chapter of the book is a letter written by the main character, a boy of 15 called Charlie, to an unnamed friend. When you read the book, this gives the feeling that Charlie is writing to you.

In the book, the English teacher gives Charlie books to read that he thought he would enjoy. One of these books is "The Catcher in the Rye" by J. D. Salinger, which Chbosky says was an inspiration for him to write "The Perks of Being a Wallflower". Also some music titles had inspired him, for example <nowiki>"</nowiki>Asleep" from "The Smiths".

Stephen Chbosky was born in Pittsburgh, the same town where "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" plays. He has said that much of what Charlie writes about in the book is based on what he, the author, has experienced himself.

The book was published on 1 February 1999 by Pocket Books and was later translated in 13 languages and sold in 16 countries all over the world, especially when a film based on the book was made in 2012.

Charlie writes letters anonymously, he changes all the names, that way the reader won't find out who he is. And all of them are sent to someone because he wants for someone to listen and understand him. He explains his life through these letters. Firstly, he talks about his friend Michael who killed himself. Charlie does not understand why he did it, but he is really emotional because of it. Charlie is told that one of the reasons why he killed himself is because of “problems at home”. Charlie starts to ask himself if he is in a similar position, then he introduces his family members and relationship with them. He mentions his aunt Helen who was his favorite person, however she died. Charlie is about to start high school, and he is nervous about it. He doesn't like high school and finds it completely different from middle school. He realizes that everybody has changed and they behave differently with him. He feels lonely and wants to have friends. He has a good relationship with his teacher Bill, who believes that he has a great skill at reading and understanding language. Charlie talks about his sister and her boyfriend, who fight a lot. He one time catches them having sex, but he is too innocent to understand.

Charlie goes to the football game, that he used to go to with his dead friend Michael. There he meets Patrick and Sam for the first time. Patrick and Sam are step siblings and Charlie develops a crush on Sam, but Sam has no interest in Charlie. After thinking a lot about girls and couples he goes to Bill and tells him what is bothering him: his sister’s boyfriend Derek had hit her. When the teacher talks about it with their parents, the dad does not allow his daughter to see Derek anymore and she gets mad with Charlie. At that moment, Charlie has a flashback of his past, in which a girl is raped by a guy in his room in front of him. Charlie goes to a party with his new friends, Sam and Patrick, where he gets stoned for the first time. After that night, everyone calls him Wallflower.

Charlie talks for the first time about Mary Elisabeth.

Charlie recalls memories with Michael. Charlie and his friends play a "secret Santa" together, where Charlie reads out a poem that Michael gave to him, however he does not know that it was written by Michael.

Sam and Patrick are visiting the Grand Canyon, so Charlie is alone. Soon it is Christmas and Charlies birthday. He hates it, because it is the day where his aunt Helen died, so it is a hard time for him. Charlie feels very guilty for her death, because she died in a car accident while buying him a birthday present. For Christmas, Charlie goes with his family to the family of his dad. In his old room, he thinks a lot about his family and about Helen. His mother is very worried about him, because after the death of Helen he had to go to the hospital and had to talk with a doctor. Charlie still sometimes has panic attacks when he thinks too much about it. After visiting Helen’s grave, he feels better but is still missing her. When Charlie drives to a New Year’s Eve party he finally sees Sam and Patrick again.

Charlie writes letters to an unknown person. He tells about his family and about his past. Charlie is very happy, because the conversation with his psychiatrist makes him very happy. Charlie talks with his friends about his psychiatrist, the Beatles, and more. Charlie writes about an awkward situation. He got an erection in class and had to go to the blackboard. He was only wearing a swimsuit so you could see his erection. Charlie also asked a girl for a date, but she does not want to answer him and be alone. Then he went with another girl to the prom, which then ran away. When he came home, he suddenly heard his sister crying again because she was pregnant.

Charlie asked his dad for the car, because he was going to have another date with Mary Elisabeth. That night, dad came to his room and talked about sex to Charlie. Then they went to the record store and had first sex there. Since they were together, Mary Elisabeth was calling Charlie every day. Charlie's parents invited Sam and Patrick for a dinner, Mary Elisabeth asked to join them. After that, Charlie came to find his sister and brother to ask, how to deal with Mary Elisabeth. Next day in school, Mary Elisabeth gave Charlie a book, but he returned it to the book store. Then he regretted and got it back and brought Mary Elisabeth a gift. On Friday, they had a party in Craig's house and they played "Truth or Dare", Charlie chose a dare and had to kiss the most beautiful girl in the room. Without thinking, he kissed Sam, and after that the relationship between him and Mary Elizabeth was broken and the entire group told him they didn’t want to see him anymore.

Charlie is lonely without his friends. He is trying to survive the grey days by analyzing his environment, especially people’s behaviour. He spends his time at the local mall alone, sometimes with the English teacher, Bob, and his books. Once he met with Susan, he asked her about their dead friend: "Do you ever miss him ?" The girl just bats her eyelids and stayed quiet. Susan’s company said something rude behind Charlie’s back. Brad appears at school, but he has changed a lot. Brad wounded Patrick’s heart with words, like "faggot" at the cafeteria. During this tough period, Charlie stands on Patrick’s side, he even fought for him. At a Saturday morning, Charlie got a phone call from Patrick, which made his day. Since then, they spend days together, Charlie means a lot to Patrick.

Stephen Chbosky (born January 25,1970 in Pittsburgh) is an American novelist, film director, and screenwriter. He is known for writing "The Perks of Being a Wallflower", which is a New-York-Times Bestseller. Chbosky is also known for writing and directing the movie version of this book, starring Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. Later, he wrote the screenplay for the movies "Rent" and the live-action adaptation of "Beauty and the Beast" of 2017. Stephen Chbosky also directed the movie "Wonder".

In most parts of the book, Charlie is talking about the struggles of coming of age. His everyday problems can be divided into three sectors. When describing his “friend”, he complains the “fears of adulthood”. Stephen Chbosky summarises this aspect with the well-fitting quote “It's much easier not to know things sometimes.” Charlie, the “wallflower” isn't ready to take the responsibility for his own life. High school, love and parties are overstraining him. “People who try to control situations all the time are afraid that if they don't, nothing will work out the way they want.” is Charlie's way to accept, that life happens the way it does and that he must stand it.

Main quote of the second part of coming of age, “What you need in life”, is “We accept the love we deserve.” Bill teaches Charlie that it needs more than people who give you love. You must give back. You must love yourself. You must trust others. You can't love alone. Charlie is also wishing for a person to keep contact “I just need to know that someone out there listens and understands.” By all the mess he had to go through, he tries not to lose his good mind about community.

Last main part of growing up is “becoming individual”. Sam, and also Charlie, understand that being an adult means to be unique. “I'm going to do what I want to do. I'm going to be who I really am. And I'm going to figure out what that is.”. That’s the way Sam declares her readiness. But adolescence also is about doubting, “Just tell me how to be different in a way that makes sense.” The book conveys an important advice to pass adolescence: Just be yourself, find out who you are, leave your past far behind, but never forget where you started.

Music is a very important part of Charlie’s life. Mostly, he listens to music in the car, either on the radio or from one of his mix tapes. These mix tapes are pretty special, because they are made by a person with their personal and favorite songs. Charlie thinks that when you know the taste of music of a person, then you already know them, because music says a lot about someone. Because of the personality, mix tapes are often used as a present. With music, Charlie connects a lot of memories, from car rides, high school dances, theatres or parties. On the mix tape of his sister is Charlie’s favorite song, called „Asleep“. He really loves this song and whenever he feels sad or lonely, Charlie listens to it.

In the novel, many books by other authors are mentioned. Charlie’s English teacher sees that Charlie loves reading and writing, so he helps him develop his skills by giving him extra "homework": books to read and essays to write.

Those books are:


Charlie likes all the books except "Naked Lunch" because he does not understand it.

All these books were written between 1911 and 1960; by and by, Charlie starts to see similarities in the books.

Charlie went to the high school football game. He went to the games sometimes, when the games were popular and sometimes Susan and Michael were there, but this time, Michael is gone and Susan hangs around different boys, also he went alone. He knew Patrick in the football game. He loves the “Football game”, then he can analyse play-by-play.

Although it’s not clearly said in the novel, Charlie probably has several mental illnesses, including: Asperger's, PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), occasional depression, and perhaps drug(cannabis)-induced psychosis and/or schizophrenia. Before the end of the novel Charlie’s state of mental health deteriorates, because of his emerging PTSD (from the death of aunt Helen) and perhaps psychosis and/or schizophrenia. He is brought to a mental hospital, from which he finally recovers. Early in the book, it is mentioned that Charlie’s best friend Michael appeared to have suffered from depression and had killed himself (before the book). There are several more people in the book who appear to have depression and/or bipolar disorder.

Teenagers, like adults, may decide to take their lives for a variety of reasons. Michael, who was Charlie’s friend, had committed suicide (killed himself) but the reason behind it is never explicitly said in the novel. The school counselor guessed that he might have had "a problem at home" but nobody to talk to, so he felt desperate and lonely. As suicide is a tragic event, it impacted many of the people around him, like Charlie (his best friend) and Susan, (his girlfriend), in addition to the rest of his school. It did, however, help the staff and students become more aware of mental illness in and beyond the school. In addition, it is mentioned in the book that both Bridget and Carl struggled with suicidal thoughts when facing problems in their lives.

This theme appears often in the book, as one of the main characters, Patrick, is homosexual. Patrick is in a relationship with Brad, they are two very different people with very different lives. Brad is one of the most popular boys in school and is dating a girl to cover up his sexuality because he is ashamed of people knowing. Patrick is known by the nickname "Nothing" in school and is bullied often, however that doesn't disturb him at all. In their relationship they go through pain, fear, love, but mostly sorrow. Their whole relationship is told from Charlie's perspective. He explains the phases Patrick goes through and stories he is told throughout their affair. Brad at the beginning had to take drugs and alcohol every time they got together, so that he had something to blame for the next day. Patrick was always very upset about this, however when it finally stopped he wasn't at all bothered that Brad wanted to keep it a secret, as he had deep feelings for him. Things start becoming more complicated when Brad's dad walks in on them. Brad is beat up terribly by his father, which caused him not to come to school for a week and ignore Patrick completely. When Brad comes back to school he calls Patrick "faggot" in the cafeteria, in front of the whole school. This provokes a huge fight, including Brad's friends and Charlie who ends the fight. Brad and Patrick never get back together.

Charlie's family consists of both of his parents, mom and dad, an older brother who is in college and an older sister who is a senior in high school. The family member Charlie is closest with is his mom's sister: aunt Helen. Unfortunately, she died in a car accident on his seventh birthday. Often, Charlie gets flashbacks about her, but he wouldn't understand why it happened. He later realizes after being in the hospital because of a mental breakdown, that his aunt Helen used to sexually abuse of him. Charlie's mom is always home, and does not work. According to Charlie, she is quiet and does not talk much, but when she does everybody listens to her. His dad is considered an honest man by Charlie, he is a hardworking man and a good husband. Since his brother is in college, he loses connection with him, and they don't talk much after that. However Charlie and his brother were never close in that sense. Charlie's relationship with his sister gets worse when he sees her boyfriend hit her. Eventually, Charlie discovers that his sister is pregnant, and he agrees to bring her to an abortion clinic and keep it a secret. She then breaks up with her boyfriend and the relationship between Charlie and her improves. Everybody in Charlie's family is busy and nobody ever has time for him. For that same reason, Charlie feels lonely and sometimes even depressed.

In the book "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" Charlie has a few experiences with drugs, at parties he goes to. Unfortunately, these were all due to bad influences from Patrick since his confusion with finding himself made him try different things.

The book was adapted into a movie in 2012, having Stephen Chbosky direct it and starring Logan Lerman as Charlie, Emma Watson as Sam and Ezra Miller as Patrick. Although the plot of the movie shows many similarities to the novel, it has some clear and distinctive differences. For example, in the movie, Charlie helps Sam with schoolwork to improve her grades, but this is not mentioned in the novel. And the side-story about Charlie’s sister getting pregnant is only in the book, not in the movie.
The movie received mostly positive reviews following its first appearance in theaters, including 85% positive feedback on the website Rotten Tomatoes.

Prime factorization

Prime factorization of any given number is to breakdown the number into its factors until all of its factors are prime numbers. This can be achieved by dividing the given number from smallest prime number and continue it until all its factors are prime.

Example: Prime factorization of number 1729

You should see if the number is divisible by smallest prime numbers, since 1729 isn't divisible by 2, move to next smallest prime number, that is 3, but the remainder is still non zero, next prime numbers are 5,7 and so on, dividing by 7 gives a zero remainder. 

1729 = 7*247, further check if 247 is a prime or not , if its not prime, continue the same steps of prime factorization for 247.

1729 = 7*247 = 7*13*19, Notice that all the factors for the 1729 at this point are prime and no further factors are possible except 1, so further factorization should be stopped.

Royal Rumble (2019) was a show of professional wrestling by WWE that happened in Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona on January 27, 2019 and could be watched on the WWE Network and pay-per-view. Happening after NXT TakeOver: Phoenix and before Worlds Collide, it was the thirty-second Royal Rumble show. WWE has said that 48,193 people were in Chase Field to watch the show, but a wrestling journalist named Dave Meltzer has said that this is not true and that only a little more than 40,000 people were there. Golden Crisp was the sponsor of the show.

Ten matches happened at the show, including three on the pre-show. The last match was the men's Royal Rumble match and it was won by Seth Rollins. Becky Lynch won the women's Royal Rumble match, but lost the first match which was against Asuka for the SmackDown Women's Championship. In other important matches, Brock Lesnar kept the Universal Championship by beating Finn Balor, Daniel Bryan kept the WWE Championship by beating AJ Styles, and Ronda Rousey kept the Raw Women's Championship by beating Sasha Banks.

It has been a tradition for the winner of the Royal Rumble match to get a WrestleMania match for a world championship. This year, the winner of the men's Royal Rumble would get a match at WrestleMania 35 for either the WWE Championship or the Universal Championship or while the winner of the women's would get a match for either the Raw Women's Championship or the SmackDown Women's Championship.

The show had ten matches with three on the pre-show. The matches were organized as part of stories where wrestlers played heroes, villains or somewhere in between. The winners of these matches are chosen by the writers of the stories from WWE.

In December 2018, WWE had a show called where a team called Fabulous Truth (whose members were Carmella and R-Truth beat a team called Mahalicia (whose members were Alicia Fox and Jinder Mahal) in the final of a tournament called the Mixed Match Challenge. For winning the tournament, Carmella would be the last to enter the women's Royal Rumble match, while R-Truth would be the last to enter the men's. For weeks after TLC, there were announcements that several other wrestlers would enter the Royal Rumbles.

At Crown Jewel in November, Brock Lesnar beat Braun Strowman to win the Universal Championship which was not held by anyone before the match. At TLC, Strowman beat Baron Corbin to earn another match against Lesnar for the championship. On the January 14 episode of the weekly WWE show called Raw, Corbin spoke badly about Strowman to him. So, Strowman chased Corbin into a parking lot and then, Corbin hid in a limousine car. Strowman broke the car's glass and door when Vince McMahon, the chairman of WWE, came out and said that it was his car. Mr. McMahon then fined Strowman $100,000. Strowman argued with Mr. McMahon, but Mr. McMahon cancelled the match between Strowman and Lesnar. Later on that episode, Corbin, John Cena, Drew McIntyre, and Finn Balor all said that they wanted to face Lesnar at the Royal Rumble. Mr. McMahon then organized a fatal four-way match between them, but Balor had to fight Jinder Mahal first and the winner would be a part of the fatal four-way. Balor won and then also won the fatal four-way match so he could get a Universal Championship match against Lesnar, but he could not compete in the Royal Rumble anymore.

At TLC, Daniel Bryan beat AJ Styles to keep the WWE Championship. On the January 1 episode of the weekly WWE show called SmackDown, Styles beat Randy Orton, Mustafa Ali, Rey Mysterio, and Samoa Joe in a fatal five-way match to earn another match against Bryan for the championship.

At TLC, Asuka beat Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair in a triple threat Tables, Ladders & Chairs match to win the SmackDown Women's Championship. On the January 1 episode of SmackDown, Lynch, Flair, and Carmella all said that they should face Asuka at the Royal Rumble. Triple H, the COO of WWE, then organized a triple threat match between them. Lynch won so she could get a SmackDown Women's Championship match against Asuka.

At TLC, Ronda Rousey beat Nia Jax to keep the Raw Women's Championship. On the January 7 episode of Raw, Rousey was interviewed by Alexa Bliss on "A Moment of Bliss" and said that she wanted to face Sasha Banks next because she could be a true test to how good Rousey is. Jax interrupted the interview and said that she wanted a rematch with Rousey. Banks then came out and she and Jax organized a match between each other. Banks won so she could get a Raw Women's Championship match against Rousey.

At Crown Jewel, Shane McMahon won the WWE World Cup. He replaced The Miz as a finalist because Miz got into a fight before the final and got injured, so he could not compete. After this, the Miz started asking McMahon to start a tag team with him and said that they could be the best tag team in the world. McMahon eventually agreed to do this. On the January 8 episode of SmackDown, Miz told the Bar (whose members are Cesaro and Sheamus) that he and McMahon wanted a match for their SmackDown Tag Team Championship at the Royal Rumble and the Bar agreed to the match.

On the TLC pre-show, Buddy Murphy beat Cedric Alexander to keep the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. On the December 26, 2018 episode of WWE's weekly show 205 Live (only for Cruiserweights who are wrestlers under 205 pounds), Drake Maverick, the GM of 205 Live, organized a fatal four-way match for Murphy to try to keep his title his title at the Royal Rumble.

The album features guest appearances from Joyner Lucas, Royce da 5'9", Jessie Reyez, and uncredited vocals by Justin Vernon. The album is executively produced by Eminem, credited as Slim Shady, and frequent collaborator Dr. Dre. Production on the album comes from a variety of producers, including Mike Will Made It, Illa da Producer, Ronny J, Cubeatz, Backpack, Boi-1da, Jahaan Sweet, Tay Keith, Tim Suby, LoneStarr Muzik, Fred Ball, S1, Luke Wild, and Luis Resto.

Eminem had previously mentioned working on a song for "Venom" and released the album to streaming music service Spotify without any promotion or announcement on August 31, 2018.

The title track had previously been performed at the 2017 BET Awards.

The cover art is inspired by the Beastie Boys' "Licensed to Ill".

According to review aggregator Metacritic, the album has an average critic review score of 67/100 based on four reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Aja Romano of "Vox" called the album Eminem's best in years, citing a return to the rapper's old school sound after deviating with "Revival". Ed Power of "The Daily Telegraph" also compared this album to "Revival", calling "Kamikaze" a "a high-kicking, low-punching riposte", indicating it is a better release. In "NME", Dan Stubbs gave the album three out of five stars, saying that Eminem is out of step with trends in hip hop by writing, "there's a sense Eminem struggles with the modern world" but stating that "there are plenty of moments... that remind us of Em's greatness". "The Guardian"s Alexis Patridis also gave the album three out of five stars and commented on Eminem's generational difference with current hip hop stars, summing up, "...if you're going to listen to a middle-aged man complain that hip-hop isn't as good as it used to be, that it might as well be Eminem." "The Line of Best Fit"s William Rosebury gave the album 7 of 10 stars and commented that "..."Kamikaze" is the sound of Eminem with his back against the wall, and this has led to some of his most invigorated writing in years—albeit with some troubling lyrical results. Whether he'll be able to maintain this level of energy into his next project is up for debate; for now though, any inspiration is promising. Similarly, A. D. Amorosi of "Variety" sees the album as similar to Eminem's earlier work, stating, "[his] voice hasn't sounded quite so cranky, silly, impassioned or enraged since his early days". In "The Atlantic", Spencer Kornhaber addresses both comparisons with "Revival" and current hip hop stars on "Kamikaze" stating, "Really, though, Eminem is waging a war over aesthetics, and "Kamikaze" is a better listen than "Revival" because its concision confirms Eminem's value as an entertainer... Certainly it's refreshing that in a genre especially obsessed with statements of dominance, Eminem doesn't disguise his feelings of irrelevance. He does, however, try to claim his influence."

In a negative review, "The Hollywood Reporter"s Jonny Coleman considered the album an "epic fail" and described it as "the work of an aging artist trying, and failing, to remain relevant by acting out." In "Billboard", Mikelle Street said "Eminem needs to be held accountable for using homophobic slurs (again)," further adding, "the idea that listeners are too "soft" for critiquing the ways in which rappers weaponize the identities of others against them ignores how hip-hop is a reflection and arbiter of culture."

Five card draw

Five card draw is a popular version of the card game poker. It is generally considered one of the easiest to play and learn, so it is good for newer poker players.

Before any cards are dealt, some of the players will make forced bets. The most common method of forced bets is called "blinds", where two players to the left of the dealer make bets which are called the "Small Blind" and "Big Blind". These forced bets must be at least matched by the other players in order to keep their hands. The big blind is twice as much as the small blind. If the big blind was $1000, then it is said that the blinds are 500 and 1000. This money is put into a place in the center of the table that is called the "pot". The other common forced bet is called an "ante", where every player contributes a small amount to the pot for the right to receive cards. 

Each player is given five cards face down. These are called the player's "Hole Cards" or what the player has "in the hole". Once all the players have their hole cards, the betting starts. If blinds are being used, the player to the left of the Big Blind player starts the betting; if antes are being used, the player to the left of the dealer starts the betting. Players may "Check", or bet nothing, if no player before them in the turn has bet; this is only possible in a game where antes are used. The lowest amount that can be bet is the amount of the big blind or ante. Players can bet more than the minimum if they want. This is called "Raising". If a player raises, the amount he raised the bet to is the new minimum. Each player in turn may either "Call" (pay the current bet amount), Raise, or "Fold" (quit the hand, and give up one's cards into the "muck," the pile of already used cards which won't be used again). This action keeps going around the table until each player has called or folded his hand.

After the first turn of betting is over, each player may swap some of their cards for new ones, which are given by the dealer. This is called "drawing", and the cards that the players gave up are put into the muck. The number of cards that each player can swap varies depending on the agreed rules. The "draw" round begins with the player to left of the dealer and continues clockwise until everyone has drawn, including the dealer. After the draw round, another turn of betting takes place. There is no starting bet in this turn (no blinds) unless a player makes a bet. Players may "Check", or bet nothing, if no player before them in the turn has bet. If everyone checks, or if a player bets and all the others call or fold, then the round of betting is over.

With their five hole cards, the player with the best poker hand wins the round and the pot. If two or more players have the same hand, those players split the pot evenly. If one person bets and all other players have folded, the hand ends then and that player wins; they don't have to show their cards unless they want to.

The following are poker hands, from best to worst:

Southern Ming

Southern Ming was the name of some regimes established by the Ming royal family in southern China after the fall of Beijing, which experienced four emperors and one supervisor. It is seen by many as a continuation of the Ming Dynasty.

In the seventeenth year of Chongzhen (1644), Li Zicheng 's rebellious army captured Beijing, and Zhu Youjian, Emperor Chongzhen, hanged himself in Meishan. When the Qing army entered the Central Plains, most of the imperial families and ministers of the Ming Dynasty fled to the south. They had half of the rivers and mountains south of the Huaihe River to resist the Qing army, including the Hongguang regime, the Lu Kingdom, the Longwu regime, the Shaowu regime, the Yongli regime and the Ming Zheng regimes.

Zhu You Song, the King of Fu, was appointed Emperor of Nanjing and changed his name to Hongguang in 1645. Later, the Qing army descended to the South and besieged Yangzhou. The city of Yangzhou was destroyed and the Qing army slaughtered the people. Historically, it was called "the 10th day of Yangzhou" . Soon after Nanjing fell, Emperor Hongguang was captured.

In 1645, with the support of Zheng Zhilong and others, Zhu Yujian, the King of Tang called himself Emperor in Fuzhou and Longwu in another year. Emperor Longwu launched a short Northern Expedition under the chairmanship of minister Huang Daozhou . At the same time, he joined the peasant rebellion forces to resist the Qing Dynasty. However, with the surrender of Zheng Zhilong to the Qing Dynasty, the situation deteriorated. After being captured, Emperor Longwu died of hunger strike, and the Qing army quickly occupied most of the Southeast.

The rest of the Daxi Army and the bureaucrats of the Ming Dynasty joined forces to support Zhu Youlang , the King of Gui to be emperor in southwest China and changed his name to Yongli. At the same time, Zheng Chenggong attacked the Qing army from both East and west, and the anti-Qing situation reached a climax. However, with the internal strife among the three kings and the attack of the Qing army, the defence line of the Ming army was quickly broken down by the Qing army.

In 1661, Wu Sangui led the Qing Army into Myanmar, and Mangbai, the king of Myanmar, handed over Yongli to the Qing Army. The following April, Yongli and Prince were killed by Wu Sangui in Kunming. After that Zheng Chenggong revered the Ming Dynasty and used Taiwan eastward as a base for resisting the Qing Dynasty and established the Ming and Zheng Dynasty. The Ming Zheng regimes continued to use the Yongli Year, but did not support the Ming Dynasty as emperor or supervisor.

In 1683, when the Qing army occupied Taiwan, Zheng Ke Shuang, King of Yanping, fell to the Qing Dynasty, and Zhu Shugui, King of Ningjing, died by suicide, and the forces of the Ming Dynasty were completely destroyed.

Belle Époque

La Belle Époque (; French for "The Beautiful Era") was a period of Western history. It lasted from the end of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. 

It was a period of optimism, peace, economic prosperity. The colonial empires were well established. There were many technological, scientific, and cultural innovations. The arts flourished in Paris and elsewhere. Many masterpieces of literature, music, theatre, and visual art were created. 

The Belle Époque was named after the event. It was considered a "Golden Age" in contrast to the horrors of World War I. The Belle Epoque was a period in which, according to historian R.R. Palmer, "European civilization achieved its greatest power in global politics, and also exerted its maximum influence upon peoples outside Europe".

In the United Kingdom, the Belle Époque overlapped with the late Victorian era and the Edwardian era in a period known as "Pax Britannica". In Germany, the Belle Époque coincided with the reigns of William I, Frederick III and Wilhelm II. In Italy, with the reigns of Victor Emmanuel II, Umberto I and early of the reign of Victor Emmanuel III. In Russia, with the reigns of Alexander III and Nicholas II. 

In the United States, after the Panic of 1873, the same period was called the Gilded Age (1870s1900s). In Brazil, it started with the end of the Paraguayan War. In Mexico, the period was known as the Porfiriato, and in Japan, it coincided with the Meiji period.

Presidency of Donald Trump

The presidency of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States began with his inauguration on January20, 2017, and ended on January20, 2021.

On November 9, 2016, Republican Donald Trump of New York and Governor Mike Pence of Indiana won the 2016 election, defeating former Democratic secretary of state Hillary Clinton of New York and U.S. senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. Trump won 304 electoral votes compared to Clinton's 227, although Clinton won the popular vote, receiving nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump. Trump then became the fifth person to win the presidency while losing the popular vote. In the congressional elections, Republicans maintained majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

The Trump administration has had record turnover, particularly among White House staff. By the end of his first year in office, 34 percent of Trump's original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned. , 43 percent of senior White House positions had turned over.

On September 5, 2018, "The New York Times" published an article entitled "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration", written by an anonymous senior official in the Trump administration. The author asserted that "many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations."

Trump's presidency was marked by a focus on economic issues, tax reforms, and deregulation. He implemented a conservative agenda, appointed three Supreme Court justices, withdrew from the Paris Agreement on climate change, and engaged in historic meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. However, his tenure was also characterized by controversy, including impeachment proceedings related to his dealings with Ukraine.

In the 2018 mid-term elections, Democrats won control of the House of Representatives, while Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate.

In the 2020 presidential election, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence ran against former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senator Kamala Harris. The president and vice president lost both the electoral college and the popular vote.

This made Trump the first incumbent president since 1992 to lose his re-election bid. Trump and Pence left office on January 20, 2021.

By the end of Trump's first year in office, opinion polls showed him as the least popular United States president since 1945. He said many false and misleading things in his campaign and presidency. Those things were documented by fact-checkers.

Early in his presidency, the Trump administration developed a controversial relationship with mass media. He repeatedly said it was the "fake news". In general, news outlets have made false facts before.

Trump's most repeated false statements were each repeated over 100 times during his presidency. They included that the "Trump wall" was already being built, that a U.S. trade deficit would be a "loss" for the country, and that the American economy was the strongest ever during his administration.

Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy

Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy is a book written by David D. Burns. It was published in 1980. This book made cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) popular.

This forms the current theory that negative feelings such as depression and anxiety are triggered by thoughts.

Four million copies of the book was sold in the United States. It has also been published in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Yugoslavia and many other countries.

The book was the top book recommended by American psychologists and psychiatrists to depressed patients. The book was also mentioned in "50 Psychology Classics" (2006) by Tom Butler-Bowdon.

Six different studies suggests that "Feeling Good" is a personal guide to bibliotherapy. The therapy is very helpful in treating depression. 

One of the studies was conducted with older adults with mild to moderate depression. The reading of "Feeling Good" was an effective treatment for them.

Judith S. Beck "Cognitive Therapy" recommends the book as an easy CBT guide for patients.

Johannes de Sacrobosco claimed that from 45 BC to 8 BC, the February had 30 days in leap year. In 8 BC, Augustus added 31 days in August. It made the February shorter.

In 1700, Sweden tried to change their Julian calendar date to Gregorian calendar date by removing all leap years from 1700. However, the 1704 and 1708 became leap days by mistake. So Sweden added 2 leap days in February 1712 to match their dates with the Julian calendar. They changed to Gregorian calendar in 1753 by removing the 11 days from February.

Many sources claimed that from 1929 to 1940, the Soviet Union used a new calendar. It had 5-6 weeks and 30 days each month. Other 5 days were holidays in the calendar, just like the French Republican Calendar.

After three weeks of continued attack on the castle Colonel Lavington and his Roundhead team dug seventy meters underneath Castle Hill, where the castle is. He knew that the Cavaliers stored gunpowder in the church so he wanted to blow it up. The tunnel was never completed as the Royalists surrendered on April 26, 1646. It is now deemed "unsafe" to enter the tunnel and surrounding dwellings.

Electronic signature

An electronic signature is an electronic record of an agreement.

Contracts have been used for a long time to show that two parties agree on something. Often these parties will then write a document that they both sign to show this agreement. In the times of the internet, many of these documents are transmitted in digital form, but showing agreement is still needed. That is where an electronic signature comes in. 

The concept of electornic sgnature itself is not new. Common law jurisdictions have recognized telegraph signatures as far back as the mid-19th century, and faxed signatures since the 1980s. 

Electronic signatures exist in different forms. All forms can show that somebody agreed with something. Some forms can also protect the data the person agreed with from being changed easily, or they can legally identify the person that agreed. To do this, ideas from public-key cryptography are used: digital signatures, certificates, and hash codes. An electronic signature often includes a timestamp to show when the signature was made. Much like cryptography, electronic signatures can be used for any kind of data, there is no requirement that the data signed has a specific format. 

Even though cryptography is often used, the term electronic signature has a legal meaning. This is different from the technical term digital signature used in cryptography. Many countries have made regulations so that some electronic signatures are equivalent to a handwritten signature for many purposes. 

There are different ways in which an electronic signature can be done. Many countries have standards as to what such a signature must look like. Examples for such regulations are eIDAS in the European Union, NIST-DSS in the United States or ZertES in Switzerland.

For an electronic signature to be considered as advanced, it must meet the following requirements:

A qualified electronic signature is an electronic signature that is compliant to EU Regulation No 910/2014 (eIDAS Regulation) for electronic transactions within the internal European market. It enables to verify the authorship of a declaration in electronic data exchange over long periods of time. Qualified electronic signatures can be considered as digital equivalent to handwritten signatures.

Qualified electronic signatures use digital certificates, which are issued by accredited certification authorities. The certtificate and key are stored securely, usually on a smart card. To access the data on the smart card, the user must autenticate himself or herself, usually with a password or piece of biometric data. The certification authority also checked that the user is who he pretends to be, usually cross-checking with an official, state-issued document.

In addition to the points listed under "addvanced electronic signature", a qualified electronic signature also legally identifies the signer. before the authorities.

Planck (spacecraft)

Planck was a space observatory operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) from 2009 to 2013.

It mapped the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at microwave and infra-red frequencies, with high sensitivity and small angular resolution.

The mission improved on observations made by the NASA Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). "Planck" provided a major source of information about cosmology and astrophysics. It tested theories of the early Universe and the origin of cosmic structure.

Since the end of its mission, "Planck" has made the most precise measurements of several key numbers. These include the average density of ordinary matter and dark matter in the Universe, and the age of the universe. Planck is now switched off.

Serotiny

The longest-lasting character in Detective Comics was Batman: from the time of his debut (#27, May 1939), the Caped Crusader was almost always the star of the cover and lead story.

Detective Comics has remained in publication longer than any other DC Comics title, and indeed, the very name DC was taken from its initials. However, since Action Comics was published weekly for a short time in the 1980s, and Detective was bi-monthly for a period in the 1970's, Action had a higher issue count (until January 2020, when both titles were up to issue #1019). Nonetheless, in March 2019, Detective became only the third American comic book in history - after Action and the Four Color series of the 1930s-60s by Dell Comics - to publish a 1,000th issue. In 2011, as part of The New 52 reboot, Detective's numbering was reset to #1 and a "Volume 2" launched. However, in 2016 the legacy numbering was restored, allowing the comic to reach the milestone.

<poem lang="fr" style="float:left;">Un député du Peuple
1. La victoire en chantant
Nous ouvre la barrière.
La Liberté guide nos pas.
Et du Nord au Midi
La trompette guerrière
A sonné l'heure des combats.
Tremblez ennemis de la France
Rois ivres de sang et d'orgueil.
Le Peuple souverain s'avance,
Tyrans descendez au cercueil.

Chant des guerriers (Refrain)
La République nous appelle
Sachons vaincre ou sachons périr
Un Français doit vivre pour elle
Pour elle un Français doit mourir.
Un Français doit vivre pour elle
Pour elle un Français doit mourir.

Une mère de famille
2. De nos yeux maternels ne craignez pas les larmes :
Loin de nous de lâches douleurs!
Nous devons triompher quand vous prenez les armes:
C'est aux rois à verser des pleurs.
Nous vous avons donné la vie,
Guerriers, elle n'est plus à vous;
Tous vos jours sont à la patrie:
Elle est votre mère avant nous.

Deux vieillards
3. Que le fer paternel arme la main des braves;
Songez à nous au champ de Mars;
Consacrez dans le sang des rois et des esclaves
Le fer béni par vos vieillards;
Et, rapportant sous la chaumière
Des blessures et des vertus,
Venez fermer notre paupière
Quand les tyrans ne seront plus.

Un enfant
4. De Barra, de Viala le sort nous fait envie ;
Ils sont morts, mais ils ont vaincu.
Le lâche accablé d'ans n'a point connu la vie:
Qui meurt pour le peuple a vécu.
Vous êtes vaillants, nous le sommes:
Guidez-nous contre les tyrans;
Les républicains sont des hommes,
Les esclaves sont des enfants.

Une épouse
5. Partez, vaillants époux; les combats sont vos fêtes;
Partez, modèles des guerriers;
Nous cueillerons des fleurs pour en ceindre vos têtes:
Nos mains tresserons vos lauriers.
Et, si le temple de mémoire
S'ouvrait à vos mânes vainqueurs,
Nos voix chanterons votre gloire,
Nos flancs porteront vos vengeurs.

Une jeune fille
6. Et nous, sœurs des héros, nous qui de l'hyménée
Ignorons les aimables nœuds;
Si, pour s'unir un jour à notre destinée,
Les citoyens forment des vœux,
Qu'ils reviennent dans nos murailles
Beaux de gloire et de liberté,
Et que leur sang, dans les batailles,
Ait coulé pour l'égalité.

Trois guerriers
7. Sur le fer devant Dieu, nous jurons à nos pères,
À nos épouses, à nos sœurs,
À nos représentants, à nos fils, à nos mères,
D'anéantir les oppresseurs:
En tous lieux, dans la nuit profonde,
Plongeant l'infâme royauté,
Les Français donneront au monde
Et la paix et la liberté.

1. Victory singing
Opens for us the gates
Liberty guides our steps
And from the North to the South
The war trumpet
Signals the hour of the fight
Tremble, enemies of France
Kings drunk on blood and pride
The sovereign People comes forth
Tyrants go down to your graves.

Song of the Warriors (Chorus)
The Republic is calling us
Let us prevail or let us perish
A Frenchman must live for her
For her a Frenchman must die
A Frenchman must live for her
For her a Frenchman must die.

A mother of a family
2. Do not fear that our motherly eyes should weep
From us begone, cowardly grief!
We must triumph when you bear arms
It is kings who have to weep
We gave you life
Warriors, it is no longer yours
All your days belong to the Motherland
It is your mother above all.

Two old men
3. May the fatherly iron arm, the hand of the braves
Think of us on the Field of Mars
Bless with the blood of the kings and of the slaves
the arms blessed by your elder
And bringing back home
wounds and virtues
come and close our lids
when tyrants are no more.

A child
4. The fates of Barra and Viala fill us with envy
They died, but they prevailed
The coward plagued with years never experienced life
He who dies for the People has lived
You are brave, we are too
Guide us against Tyrants
Republicans are men
Slaves are children.

A wife
5. Leave, valiant husbands! Battles are your feasts
Leave, models for warriors
We shall pick flowers to crown your heads
Our hands shall braid laurels
And if the temple of memory
Should open for your victorious manes
Our voices shall sing your glory
Our wombs shall bear your avengers.

A young girl
6. And we, sister of the heroes, we who of Hymenaios
ignore the loveable knots
if, for uniting themselves some day with our destiny
a citizen would express the wish
let them come back in our walls
embellished with glory and liberty
and that their blood, in battles
would have been spilled for equality.

Three warriors
7. On the iron, before God, we swear to our fathers
to our wives, to our sisters
to our representatives, to our sons, to our mothers
that we shall annihilate oppressors
Everywhere, into the deep night
by sinking the infamous royalty
the French shall give to the world
peace and liberty.

Work hardening

The work hardening, also known as strain hardening, is the strengthening of a metal or polymer by plastic deformation. The plastic deformation of the metals is made below the recrystallization temperature. In most cases, such cold forming is done at room temperature. The major cold-working operations can be classified basically as squeezing (rolling), bending, shearing and drawing.

The cold-working process uses the pressure and speed of a mechanical or hydraulic press. The press takes a metal ‘blank’ and shapes it using a ‘punch’ and ‘die’ set. Basically, the punch is the tool used for shaping, and the ‘die’ is the clamp that holds the metal. When these metals are cold worked, permanent defects change their crystalline makeup. These defects reduce the ability of crystals to move within the metal structure and the metal becomes more resistant to further deformation. The resulting metal product has improved tensile strength and hardness, but less ductility.

Cold working can be used on a variety of metals, including aluminum, copper, brass, steel, and stainless steel.

Phase-locked loop

In electronics, a phase-locked loop is a type of circuit where the output keeps a known phase relationship with the input. If the output begins to lose this relationship, then the electronics will correct it until the output is returned to the correct phase again. When the phase of an output is steady, then the phase is locked. Each time the phase is measured, the electronics will correct any deviation of the output. A loop is created which continually corrects the signal.

Quicksort

Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that is used to sort items in an array. It was created by Tony Hoare in 1959, and it is still widely used today. Quicksort splits the array into two parts, and then continues to split those parts into more parts, and sorting along the way. It sorts by using a comparison sort. This means that it chooses a pivot point in a part of the array and then compares it with all the other points in that part of the array.


Often the leftmost item is chosen as the pivot. The recursion means that the algorithm runs the same exact algorithm on the two partitions that were created by the comparisons to the pivot. Note that this algorithm will keep on partitioning the array into subarrays, and splitting those subarrays into even smaller subarrays. Each time it does this, it will choose a new pivot within the subarray and compare the items to the subarray. The base case is when the algorithm reaches a subarray with only one item, in which it just stops because one item does not need to be sorted.

Sancho VI of Navarre

Sancho Garcés VI (; 21 April 1132 - 27 June 1194), called the Wise (, ) was King of Navarre from 1150 until his death in 1194. He was the first monarch to officially drop the title of "King of Pamplona" in favour of King of Navarre. With this action, he also changed the name of his kingdom. Sancho Garcés was responsible for bringing his kingdom into the political orbit of Europe. He was the eldest son of García Ramírez, "the Restorer" and Margaret of L'Aigle.

Sancho VI inherited a debilitated kingdom, subject of frequent raids by the Kingdom of Castile of Alfonso VII and by the County of Barcelona of Ramon Berenguer IV, also king of Aragon, who in 1140 had agreed the partition of the kingdom in the Treaty of Carrión.

He tried to repair the borders of his kingdom, which had been reduced by the Treaties of Tudején and Carrión, which he had been forced to sign with Castile and Aragón in his early reign. By the Accord of Soria, Castile was eventually confirmed in its possession of conquered territories. In the face of a possible Castilian military takeover of further western Navarrese territories, Sancho VI re-asserted royal authority by founding several towns in 1181, including San Sebastián, Vitoria and Treviño, among others.

He was hostile to Count Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona, but Raymond's son King Alfonso II of Aragon divided the lands taken from Murcia with him by treaty of Sangüesa in 1168. In 1190, the two neighbours again signed a pact in Borja of mutual protection against Castilian expansion.

He died on 27 June 1194, in Pamplona, where he is buried.

Channel catfish

The channel catfish ("Ictalurus punctatus"), also called the channel cat, is a species of catfish. It's the official fish of several US states, which are Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee. In the US, it is the most fished catfish species. 

It has also been introduced in Europe, Asia and South America, and it's legally considered an invasive species in many countries.

These fish have a very keen sense of smell and taste. At the pits of their nostrils are sensitive odor-sensing organs with a high concentration of olfactory receptors.

The barbels of a channel catfish don't actually sting. This is believed by most people to be false. However, these catfish do have spines on their pectoral and dorsal fins. If you do not handle these properly, you'll most likely have injury.

Channel catfish have a top-end size of about 40–50 pounds (18–23 kg). The record-breaking channel cat weighed 58 pounds, and was caught in the Santee-Cooper Reservoir in South Carolina, on July 7, 1964. As channel catfish grow longer, they increase in weight.

Channel catfish have a lot of taste perception, hence called the swimming tongue, due to the presence of taste buds all over the external body surface and inside the oropharyngeal cavity.

This fish is adapted to limited light conditions. Members of the genus "Ictalurus" do not depend solely on visual cues.

Channel catfish can communicate to predators. Pectoral stridulation has been considered to be the main means of agonistic communication towards predators in channel catfish. Relatively noisy sounds are used to startle and scare predators in a manner analogous to the well-documented, visual flash display of various lepidopterans.
The utricle is the primary area of hearing in most fishes (in this case, the channel catfish). The hearing ability is enhanced by the presence of the swim bladder. It is the part that reverberates the echo from other’s sounds.

The "Bombus lapidarius" usually emerges in early spring and hibernates from around august to march. A male or drone has a yellow head and a squared off tail whereas the female has a rounder tail and a black head. The bee lives nearly all over the globe and is most commonly found in Europe. They have a reasonably mild temprament and do not sting unless they feel threatened. They collect nectar from wildflowers such as heather and daisies. "Bombus lapidarius" lay their eggs in tubes and holes and cover the entrance with soil and leaf litter to hinder predators. The larvae chew through this layer and emerge as small bees. The "Bombus lapidarius" can live for up to 3 years depending on weather conditions.

Dungan people

The Dungan people are ethnic Muslims that came from from China who live in regions of the former Soviet Union and Xinjiang. Their ancestors are the Hui people in China. Russians and Turkic-speaking peoples call them Dungan, but the Dungan call themselves Hui because that is what their ancestors called themselves. 

The Dungan language came from Mandarin Chinese, and it is most like the dialects in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces in China. The Dungan call their language the Hui language. Like Chinese, it is a tonal language. However, it is different from Chinese because it uses some words that are no longer used in Chinese dialects today. There are also many Arabic and Persian loanwords. Unlike Chinese, it is written using Cyrillic instead of Chinese characters.

Cyclopropane

Cyclopropane is the cycloalkane molecule with the formula , with three carbon atoms connected to each other in a ring structure, and each carbon atom being connected to two hydrogen atoms. The ring is very small, and ring strain can take place because of this.

Cyclopropane is an anesthetic, meaning inhaling large quantities of the gas form that evaporates can send somebody to sleep, however today, other chemicals are used by medical professionals. It is also very reactive, and can explode when mixed with oxygen.

Cyclohexane

Cyclohexane is the cycloalkane molecule with the formula , with 6 carbon atoms connected to each other in a ring shape, and each connected to two hydrogen atoms. It is used when making adipic acid and caprolactam, which can them be used to make nylon. It has no color and is flammable.

Dungan language

The Dungan language is the native language of the Dungan people, a ethnic group living in regions of the former Soviet Union and Xinjiang who are descendants of Hui people. The Dungan call their own language the Hui language. It is a daughter language of Mandarin Chinese based on Gansu and Shaanxi dialects, and speakers of both dialects can largely understand each other. This is called mutual intelligibilty. Like Chinese, it is both tonal and analytic. However, differences between Dungan and Chinese are that Dungan is written in Cyrillic instead of Chinese characters and there are differences in vocabulary. Dungan has more Arabic and Persian loanwords and several terms are no longer used in Standard Chinese.

Analytic language

An analytic language is a language that organizes words and grammar by a strict word order instead of inflections, or word endings that show grammar. Examples of analytic languages include Chinese, English, Vietnamese, Thai, Khmer, and Lao. 

In Chinese, sentences are mostly in the SVO (subject-verb-object) word order. So the sentence must be "I eat noodles", not "I noodles eat" or "eat I noodles". In Chinese this is written as 我吃面条. The verb 吃 (pronounced "chī," meaning: "eat") does not change based on the subject "I" or the object "noodles", and likewise the subject 我 (pronounced "wǒ," meaning: "I") and object 面条 (pronounced "miàntiáo," meaning: "noodle/noodles") do not have any special word endings based on its role or number. What is important is that all the words are in the correct order. 

Modern English does have some inflections based on the subject (the verb "eat" becomes "eats" when the subject is a third person "he/she/it") and number ("noodle" is singular while "noodles" is plural), but aside from that, there are almost none. Therefore, Modern English is mostly an analytic language. Modern English has far fewer inflections that almost all other Indo-European languages, such as Spanish, German, and Russian. 

Old English was an inflectional language and content words could have several different word endings, much like German today. However, England was taken over by speakers of other languages, especially French, Danish, and Latin, and since the new rulers became second language speakers of English, the grammar simplified to what it is today.

Sprachbund

A sprachbund is a group of languages spoken in the same area. They become similar because the speakers live close to each other. They constantly communicate with each other. Because similarities in the languages develop, they sometimes seem to be in the same language family.

For example, in India, where there are hundreds or thousands of languages and dialects spoken, the languages often adopt similar grammar structures, vocabulary, and sounds. Indians often communicate with people who have a different first language from themselves.

In East Asia, since China introduced writing to nearby countries, especially Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. This area is called the sinosphere, or the Chinese sphere of influence. Not only did speakers of East Asian languages learn to by write using Chinese characters, but they also borrowed many loanwords from Chinese as well.

Linguists used to believe that languages like Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Turkish, and Finnish were part of the Altaic language family. This was because of similar features like SVO (subject-verb-object) word order and agglutinating grammar. However, most linguists no longer believe that the Altaic language family ever existed. The languages became more similar over time, whereas most related languages become more different over time. It is possible that these languages are part of a sprachbund.

East Asian cultural sphere

The East Asian cultural sphere, Sinosphere, or Chinese sphere of influence, is a region in Asia that has many influences from Chinese culture. These including the use of Chinese characters, clothing, art, food, inventions, social structures, government structures, religious ideas, and many other influences. The area is made of the Greater China region (mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), Japan, Korea, Singapore, and sometimes Mongolia and Vietnam (depending on who you ask). Since China had a very large trade network, it was able to easily share its goods and ideas across Eurasia, and especially its neighboring countries in East Asia.

At one point, all the countries wrote only using Chinese characters, but nowadays, only Chinese and Japanese speakers write using Chinese characters in everyday life. All the other countries either created a new writing system (Korea and Mongolia), or replaced Chinese characters with a different, already existing writing system (Mongolia, again, and Vietnam). Nonetheless, the languages of each country still have many Chinese loanwords.

Greater China

Greater China is a name sometimes used for all the regions that both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) claim (though may not not completely control). This includes Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. The PRC controls mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, while the ROC controls Taiwan. Each of these regions have their own passport, currency, travel rules, labor laws, and constitutions. General Secretary Xi Jinping added Xi Jinping Thought into the Communist Party's constitution during the Communist Party of China's 19th Congress (the 19th time it held elections), and one part of it says that all of China must reunite as one country.

Waccabuc is a hamlet and lake in the town of Lewisboro, Westchester County, New York. Waccabuc is known as "New York's Secret Suburb". Waccabuc is known by many outside of the town for its Castle Rock.

Chinese loanwords

Chinese loanwords are loanwords borrowed into non-Chinese languages, especially East Asian languages. Since China introduced writing to the Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese languages, each language had also borrowed many Chinese loanwords. Since all the languages have very different sound systems from each other, they all have different systems for pronouncing Chinese loanwords (though there are many words that sound similar to each other). These are called Sino-Xenic pronunciations. These are similar to how loanwords from Latin and French sound differently when spoken in English. 

At one point, all these languages only wrote in Chinese characters. Today, Japanese is the only non-Chinese language that writes in Chinese characters in everyday life. Chinese characters, or "kanji" in Japanese, can be used to write both native Japanese words and Chinese loanwords. Today, Korean uses Chinese characters, or "hanja" in Korean, only for Chinese loanwords (when writing only in hangul is too ambiguous) and writing out one's own name. Today, Vietnamese does not use Chinese characters at all, but only uses the Latin alphabet, or "chữ Quốc ngữ" in Vietnamese. Chinese characters are only used as a decoration in Vietnam today, and they are studied by only a few Vietnamese.

This chart will compare the pronunciations of Chinese vocabulary terms in Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese.

Absolute space and time

Absolute space and time are concepts used by Aristotle and by Newton. They are still used in classical mechanics. Even in Newtonian mechanics, the notion of inertial frame of reference is used.

The concepts of space and time were separate before special relativity theory, which connected the two. It showed both to be dependent upon the reference frame's motion. In Einstein's theories, the ideas of absolute time and space were replaced by the idea of spacetime in special relativity, and curved spacetime in general relativity.

NationStates

NationStates is a website and browser based game and online community. It is about creating and managing a nation. It was created on 13 November 2002 by Max Barry. He created the game to advertise his book, "Jennifer Government". The game does not cost money to play, however people can donate money to remove adverts. They can also buy bonuses related to "telegrams", which are the way that players talk to each other directly.

Registration is free and users are asked to provide the name of their nation, a national motto, a national animal, and a currency. After playing for a few months, players can also modify their government type and religion, leader, etc. Players can upload or choose a flag for their nation. 

There is a forum in the game, where players can chat about whatever they like, whether it be politics, recent events, etc. There are three major categories: General, which is for "discussion and debate about anything", Forum 7, where you can "relax, unwind, share a joke, and generally goof off," and NationStates, where users can "come together and discuss matters of varying importance". 

Players are able to create and manage "regions", which are communities for players. Each region has a "Regional Message Board", which acts as a type of forum. Each region is managed by its "founder" (the player who created the region), but players within the region can also choose a "World Assembly Delegate". The World Assembly (WA) is an organisation and part of the game acting as a stand in for the United Nations. It makes laws that apply to nations that have joined the WA but nations are not required to be a member. It used to be called "The United Nations", however Max Barry was sent an email by the United Nations telling him to not use their trademark in his game.

Players are also able to create factbook and dispatches about their country, which they can use to tell other people about their country.

Repository (data)

A repository is a way of storing information related to a file system. For version control software (VCS), it is used to store information about files, their size, date of creation, and any changes made to them (often called "commits"). Common examples of software that use repositories are Git and Mercurial, but others do exist.

A repository can be stored on a person's computer "locally" (not on the internet), but it can also be stored "remotely" (on a network or the internet). One of the most popular websites for hosting repositories is GitHub, however others such as GitLab exist. If a person wants to use a public repository on these kinds of websites, they can "clone" the repository onto their computer. This creates a copy of the repository, and all of the files (usually computer code) related to it. A person can then make changes to the repository, and they can "commit" those changes to their local repository (which means that their changes are recorded in the repository's history). If they wish to update the remote repository (the one stored online) they can "push" their changes to it. This updates the repository on the website or network location.

Discord (software)

Discord is a free instant messaging software that lets people talk to each other over the internet. It was originally meant for people who play video games, but is now used by others. In addition to text messaging, you may also make audio and video calls through Discord. Discord is free to use, and it runs on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and in most web browsers it can also be used on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and Series S and Xbox One consoles but only the Voice Chat function is available and must be started from the main app. It is used by 350 million people, 150 million people use it every month.

Selma to Montgomery marches

The marches from Selma to Montgomery, led President Lyndon B. Johnson to sign the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The first March occurred on March 7, 1965 and became known as Bloody Sunday. Between 500-600 civil rights protesters began the march on March 7 but were stopped by Sheriff Jim Clark. The Sheriff of Dallas County (where Selma is located) ordered that all white men over the age of 21 should report to the court house steps where he made them deputies and equipped them to counter the protesters. They were joined by state troopers and beat protesters so severely that 17 were hospitalized. They beat the protesters with batons, fired tear gas into the crowd, and charged them from horseback. 

Amelia Boynton, who had helped organize the march as well as marching in it, was beaten unconscious. A photograph of her lying on the road of the Edmund Pettus Bridge appeared on the front page of newspapers and news magazines around the world. 17 marchers were hospitalized and 50 treated for lesser injuries. 

The executive board of the NAACP unanimously passed a resolution the day after "Bloody Sunday", warning, 
If Federal troops are not made available to protect the rights of Negroes, then the American people are faced with terrible alternatives. Like the citizens of Nazi-occupied France, Negroes must either submit to the heels of their oppressors or they must organize underground to protect themselves from the oppression of Governor Wallace and his storm troopers.
After the events were televised, President Johnson issued an order mobilizing the Alabama National Guard to protect the marchers on their 54 mile (87 km) journey from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. This second march would start on March 21, 1965 and end on March 25, 1965 at the steps of the state capitol in Montgomery, Alabama. Before the second march even began President Johnson went to congress to ask them for a bill that would guarantee voting rights for all citizens and end discrimination at polling places (such as poll taxes and literacy tests).

Dupont Plaza Hotel arson

The Dupont Plaza Hotel arson was an act of arson on New Year's Eve 1986. The fire was set by three former employees of the hotel. They were involved in a labor dispute with the owners. 

Ninety-eight people were killed in the fire and by breathing in smoke.

The Dupont Plaza opened in 1963 as the Puerto Rico-Sheraton. It was operated by the Sheraton hotel company until 1980. That was just before Sheraton put up major fire-safety measures in its hotels.

The employees' union called a meeting in the hotel's ballroom for the afternoon of December 31, 1986. At the end of the meeting, around 3:00 pm, the 125 members present voted to go on strike starting at midnight.

Three union members-Héctor Escudero Aponte, José Rivera López and Arnaldo Jiménez-planned setting several fires. They wanted to scare tourists who stayed at the hotel. At around 3:30 pm that afternoon, they placed opened cans of chafing fuel in a storage room with newly bought furniture. The three men then set the fuel on fire.

The fire quickly burned out of control. It grew very large as the building burned. 

An investigation by the United States' Occupational Safety and Health Administration found 25 safety violations. They included not having emergency exit doors in the casino area. That caused the deaths of 84 trapped guests. 

In April 1987, Escuerdo Apante, 35, Jiménez Rivera, 29, and José Francisco Rivera López, 40, pleaded guilty to setting the New Year's Eve fire. They were also convicted of murder in the disaster. Two of the men were later released from federal prison.

Communist Party of Cuba

The Communist Party of Cuba is the ruling political party in Cuba. It is a Marxist–Leninist communist party. The Cuban constitution describes the role of the party to be the "leading force of society and of the state". Since April 2021, the First Secretary of the Central Committee has been Miguel Díaz-Canel. The Second Secretary has been José Ramón Machado Ventura.

Cuba had a number of communist and anarchist organizations from the early period of the Republic. The original "internationalised" Communist Party of Cuba formed in the 1920s. In 1944, it was renamed as the Popular Socialist Party for electoral reasons. In July 1961, two years after the successful overthrow of Fulgencio Batista and the creation of a revolutionary government, the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (ORI) was formed. It was a merger of:

On 26 March 1962, the ORI became the United Party of the Cuban Socialist Revolution (PURSC), which became the Communist Party of Cuba on 3 October 1965. In Article 5 of the Cuban constitution of 1976, the Communist Party is recognized as "the superior guiding force of society and of the State, that organizes and orients common efforts toward the high goals of the construction of socialism and the advancement toward communist society". All parties, including the Communist Party, are prohibited from advertizing their organizations.

For the first fifteen years of its existence, the Communist Party was almost completely inactive outside of the Politburo. The 100 person Central Committee rarely met and the first regular party Congress was held ten years after its founding. In 1969, membership of the party was only 55,000 (0.7% of the population), making the PCC the smallest ruling communist party in the world. By the time of the first party Congress in 1975, the party had grown to just over two hundred thousand members. By 1980, the party had grown to over 430,000 members and it grew further to 520,000 by 1985.

The leading bodies of the party were the Politburo and the Secretariat until 1991. In 1991 the two bodies were merged into an expanded Politburo with over twenty members. However, the Secretariat was re-introduced in 2002. There is also a Central Committee which meets between party congresses. At the Fifth Congress, the size of the Central Committee was reduced to 150 members from the previous membership of 225. Fidel Castro was the party's First Secretary (or leader) since its creation while Raúl Castro was the Second Secretary. Upon Fidel Castro's 2008 resignation from the party and Cuban government, Raúl Castro became First Secretary.

The 8th Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba was elected by the Central Committee following the 8mth Congress.
The Communist Party of Cuba has a youth wing, the Young Communist League ("Unión de Jóvenes Comunistas", UJC) which is a member organization of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. It also has a children's group, the José Martí Pioneer Organization.

Compared with other ruling Communist Parties, the Communist Party of Cuba retains a stricter adherence to the tradition of Marxism–Leninism and the traditional Soviet model.

José Ramón Machado Ventura

José Ramón Machado Ventura, M.D. (born 26 October 1930) is a Cuban revolutionary and politician who was the First Vice President of the Council of State of Cuba from 2008 to 2013. Raúl Castro was elected as the President of Cuba on 24 February 2008. Machado was elected to succeed him as First Vice President. He has been Second Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba since 2011.

Popular Socialist Party (Cuba)

The Popular Socialist Party (, PSP) was a communist party in Cuba. It was originally called the Communist Party of Cuba (). It was formed in 1925 by a group including Blas Roca, Anibal Escalante, Fabio Grobart, Alfonso Bernal del Riesgo and Julio Antonio Mella, who was its leader until his assassination in Mexico in 1929. It was later renamed the "Communist Revolutionary Union". After the electoral victory of the Partido Auténtico in the 1944 elections, the party became less popular, and it eventually adopted the name "Popular Socialist Party" for electoral reasons. In 1961 the party merged into the Integrated Revolutionary Organizations (ORI). 

Almendares River

The Almendares River is a 45 km river in the western part of Cuba. It originates from the east of Tapaste and flows north-west into the Straits of Florida. The river is a water supply for Havana.

The river divides two districts of Havana: the Plaza de la Revolución (Miramar) and Playa (Vedado). Part of the river valley forms the Almendares Park or Metropolitan Park of Havana (PMH), a few kilometers upstream from the ocean.

There are several industrial plants along the river banks (paper mills, gas production plants, brewery, food production plants, construction plants).

The Havana authorities continue to monitor and control water pollution, reduce and rationalize
industrial occupation, maintain the old trees and the vegetation in the park. The area is gradually becoming a green oasis with playground, a few restaurants and footpaths.

Tamakeri

Tamakeri (玉蹴り) (literally ball kicking) or ballbusting is one of many more specific sexual fetishes in the BDSM community. Somebody with this fetish enjoys either hitting a man in the testicles, or being hit in the testicles. This is also referred to as ballbusting ("bb" for short). Tamakeri is the Japanese term, but it is used by many non-Japanese people to describe media where Asian women hit men in the testicles. In tamakeri, there are two types of people: the sadist and the masochist. The sadist hits the man in the testicles, and the masochist is hit in the testicles. The fetish is popular among straight and gay men and women. Since the Internet was created, the amount of people watching tamakeri pornography has gone up, with at least 1,269,105 people looking at popular websites. In hentai communities, it can be called "tamakeri", or "crotch_kick".

The first tamakeri/ballbusting websites to show up on the internet were Velvet Kick, Tamahimeden, Spikey Step, Stardeck9, and Femaledom. Most of their videos had bad quality, didn't make money, had no stories, and had regular people with masks performing.

After the first websites came ones like British Bitches, Vuneraballs, M-Club-Q, Kinkeri.co.jp, USBBonline, Goddess-Kicks, Ballbusting Universe, and Ballbustingworld. These sites had better quality, more money, more content, stories, and known actors that didn't wear masks. Even though the majority of videos had known porn actors, many still decided to wear masks.

The current tamakeri websites have videos made by normal people, paid actors, and videos taken at events. Because these new websites are larger, more people can post their own videos. Also, chatrooms and forums allow people to discuss the fetish with others. Some examples of this latest tamakeri wave include ClubDom, Ballbustingtube, Ballbustingchicks, clips4sale, kickedinthegroin.ning.com, Scaffies.nl, Tamakeri.nl and ProtectUrNuts.com.

People enjoy tamakeri because they either feel good feeling pain or making others feel it. The feeling is like a "runner's high", where feel-good hormones called endorphins are sent out by the body. These endorphins make the people involved feel sexually aroused. But some people say that threats and more painful kicks or knees to the testicles by the female (in straight people) makes people more aroused. Belonging to a dominant boyfriend or girlfriend can also be a "turn-on". Like a lot of BDSM activities, it can be risky, and those involved can get hurt.

Fountain pen

A fountain pen is a pen which has a nib and a reservoir of ink. 

The pen draws ink from the reservoir through a feed to the nib.The ink travels by a combination of gravity and capillary action. The nib is the part of the pen that writes on the paper. Different shapes and styles of nibs can change the amount of ink distributed and the thickness of your writing line. Most fountain pens have replaceable nibs. They can come in many different materials and styles and are ranked from extra-fine to extra broad. 

Filling the reservoir with ink may be done manually, by a Pasteur pipette (eyedropper) or syringe. However, usually it is done by an internal filling mechanism which creates suction. A piston mechanism or a vacuum transfers ink directly through the nib into the reservoir. Some pens have removable reservoirs in the form of pre-filled ink cartridges. 

According to Mathur "the modern fountain pen nib may be traced back to the original gold nib which had a tiny fragment of ruby attached to form the wear-point". Nibs tipped with platinum group alloys such as iridium have been used since the 1830s. Today, the main part of the nib are usually made of stainless steel and/or gold The most popular gold content is 14 carat (58⅓%) and 18 carat (75%). The idea is that the nib should be flexible yet firm, and the tip extremely hard-wearing.

Until the early 20th century, the ink in a fountain pen was kept directly in the barrel. The slim barrels were made of hard rubber, which came in two colours, black and red. Ink was put in these barrels with an eye-dropper. To do this, the user had to take off the nib section, put the ink in and replace the nib section. This operation required a quiet secluded place, which some people might not have.

In 1907, Walter A. Sheaffer patented the lever filler. This used a hinged lever set into the pen barrel which pressed down onto a bar which in turn compressed a rubber sac inside, creating a vacuum which pulled ink into the pen. This could be done without removing the nib section.

Introduced in 1912, this innovation was rapidly imitated by the other major pen makers. Parker introduced the button filler, which had a button hidden beneath a blind cap on the end of the barrel. When pressed, it acted on a pressure bar inside to depress the ink sac. Many other firms used a lever set flat along the barrel, which, when pulled, squeezed the rubber sac. It was the rubber sac which made all the difference between the founain pens of the 19th century and those of the 20th century. Other firms used a screw mechanism at the top end of the pen to squeeze the rubber sac.

Christchurch mosque shootings

The Christchurch mosque shootings were two terrorist mass shootings on 15 March 2019 at the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand during Friday prayers. At least 51 people were killed and 40 others injured by gunman Brenton Tarrant in the shootings. It was described as a terrorist attack by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

Police have also confirmed that they had found multiple car bombs, which were successfully disarmed. This was the first mass shooting in New Zealand since the 1997 Raurimu massacre.

Australian Brenton Tarrant was arrested and charged with murder. Tarrant live streamed one of the attacks on Facebook Live. Tarrant pleaded guilty to the murders in March 2020 and was sentenced to prison with no parole.

Tarrant began to shoot worshippers in the Al Noor Mosque at around 13:40. Between 300 and 500 people could have been in the mosque during Friday prayers when the shooting happened. Someone who lived nearby said the shooter ran from the mosque and dropped a gun. They also said that the man was wearing military-style clothes.

Tarrant live streamed the first 17 minutes of the attack on Facebook live. The stream showed the whole attack on the Al Noor Mosque, and finished as he was driving to the Linwood Islamic Centre. The first victim of the shooting could be heard greeting the shooter on the stream by saying "Hello, brother", who was killed straight after. The shooter was at the mosque for six minutes before driving away. Police were told about the attack at 1:53 p.m.

A second attack happened at around 1:55 p.m. at the Linwood Islamic Centre. It is a mosque away from the Al Noor Mosque. Seven people were killed there.

The mosque's imam said that a person called Abdul Aziz stopped the attack before Tarrant could get into the building. He grabbed a credit card machine and threw it at the attacker. Tarrant then shot at Aziz, who picked up an empty shotgun on the floor and threw it through the window of Tarrant's car. Tarrant then drove away.

The police found two improvised explosive devices in a car. They were defused by the New Zealand Defence Force and did not explode.

In response to the shootings, Jacinda Ardern announced that the New Zealand government will be introducing stronger firearms regulations. She said that the Christchurch mosque attacks has lead to her to see many major weaknesses in New Zealand's gun law. On 10 April 2019, less than one month after the attack, the New Zealand Parliament passed a law that bans most semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles, parts that convert guns into semiautomatic guns, and higher capacity magazines.

On 15 May 2019, Jacinda Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron co-chaired the Christchurch Call summit. The aim of this summit was to "bring together countries and tech companies in an attempt to bring to an end the ability to use social media to organise and promote terrorism and violent extremism". This means she is trying to tell the world's technology companies to take serious measures to actively prevent the internet's social media from promoting terrorism and violent extremism.

Verenahof

Verenahof was until 1967 a tiny part of West Germany containing three houses and twenty-four residents, completely surrounded by land belonging to Switzerland. The West German territory was an enclave separated from the rest of the country by a strip of Swiss land about 200 to 300 metres wide. 

In 1522, Emperor Charles V and his brother Archduke Ferdinand of Austria bought Verenahof at the same time when they bought other small pieces of land in the same region (Tengen, Kommingen, Wiechs am Randen) from Count .

In the 17th and 18th centuries there were arguments between Tengen and Schaffhausen about access roads and the exact border of the enclave.

In 1964 West Germany and Switzerland agreed that Verenahof would become part of Switzerland. This happened on 4 October 1967. Today Verenahof is part of the village of Büttenhardt.

At the Wiechs am Randen town hall there are some remaining border markers that became no longer needed with the land swap in 1967. In Büttenhardt, at the old school house, some old border markers from the 1930s have been used to frame bushes planted around the enclave.

Long and short scales

The long and short scales are two of several large-number naming systems for integer powers of ten that use the same words with different meanings. The long scale is based on powers of one million (1,000,000), whereas the short scale is based on powers of one thousand (1,000). 

For whole numbers less than a thousand million (< 10), the two scales are the same. From a thousand million up (≥ 10), the two scales differ ever more, using the same words for different numbers, which can cause misunderstanding.

Every next short "-illion" word greater than "million" is one thousand times as large as the previous term. Thus, a short:
"billion" (10) means "a thousand million",
"trillion" (10) means a "thousand billion",
"quadrillion" (10) means a "thousand trillion", and so on. Thus, a short "n"-illion equals 10.

Every next long "-illion" word greater than "million" is one million times as large as the previous term. So, the long:
"billion" (10) means a "million million",
"trillion" (10) means a "million billion",
"quadrillion" (10) means a "million trillion" and so on. Thus, a long "n"-illion equals 10.

Every "-illiard" word is one thousand times as large as the previous "-illion" word. So:
"milliard" (10) means a "thousand million",
"billiard" (10) means a "thousand billion",
"trilliard" (10) means a "thousand trillion" and so on. Thus, a long "n"-illiard equals 10.

Countries where the long scale is currently used include most countries in continental Europe and most that are French-speaking, Spanish-speaking (except Spanish-speakers born into an English-speaking culture, e.g. Puerto Rico, because of its influence from English-speaking United States) and Portuguese-speaking countries, except Brazil.

The short scale is now used in most English-speaking and Arabic-speaking countries, in Brazil, in the former Soviet Union and several other countries.

Number names are rendered in the language of the country, but are similar everywhere due to shared etymology. Some languages, particularly in East Asia and South Asia, have large-number naming systems that are different from both the long and short scales, as for example the Indian numbering system.

For most of the 19th and 20th centuries, the United Kingdom largely used the long scale, whereas the United States used the short scale, so that the two systems were often referred to as "British" and "American" in the English language. After several decades of increasing informal British usage of the short scale, in 1974 the government of the UK adopted it, and it is used for all official purposes. Generally, the British usage and American usage are now the same.

The first recorded use of the words "short scale" () and "long scale" () was by the French mathematician Geneviève Guitel in 1975.

To lessen the confusion from the use of both short and long terms in any language, the SI recommends using the Metric prefix, which keeps the same meaning regardless of the country and the language. Long and short scales remain in use for counting money.

Brenton Tarrant

Brenton Harrison Tarrant (born 27 October 1990), a white Australian man, was 28 years old at the time of the shootings. He grew up in Grafton, New South Wales, where he attended Grafton High School. After Tarrant's parents separated when he was young, his mother's subsequent boyfriend abused her and the children. He worked as a personal trainer in his hometown from 2009 to 2011, quitting after an injury; in that time, he inherited A$457,000 from his father, who committed suicide in 2010. In 2015, he took a trip to Ukraine and came into contact with extreme right-wing groups.
At the time of the shootings, Tarrant had been living in Andersons Bay in Dunedin since 2017. He was a member of a South Otago gun club, where he practised shooting at its range. A neighbour described him as a friendly loner. In 2018, Tarrant was treated for eye and thigh injuries at Dunedin Hospital; he told doctors he had sustained the injuries while trying to dislodge an improperly chambered bullet from a gun. The doctors also treated him for steroid abuse, but never reported Tarrant's visit to the authorities, which would have resulted in police reassessing his fitness to hold a gun licence

Gliese 581 c

Gliese 581 c is a exoplanet that orbits the red dwarf star Gliese 581. It is located about 20 light years away in the Libra. It is about six times as massive as Earth, and circles its star about 11 million kilometers from it (the Earth is 150 million kilometers away from the sun). It takes it 13 days to circle the star once. When it was discovered in 2007, it was thought to be Earth-like and habitable. 

Gliese 581 c was thought to be habitable when it was discovered, and it was thought to be in the habitable zone. However, later studies by the von Bloh team said that Gliese 581 c circled too close to the star to be in the habitable zone. Gliese 581 c may also suffer a serve greenhouse effect, making it as hot as Venus. If that is true, it is uninhabitable. Also, red dwarfs like Gliese 581 are not very friendly to life as we know it, since they are very stellar active (meaning they emit strong solar flares and such).

Gliese 581 c may be tidally locked to its star. Just as one side of the Moon always faces Earth, the length of Gliese 581 c's day would then match the length of its year. Tidal locking also means the planet would have no axial tilt and that means the planet would not experience any seasons. Even with a permanent day one one side, and a permanent night on one side, a sliver of land between the two zones may be habitable.

Norwood Junction railway station

Norwood Junction is a rail and Overground interchange in South Norwood, England. It is in Zone 4. The station is managed by London Overground and is served by Overground, Southern and Thameslink trains.

The Norwood Junction railway crash happened on 1 May 1891, when a cast-iron bridge over Portland Road, 60 yards (55 m) north-east of the old station building, split under the weight of an express train from Brighton to London Bridge.

Kepler-186f

Kepler-186f is a exoplanet that goes around the red dwarf star Kepler 186. It is over 580 light years away in the Cygnus constellation. Kepler-186f was discovered in 2014 by the Kepler spacecraft. It is in the habitable zone of its star, so liquid water may exist on its surface. It is known for being the first Earth-sized exoplanets in the habitable zone of a star. 

Kepler-186f is thought to be 97% and 125% the size of Earth (1.11 ± 0.14 the size of Earth) While its mass is not know it is thought to be up to 1.4 times Earth's. The true mass depends on what the planet is made of. If the planet has no atmosphere, then its temprature would be around 182 Kelvin (-91 Celsius). 

Kepler-186f's ESI is thought to be around 0.58.

Kepler-186f is in the habitable zone of Kepler-186, so liquid water may be on its surface. However, just because a planet is in the habitable zone, dos not mean it is habitable. The find is still thought to be important, however, since it has a size similar to Earth's. It only receives one third of the sunlight Earth gets, hence its temperature is thought to be -91 Celsius. However, a greenhouse effect can help heat the surface up, and make it warmer.

A review from 2015 said that Kepler-186f, Kepler-442b, and Kepler-62f, are thought to be the best candidates for habitability.

History 

The Democratic Labour Party (DLP) was founded in 1955 by Errol Barrow and Co-founded by Fredrick Smith. They were once members and candidates of the then ruling-party of Barbados the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) from 1951 to 1955, these people and 29 more people broke away and stepped down as members and candidates of the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) to form his more left-winged and leaning Social democratic alternative, the Democratic Labor Party (DLP) to challenge the then-ruling Barbados Labour Party in the 1956 Barbadian general election. The Democratic Labour Party (DLP) was a split form the Democratic domain of the Barbados Labour Party In 1955. However, as a result of this common orgin, the two parties have been and is still remaining until today, ideologically similar and has similar believes about governing the affairs of Barbados. But the only difference between the two Political parties of Barbados the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) and Barbados Labour Party (BLP), is that the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) focuses more on Democracy and on Human rights, while the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) focuses more on Republicanism and Labour. The first leadership election was held in the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) headquarters of St. George Street In 1955, one day after the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) was founded by Errol Barrow. Errol Barrow contested in that leadership election against Co-founder of the Democractic Labour Party (DLP), Fredrick Smith. It was a heated and close leadership election, and Errol Barrow defeated Fredrick Smith by a large margin of votes and Errol Barrow secured and won 49% of the vote, while Fredrick Smith secured and won 32% of the vote.

Transbrasil Flight 303

Transbrasil Flight 303 was a flight from Congonhas-São Paulo Airport in São Paulo, Brazil, to Hercílio Luz International Airport in Florianópolis, Brazil, on April 12, 1980. It crashed on approach to Hercílio Luz International Airport. Only three of the 58 people on board survived.

The aircraft involved was a Boeing 727-27C, registration PT-TYS. It had first flown on August 14, 1966. It was delivered to Braniff Airways, which leased it to Transbrasil in 1975, and sold it to Transbrasil in 1976.

The aircraft was on a night instrument approach to Hercílio Luz International Airport in a severe thunderstorm when it went off course, struck the hill Morro da Virgínia, and exploded. Probable causes were misjudgment of speed and distance, inadequate flight supervision, failure to initiate a go-around, and improper operation of the engines.

Radu Lupu

Radu Lupu (30 November 1945 – 17 April 2022) was a Romanian pianist. He was known by many to be one of the best pianists at the time of his death. Born in Galați, Romania, Lupu began learning piano when he was six years old. Two of his major piano teachers were Florica Musicescu and Heinrich Neuhaus. From 1966 to 1969, he won First Prizes of three of the world's most famous piano competitions: the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition (1966), the George Enescu International Piano Competition (1967), and the Leeds International Pianoforte Competition (1969). These victories started Lupu's career. 

Lupu was born in Galați, Romania on 30 November 1945, the son of Meyer Lupu, an attorney, and Ana Gabor, a linguist. From his earliest days, Lupu "had always expressed himself by singing", and was given his first piano at the age of 5. He began piano studies in 1951, as a six-year-old, with Lia Busuioceanu. He made his public debut in 1957, at age 12, in a concert featuring his own compositions. He told "The Christian Science Monitor" in 1970 that "from the very beginning I regarded myself as a composer. I was sure, and everybody else was sure, that one day I would become a famous composer". He gave up composing about four years later, saying that he thought he would be "much better as a pianist".

After completing high school in Galați, and graduating from the Popular School for the Arts in Brașov, where he studied harmony and counterpoint with Victor Bickerich, he continued his piano studies at the Bucharest Conservatory (1959–1961) with Florica Musicescu, and Cella Delavrancea, studying also composition with Dragos Alexandrescu. At the age of 16, in 1961, he was awarded a scholarship to the Moscow P.I. Tchaikovsky State Conservatory, where he studied for seven years. In Moscow, he first studied with Galina Eguiazarova for two years, and then with Heinrich Neuhaus and later with his son, Stanislav Neuhaus. He graduated in 1969. However, in a 1981 interview, when asked about what types of influences his teachers had on him, Lupu answered that he thought of himself as more audodidactic: "My first teacher took me to every orchestral concert, and I am also grateful for what I learned in Moscow, but I think of myself, basically (in music anyway), as somebody who is more autodidactic. I took some from Furtwängler, Toscanini, everywhere...more and more so since I left Moscow."

In 1965, Lupu was placed fifth at the International Beethoven Piano Competition in Vienna. The following year he won the First Prize in the Second Van Cliburn International Piano Competition; he also won special prizes for the Best Performance of a Commissioned Work (of Willard Straight's "Structure for Piano") and the Best Performance of a movement from the Aaron Copland Piano Sonata. In the finals, his performance of the first movement of Sergei Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 2, a required piece, was described by Paul Hume of The Washington Post as "the most fiery and thunderous of any of the six finalists". In addition to the Prokofiev, he performed Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5. Alicia de Larrocha, who was on the jury, said that Lupu was a genius. "I did not expect it at all. I am just speechless," Lupu said after his victory. Shortly after the competition, in April 1967, Lupu made his debut at Carnegie Hall in New York City where he played pieces by Beethoven, Schubert, and Chopin. However, Lupu didn't do many of the other performances that came with the prize, instead choosing to return to Moscow to continue learning.

A year after his Cliburn Competition victory, in 1967, Lupu won the first prize in the George Enescu International Piano Competition. Two years later, in October 1969, he won the Leeds International Piano Competition; he performed Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3 in the Finals. The following month, in November 1969, Lupu played his first solo concert in London; Joan Chissell of "The Times" wrote about his performance of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 7 at the recital: "He brought what seemed like a lifetime's experience to its alternating desolation and pride. Never could music come nearer to speech."

In March and April 1970, Lupu made his first recording for Decca Records of Brahms' Rhapsody in B minor and Three Intermezzi, as well as Schubert's Piano Sonata in A minor. He continued to record for the label for the following 23 years. In August 1970, the 24-year-old pianist made his debut at The Proms, performing Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 1 with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Edo de Waart at the Royal Albert Hall. In November 1970, he made his first concerto recording for Decca, of the Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 3 with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Lawrence Foster; he also recorded Beethoven's 32 Variations in C minor.

Lupu's first major concerts in the United States after his Leeds Competition victory were in February 1972 with the Cleveland Orchestra, in the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 with Daniel Barenboim conducting at Carnegie Hall in New York City, and in October 1972 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, in the Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 3 with Carlo Maria Giulini conducting. The performance of the Brahms with the Cleveland Orchestra and Barenboim was reviewed by Harold C. Schonberg, a Pulitzer Prize-winning music critic for "The New York Times" . Schonberg was critical of the performance by Lupu and Barenboim describing it as "willful, episodic and mannered, self-indulgent, capricious". However, he added that "yet through all the eccentricities came the feeling of two young musicians trying hard to get out of the rut and once in a while actually succeeding", but that "in future years this kind of approach may jell for them. Right now it does not come off."

Although Schonberg had been critical of Lupu's debut with the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Barenboim in February 1972, he was far more enthusiastic of Lupu's performance in November 1972 of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Lawrence Foster at Carnegie Hall, writing, in "The New York Times", that "his performance did much to redeem the impression he had made last season in the Brahms D minor Concerto. Then he sounded mannered, finicky, artificial. This time he was a different pianist." Schonberg added:The following year, Lupu recorded the piano concertos of Schumann and Grieg with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by André Previn, a recording described by "Gramophone" as "grandly commanding". In February 1974, Lupu performed a recital at Hunter College in New York, which was raved by John Rockwell of "The New York Times". Rockwell declared Lupu "no ordinary pianist" and wrote about Lupu's performance of Schubert's Piano Sonata in B-flat major:In November 1974, Lupu made his debut with the New York Philharmonic, performing Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21 conducted by James Conlon. In 1975, Lupu debuted with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and gave the premiere of the André Tchaikowsky Piano Concerto, Op. 4 with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Uri Segal at the Royal Festival Hall. In 1976, Lupu recorded Brahms' 6 Klavierstücke and 4 Klavierstücke, which was described by "Stereo Review" as "a glowing realization of what Brahms set down that leaves one at a loss for words and simply glad to have ears." In 1978, he gave his debut with the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Herbert von Karajan at that year's Salzburg Festival. Reviewing a recital Lupu gave at Avery Fisher Hall in 1980, Andrew Porter of The New Yorker hailed Lupu as "a master of the most satisfying kind". 

In June 1982, Lupu made a critically acclaimed recording of Schubert's Impromptus. John Rockwell wrote in "The New York Times" that Lupu's "singing tone here must be heard to be believed. Without belittling the other facets of Schubert's musical personality, he captures the composer's songful essence with a rare beauty - and, in so doing, he reaffirms once more the ability of present-day performers to do ample justice to the music of the past." In addition, "Gramophone" said about the recording:In 1989, Lupu was awarded the "Abbiati" prize by the Italian Critics' Association. In 1995, he won an Edison Award for his album of Schumann's "Kinderszenen", "Kreisleriana" and "Humoreske" which was also nominated for a Grammy Award. In the Grammy Awards of 1996, he won a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra) for Schubert's Piano Sonatas in B-flat major and A major.

In 2006, Lupu was awarded the Premio Internazionale Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli and in 2016 was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to music.

Lupu uses a regular, straight-backed chair at the piano as opposed to a standard piano bench. He told "Clavier" in 1981 that while sitting on a bench he tended to lean forward, raise his shoulders, become impossibly stiff and develop pains all over. He also said that he practiced with a chair at home and found it natural for him. Although Lupu is an admirer of Arthur Rubinstein and Vladimir Horowitz, he named Mieczysław Horszowski as having the most influence on his playing, saying that Horszowski "speaks to me like no one else". Lupu's initial approach to new music is to read it away from the piano, saying that he "reads more easily away from the instrument" and that "it is the only way to learn". Lupu says in regards to tone production that "everything in music comes from the head', adding: "If you have any concept of sound, you hear it in your inner ear. All you have to work for is to match that sound on the instrument. The whole balance, the line, the tone, is perceived and controlled by the head." He further describes tone production as a "matching process for which [one] practices", and the physical contact of the keyboard as "a very individual thing determined by the color or timbre you hear and try to get, the piece you are playing, the phrase".

Lupu's playing has got admiration not only from music critics, but also by fellow major artists. Mitsuko Uchida told Humphrey Burton in a 2002 BBC Radio 3 interview that "there is nobody on earth who can actually get certain range of colour, and also the control - don't underestimate this unbelievable control of his playing." Nikolai Lugansky said in an interview that Lupu "possesses the rare power of letting the music speak for itself", and András Schiff stated that Lupu has the "rare gift to illuminate anything that he plays with rare musical intelligence". Other pianists who have expressed admiration for Lupu or cite him as an inspiration in their music-making include Emanuel Ax, Daniel Barenboim, Seong-Jin Cho (who named Lupu's recording of the Schubert Impromptus as his favorite), Kirill Gerstein, Stephen Hough, Robert Levin, Maria João Pires, and Daniil Trifonov. In addition, the conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin cites Lupu as an inspiration while he was a piano student, saying that listening to recitals and recordings by Lupu "shaped my conception of sound from a very young age", and the cellist Steven Isserlis called him "one of the greatest artists I have ever heard or known".

In the span of 23 years, Lupu made over 20 recordings for Decca Records. His first recording was made in the spring of 1970. Lupu's solo recordings, which have received considerable acclaim, include works by Beethoven, Brahms, Grieg, Mozart, Schubert, and Schumann. His solo recordings without orchestra include 5 Beethoven piano sonatas , as well as Beethoven's two rondos for piano and 32 Variations in C minor; Brahms' Piano Sonata No. 3 in F minor, Two Rhapsodies, Intermezzi, 6 Pieces for Piano and 4 Pieces for Piano; nine piano sonatas of Schubert as well as the Impromptus and Moments musicaux; and Schumann's Humoreske, Kinderszenen and Kreisleriana. His concerto recordings include the complete cycle of Beethoven piano concertos with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Zubin Mehta; the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 with the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Edo de Waart; the Grieg and Schumann piano concertos with the London Symphony Orchestra and André Previn; and two Mozart piano concertos with the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Uri Segal. His chamber music recordings for Decca include all of Mozart's sonatas for violin and piano with Szymon Goldberg; the violin sonatas of Debussy and Franck with Kyung Wha Chung; the quintets for piano and winds of Beethoven and Mozart with Han de Vries, George Pieterson, Vicente Zarzo, and Brian Pollard; and various works by Schubert for violin and piano with Goldberg. He recorded works of Mozart and Schubert for piano four-hands and two pianos with Murray Perahia for the CBS Masterworks, two albums of Schubert songs with Barbara Hendricks for EMI, and a disc of works by Schubert for piano four-hands with Daniel Barenboim for Teldec.

Lupu's first wife was the cellist Elizabeth Wilson (born 1947), daughter of diplomat Sir (Archibald) Duncan Wilson, whom he married in 1971. He later moved to Lausanne, Switzerland with his second wife Delia, a violinist in the Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne.

For most of his career, Lupu refused to grant interviews to the press out of "fear of being misunderstood or misquoted". His aversion to the press and publicity has prompted them to label him as "the reclusive Radu Lupu", with "The Independent" referring to him as a "woolly recluse" and "like someone dragged unwillingly into the concert hall but asked to leave his begging-bowl outside." Lupu usually did not allow radio broadcasts of his performances. In 1994, "Chicago Tribune" noted that Lupu's press kit then contained one single interview he granted to the "Clavier" magazine in 1981. Other published interviews include a "conversation" that Lupu granted to "Clavier" in 1992 and an interview from 1975 that was aired on BBC Radio 3.

Lupu died in Lausanne, Switzerland after a long illness, on 17 April 2022, aged 76.
