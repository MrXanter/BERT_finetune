Cottonwood River

Cottonwood River is one of the main tributaries of the Neosho River in central Kansas of the United States.

The river starts near the west line of Marion County as two tributaries: the North Cottonwood River and the South Cottonwood River. They both start within 2 miles of each other, and they start within a few miles northwest of Lehigh.

The North Cottonwood starts near the west line of Marion County. It crosses into McPherson County and is parallel to the county line northward for 5 miles. Then, crosses back into Marion County. It goes through Durham, then into the Marion Reservoir.

The South Cottonwood also starts near the west line of Marion County. It goes southward about 1 mile west of Lehigh. Then it flows eastward about 2 miles south of Hillsboro, then northeast towards the lower side of the Marion Reservoir.

The North and South Cottonwood join about 1 mile southeast of the Marion Reservoir to become the North Fork Cottonwood River. Then, it goes through the city of Marion. The river goes southeast to Florence, then eastward towards Chase County. In Chase County, it goes northeast through Cedar Point then near Clements and Elmdale. It then flows eastward through Strong City, Cottonwood Falls.

The South Fork Cottonwood River starts south of Matfield Green, then flows northward along the east side of Matfield Green and Bazaar. It combines with the North Fork Cottonwood River about 3 miles east of Cottonwood Falls. Then, it goes eastward near Saffordville and across into Lyon County near Plymouth, Kansas, then along the south edge of Emporia. It goes into the Neosho River about 5 miles east of Emporia.

In 1806, Zebulon Pike led the Pike Expedition westward from St Louis, Missouri. Part of their journey followed the Cottonwood River through Marion County near the current towns of Florence, Marion, Durham.



These lakes are in the Cottonwood River drainage basin:

These bridges over the Cottonwood River are on the National Register of Historic Places list:

Nonlinear system

In mathematics and science, a nonlinear system is a system, where the change of the output is not proportional to the change of the input. In nature, most systems are non-linear. 

Nonlinear problems are interesting to engineers, biologists, physicists, mathematicians, and many other scientists. In nature, most systems are nonlinear. Nonlinear dynamical systems, describe changes in variables over time. Such systems may appear chaotic, unpredictable, or counterintuitive. Linear systems are much simpler.

A nonlinear system of equations is used to mathematically describe a nonlinear system. This is set of equations in which the unknowns (or the unknown functions in the case of differential equations) appear as variables of a polynomial of degree higher than one or in the argument of a function which is not a polynomial of degree one. In other words, in a nonlinear system of equations, the equation(s) to be solved cannot be written as a linear combination of the unknown variables or functions that appear in them. Systems can be defined as nonlinear, regardless of whether known linear functions appear in the equations. In particular, a differential equation is "linear" if it is linear in terms of the unknown function and its derivatives, even if nonlinear in terms of the other variables appearing in it.

Nonlinear dynamical equations are difficult to solve. For this reason, they are commonly approximated using linear equations. If only limited accuracy or a range of the input values is required, this works well. The problem is that it hides interesting phenomena such as solitons, chaos, and singularities. 

Although such chaotic behavior may appear random, it is in fact not random. For example, some aspects of the weather are seen to be chaotic, where simple changes in one part of the system produce complex effects throughout. This nonlinearity is one of the reasons why accurate long-term forecasts are impossible with current technology.

Some authors use the term nonlinear science for the study of nonlinear systems. This term is disputed by others:

Marion Zimmer Bradley

Marion Zimmer Bradley was an American author of science fiction, fantasy and science fantasy. She was born in Albany, New York on June 3, 1930. Her parents were Leslie Raymond Zimmer, a carpenter and Evelyn Zimmer, a historian. They were not a financially secure family. They had financial problems because they lived during the Great Depression of the 1930s.

As a child, Bradley liked reading. She wrote science fiction and fantasy stories which were published in her school. Her goal was still to become an opera singer. Over time her works and participation in speculative fiction brought her recognition as a writer.

Bradley is most famous for her novel "The Mists of Avalon" and her "Darkover" novels.


Q (Star Trek)

Q is the name of a fictional character from "Star Trek". It is also the name of his race. Q appears in "", "", "", and "" and in related media. John de Lancie plays the Q character. He is an extra-dimensional being. The human characters do not know how he came to exist. He has power over time, space, the laws of physics, and reality itself. He is capable of changing reality and even the past when he wants to. Q only sometimes uses contractions in his speech.

Star Trek uses the name "Q" for the names of all the individuals from the Q species. All male and female Q characters refer to each other as "Q." They also call their whole race "Q" and call their home "the Q Continuum" – an alternate dimension accessible to only the Q and people they choose to bring there. The true nature of the realm is said to be beyond the comprehension of "lesser beings" such as humans. When humans go there, they see it in ways they can understand; e.g., a run-down gas station in the "middle of nowhere."

Beginning with the pilot episode "Encounter at Farpoint" of "", Q became a recurring character. Most of his scenes are both dramatic and funny. He enjoys annoying Jean-Luc Picard, the serious human captain of the Enterprise D. He serves as a major antihero throughout "The Next Generation". He is an important part of both the first and last episodes of the show. Q is first presented as a cosmic force judging humanity to see if it is becoming a threat to the universe. However, as the series continues, his role morphs more into one of a teacher to Picard and the human race generally, although he often does this in ways that seem destructive or disruptive or meant for his own fun. Other times, notably during "Deja Q" and "Voyager", Q appears to the crew seeking assistance. For example, one time all the other Q turned Q human as a punishment.

Gene Roddenberry chose the letter "Q" in honor of his friend Janet Quarton.

Fruit preserves

Fruit preserves is the name of specially prepared fruit, where sugar, and sometimes acid, is used to make the fruit last longer. They are often used as a spread.

Sugar is used to preserve sweet fruits, but vinegar is used for savoury items. Fruit preserves have been used for a long time, since before refrigeration, to make food last longer.

Common examples of fruit preserves are jams, jellies, and marmalade.

There are many ways to make fruit preserves. Normally, chopped fruit is boiled with sugar and water. After the mixture gets hot enough, it will become firm after it cools down.

The preserves are poured into glass jars when they are still hot. After they cool down, a vacuum forms in the jar. This keeps the food fresh for a long time.

Southern Illinois

Southern Illinois, also called Little Egypt, refers to the southern third of Illinois. There is controversy over where the southern region of the state officially begins. Lots of people say Southern Illinois starts from Springfield and southward. A number of others Carbondale north to Springfield don't lay claim to that region of Illinois as being that of Southern Illinois, though. Illinois is in the Midwestern United States. But Southern Illinois has been called far more typical for the Upland South, similar to nearby Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee, rather than the Midwest. Locals (Illinois' people) from certain small towns have been part of a movement to completely expel/remove Chicago from the state so a commonwealth can be set up with similar politics to Missouri, Kentucky and Indiana. These small Illinois towns include Athens, Mount Vernon, Urbana and Effingham. The movement is called New Illinois. Under the movement, Southern and Downstate Illinois would be entirely separated from Chicago. The large city would become the 51st state in the United States.

There are lots of cities or towns with a large number of people in Southern Illinois. These include, dependent on references and views of the population of the area and those outside: Springfield, Alton, O'Fallon, Collinsville, Carbondale, Cairo and Mount Vernon. The region also involves St. Louis and Cape Girardeau (both in Missouri), Memphis and Nashville (both in Tennessee), and Evansville, Indiana.

Southern Illinois was covered by the Shawnee National Forest. The area also contains hilly landscape.

The Southern Illinois area has almost 1.2 million people. Most of them live near/in rural settings that are in farm areas. Others, however, live in/near Carbondale–Marion, the Illinois region of the St. Louis metro area, in the Urbana–Champaign region and in/near the Springfield area.

The area of Southern Illinois with the most of all people is the Illinois side of Greater St. Louis. Noted areas are Cahokia Mounds, the American Bottom and East St. Louis. The last mentioned area has had a very rough history involving industrialization, labor, immigration and the struggle for equal rights.

Southern Illinois happens being on the border between humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification "Dfa") and humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification "Cfa"). The area doesn't have any large mountains or large bodies of water to moderate its temperature. That means Southern Illinois areas are prone to both cold Arctic air and hot, humid tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico. Along with the rest of the Midwestern United States, such areas are home to some of the largest temperature extremes in the world. The Southern Illinois area has four distinct seasons. Spring is the wettest season. It has uneven severe weather. This involves severe thunderstorms, tornadoes or winter storms. Summers are hot and humid. This season only has occasional and brief rest. Humidity often makes the heat index rise to temperatures feeling well above . Fall is mild with lower humidity. It can, however, make irregular bouts of heavy rainfall with the first snow flurries. This usually happens during late November. Winters are cold with periodic snow. During this season, temperatures often below freezing. Thaws are usually frequent. Winter storm systems, in particular the Alberta clippers and Panhandle hooks, often bring days of heavy freezing rain, ice pellets and snowfall.

The normal high temperature in July is 90 °F (32 °C). The normal low temperature in January is 21 °F (−6 °C). This, though, varies between one year and another. Both and temperatures can be seen on an average 2 or 3 days per year. The official record low is on February 2, 1884 in Harrisburg. The region's record high is on July 14, 1954 in East St. Louis.

Southern Illinois has thunderstorms about 50 days a year on average. Thunderstorms add to just over half of the area's overall precipitation. Mainly in the spring, these storms will often be severe, with high winds, large hail and tornadoes. Southern Illinois has been affected on more than one occasion by Southern Illinois tornado history|very damaging tornadoes.

A period of warm weather late in autumn known as the Indian summer will sometimes occur. Roses may still bloom as late as November or early December during some years.

Southern Illinois was historically a conservative and Democratic region. Though the political parties have changed, Southern Illinois has almost always voted for Democratic candidates more times than not since 1818. Democratic roots in Southern Illinois relate to the area's shared cultures with the South. The latter United States area was where the Democratic Party, before the American Civil War and after Reconstruction, was the ruling party before the 1960s. Democratic affiliations were tightened in the Great Depression and Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration. There are, however, some long-time Republican counties in the region. The most well-known is Edwards County.

But in the last few decades, Southern Illinois has trended GOP due to the national support for them across rural areas. Northern Illinois has trended towards Democrats due to lots of that area's people leaving from in and near the Democratic-leaning Cook County and nearby counties. Democratic candidates were fierce in the counties across Southern Illinois until around 1996. Beginning from the presidential election of 2000 on, Democratic officials weren't doing well like expected across Southern Illinois even if they had won almost very constantly.

In the early months of the Civil War, several local people in Williamson County voted for secession from the Union. On April 15, 1861, the citizens of Marion made a promise calling for the division of Illinois and the secession of Southern Illinois. The promise was soon rescinded meaning canceled). The General Benjamin Prentiss, however, left a company of men near Marion for defense as he passed by on his way to a garrison in Cairo. Despite some southern sympathizers, most young men in the region joined the Union Army.

Fred Hale

Frederick "Fred" Harold Hale (December 1, 1890 – November 19, 2004) was an American supercentenarian, beekeeper and railway post officer, and at the time of his death the oldest living man.

Both of his parents lived to age 91 and his youngest son, Fred Hale Sr, to age 97. He married Flora Mooers, who died in 1979, in 1910, and had two daughters, Muriel (1910–1970) and Carrie (1913–1992) and three sons, Robert (1916–1918) who died in the Spanish flu, Norman (born 1920) and Fred (born 1921). At the time of his death, Hale also had nine grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren and eleven great-great-grandchildren.

At age 95, Hale surfed for the first time in his life in Hawaii during a stop there on the journey back from Japan where he visited his grandson.

At age 100, he traveled to Europe along with his son Norman and his daughter-in-law, to visit Norman's location of military service during World War II.

At age 108, Hale was recognized by Guinness World Records as the oldest person ever with a driving license, and he believed "bee pollen and honey every day, along with the occasional nip of whiskey" as the secret to a long life.

He became the oldest living American man and the third oldest living man in the world (behind Japaneseman Yukichi Chuganji and Joan Riudavets) on February 24, 2003 when 113-year-old John McMorran died of heart failure and over a year later, on March 5, 2004, after 114-year-old Spaniard Joan Riudavets' death, also the oldest man in the world as well as the last living man born before the tenth and last decade of the 19th century (1891–1900).

Hale died of pneumonia on November 19, 2004, just twelve days before his 114th birthday and before his son Norman (who died at age 84 on December 30, 2004).

Phrynomedusa fimbriata

The spiny-knee leaf frog ("Phrynomedusa fimbriata") is an extinct frog that lived in Brazil. Scientists have only seen it in one place: Paranapiacaba. It was last seen in the early 20th century. People saw it about 1000 meters above sea level.

Scientists believe that these frogs are dead because they have not seen any since the 1950s. They think the frog probably lived in trees and laid its eggs in streams, but they are not sure. Scientists think this frog died because of a few things: air pollution from factories in Cubatão and a fungus called "Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis". This is because the fungus can kill the frog "Phrynomedusa dryade".

Decametre

Kitab al-Futuh

Kitab al-Futūh () is an important hadith and akhbari collection, compiled by Sayf ibn Umar. It is al-Tabari's main source for the Ridda wars and the early Muslim conquests. It also contains important information on the structure of early Muslim armies and government.

Currently, a facsimile edition of the fragments preserved in the Al-Imam University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The Arabic word "Kitab" (), literally means 'book' or 'revelation'. It is derived from the Semitic root K-T-B () which is related to writing. The Arabic definite article "al-" usually means 'of' or 'the'. Futuh () is the plural noun of the Arabic word "Fatah (") which means 'conquest'.

Sayf ibn Umar, the compiler of the book, was from Kufa and lived in Baghdad. He traveled throughout Iraq during the rule of the Abbasid Caliphate.

The book primarily discuss the early Muslim conquests and wars. It also features information about the assassination of the third caliph Uthman. Abdullah ibn Saba and his followers are mentioned in the book as well. The work also contains a brief account, on the authority of Ibn Abbas, of the way in which Paul corrupted Christian doctrines by persuading three of his followers, Yaqūb, Nasṭūr and Malkūn, of the divinity of Īsā (Jesus).

Sayf ibn Umar is considered reliable. W. F. Tucker and Ella Landau-Tasseron note that although Sayf may have been an unscrupulous hadith collector, this should not detract from his general reliability as a transmitter of historical information (akhbārī). Tucker adds that accusations of bias could equally be leveled at other akhbārīs contemporary to Sayf, including the Shi'a historian Abu Mikhnaf. Fuat Sezgin, Albrecht Noth, and Martin Hinds have also challenged Wellhausen's views and placed Sayf on an equal footing with other traditionalists. Linda D. Lau and A. R. Armush also regard Sayf ibn Umar as reliable and accept his accounts and the role of the Saba'iyya at the Battle of the Camel.

Nephilim

The Nephilim, also known as Nephilites (; ) are mysterious beings mentioned in the Hebrew Bible―who are said to be large and strong. The word "Nephilim" is narrowly translated as "giants" in some Bibles but left untranslated in others. They are mentioned in the following books: Genesis, Numbers, and Ezekiel in the Hebrew Bible. The Nephilites and their identity are still unknown to this day.

Numbers 13:33 says that they later lived in Canaan when Israel conquered Canaan. A similar Hebrew term, read as "Nephilim" by some scholars, or as the word "fallen" by others, appears in the Biblical book Ezekiel 32:27

Some people think the Nephilim are giants that were created when fallen angels mated with humans, while others think they were famous ancient warriors and heroes that were created when the descendants of Seth wed the descendants of Cain. 

Brown-Driver-Briggs thought that the Nephilim were giants. Robert Baker Girdlestone thought that they are "the ones that caused the downfall." Donald Hendel thinks that it means "ones who have fallen."

The majority of ancient biblical translations think they were "giants." Symmachus thought they were "the violent ones," and Aquila thought they were either "the fallen ones" or "the ones falling [on their enemies]."

Some Jews believe that the Nephilim had children called Elioud. Aramaics think that Nephilim refers to the children of Orion. J. C. Greenfield thinks that the Nephilim is based on bad things in Sumerian beliefs. Early Arabs thought that fallen angels were sent to Earth looking like men, and they mated with humans.

In Genesis 6:4:The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.

In Numbers 13:32–33:And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

In Ezekiel 32:27: They lie with the warriors, the Nephilim of old, who descended to Sheol with their weapons of war. They placed their swords beneath their heads and their shields upon their bones, for the terror of the warriors was upon the land of the living.

Cotton Mather thought that fossilized leg bones and teeth discovered near Albany, New York, in 1705, were the remains of Nephilim who died in a great flood, though paleontologists thought they were mastodon remains instead.


Spotless crake

The spotless crake, sooty rail, pūweto, puweto, or putoto ("Zapornia tabuensis") is a bird in the family Rallidae. It lives in the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, other parts of Polynesia, and two subspecies have been found high in the hills in New Guinea. Scientists do not know much about them because they hide so well.

The spotless crake is about half the size of a blackbird. It is about 20 cm long. It weighs about 45 g. It has blue-gray and black feathers. It has orange-pink legs. It has a black beak.

Spotless crakes live in wetlands that have fresh water, not salt water. They look for food where the plants grow close together. Sometimes they will walk out on bare mud, but they run back into the plants if they think they are in danger.

The spotless crake eats the seeds of many plants, but it also eats animals without bones, for example beetles and worms. This bird is crepuscular, which means it looks for food at dawn and dusk.

Spotless crakes form one-on-one pairs to lay eggs. They build nests out of pieces of grass woven together. The nest is 30-50 cm above the water. Sometimes they build platforms near the nest. The female lays 2-5 eggs at a time. Both the male and female crake sit on the eggs. The eggs take 20-22 days to hatch. The chicks stay in the nest for about 4 days. They can catch some of their own food at that age. Both parents care for the chicks for 4-5 months.

Human beings change their wetlands into farms. Introduced species brought by humans can also kill the crake.

Funan

Funan (; , ; , Chu Han: ) was an ancient kingdom in Southeast Asia. This kingdom existed from the 1st to the 7th century CE.

Most texts written about this subject was written by foreign travelers. As a result, information about this ancient kingdom is often disputed.

George Cœdès thinks that the word "Funan" came from the word "Bnaṃ" or "Vnaṃ" in old Khmer. The modern Khmer word "Phnom" (meaning mountain or hill) came from this word. Claude Jacques, however, disputes this theory. He pointed out that there is a wrong translation of the Sanskrit word "Parvatabùpála" as "Bnaṃ." There is no ancient Khmer text found using this word to refer to this kingdom.

There are other explanations on how the word was formed. Claude Jacques believes the Chinese created this name because they likes to add "" ("nan") to refer to regions "to the south" (Yunnan, Hainan, ...).

The exact location of the capital is not known. The Book of Liang said the capital is 500 li (250 kilometers) from the sea, so it might be in Ba Phnom (Cambodian province of Prey Veng), Angkor Borei (in the Cambodian province of Takeo) or Óc Eo (now in Vietnam).

George Cœdès believes the name of the capital is "Vyadhapura" (city of hunters) because Angkorian texts described about it. The Book of Tang also recorded the word "Témú" (old Khmer "Dalmāk)" which also means "hunter". But Michael Vickery disputes this claim because of two reasons. First, the two words have different meaning. The "Vyadhapura" killed the animal, but the "Dalmāk" brought the animal home alive. Second, the word "Dalmāk" appeared for the first time in the ninth or early tenth century, and the word "Témú" appeared in Chinese texts for the first time in the sixth century (Funan: 1st—7th century).

Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins

Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins (known in Asia as ) is a 1991 Taiwanese live-action action comedy fantasy movie loosely based on manga Dragon Ball, directed by Chun-Liang Chen.

Chronologically speaking, this is the second live-action adaptation of Akira Toriyama's "Dragon Ball" manga (although an unlicensed and therefore unofficial adaptation), it came a year after the release of "Dragon Ball: Son Goku Fights, Son Goku Wins" (1990).

The earth has seven dragon balls, and each dragon ball has one to seven stars, and the seven dragon balls are scattered all over the world. When someone collects all the dragon balls, he can summon Shenlong. At this time, he can make a wish, and Shenlong will help you realize it. A certain village is holding a handover ceremony for the new village head, and the process also includes a town treasure "Dragon Ball". At this time, the alien Bull Demon King suddenly descended from the sky, led his men to break into the village, and successfully captured the Dragon Ball. Because the Bull Demon King knows that as long as he gets seven dragon balls, he hopes to control all mankind, and now he has got two dragon balls. So the Bull Demon King sent Sparta and Maria to search for the five Dragon Balls scattered in other places in order to realize his dream of conquering the world. Bull Demon King's subordinates found the four-star dragon ball from Sun Wufan, killed Sun Wuhan and took the dragon ball away. Goku, who just met the girl, finds Gohan dead, feels very sad and wants to take revenge. On the way, they meet Leping and Oolong, and prepare to challenge the Bull Demon King with Guixianren. In the end, it was found that Sun Wuhan was not dead, and it was revealed that the Dragon Balls were all in the belly of the Bull Demon King. Wukong used the golden cudgel to drive the last dragon ball into the belly of the bull devil, thus summoning the dragon. So the daughter of the village chief at the beginning of the movie made a wish to bring everyone back to life, and everyone was happy.

The film was mostly shot in the forests of Nantou County, Taiwan, with some scenes also shot in Thailand.

Novial

Novial is a constructed international auxiliary language (IAL) for universal communication between speakers of different native languages. It was created by Otto Jespersen, a Danish linguist. He who had been involved in the Ido movement, and later in the development of Interlingua.

Its vocabulary is based on the Germanic and Romance languages. Its grammar is influenced by English.

Jespersen introduced Novial in his book "An International Language" in 1928. He updated it in his dictionary Novial Lexike in 1930. He proposed several modifications in the 1930s. However, the language became dormant with Jespersen's death in 1943. In the 1990s, with the revival of interest in constructed languages brought on by the Internet, some people rediscovered Novial.

Novial has a simple and regular grammar. The main word order is SVO. There is no grammatical gender (but the sex or gender of referrents can be marked). Verbs don't change according to person or number, and don't have exceptions.

The definite article is "li" which doesn't change. It is used as in English.

There is no indefinite article, although "un" (one) can be used.

Nouns mainly end in e, a, o, u or um in singular. The plural noun is formed by adding –s to the singular (-es after a consonant).

There is also a form for indefinite number, expressed by removing the ending of the noun in singular ("leone" – lion, "leon es kruel" – a/the lion is cruel, or lions are cruel).

If a noun refers to a living being, then the form ending in -e is neutral in regards to sex, the one ending in -a female, and the one ending in -o male. If the noun is based on an adjective, nouns referring to living beings can be made with the previously mentioned rule, and furthermore nouns referring to concrete objects with -u, and abstractions with -um. The third person pronouns follows the same rule, together with the definite article.

The genitive is formed with the ending -n (-en after a consonant) with the plural being -sen (-esen after a consonant) or with the preposition de.

Other cases are formed with prepositions.

All adjectives end in -i, but this may be dropped if it is easy enough to pronounce and no confusion will be caused. Adjectives precede the noun. Adjectives do not agree with the noun but may be given noun endings if there is no noun present to receive them.

Comparative adjectives are formed by placing various particles ("plu, tam," and "min") in front of the adjective receiving the comparison. Likewise, the superlative particles ("maxim" and "minim") precede the adjective. The adjective does not receive an inflection to its ending.

Verb forms never change with person or number. Most verb tenses, moods and voices are expressed with auxiliary verbs preceding the root form of the main verb. The auxiliaries follow the same word order as the English equivalent. The following phrases give examples of the verb forms:


Novial clearly distinguishes the passive of becoming and the passive of being. In English the forms are often the same, using the auxiliary verb "to be" followed by the past participle. However, the passive of becoming is also often expressed with the verb "to get" which is used in the examples below.

The passive voice of becoming is formed with the auxiliary bli followed by the root verb form. It can then be conjugated into the previously mentioned forms, for example:

The passive voice of being is formed with the auxiliary es followed by the past passive participle (stem + -t). For example:

An adjective is converted to a corresponding adverb by adding -m after the -i ending of the adjective.

Comparative and superlative adverbs are formed in the same manner as comparative and superlative adjectives: by placing a specific particle before the adverb receiving the comparison.

Novialide is a term used for languages derivatives of Novial and any constructed language project based on or inspired by Novial.

Some Novialides are:

Video game industry

The video game industry is the industry that connects with the development, marketing, and monetization of video games. 

Modern personal computers have many innovations: sound cards, graphics cards, 3D graphic accelerators, faster CPUs, and dedicated co-processors like PhysX are a few of the more notable improvements. Sound cards, for example, were originally developed for the addition of digital-quality sound to games, and only later were they improved for the music industry. Graphics cards were developed to provide more screen colors, and later on to support graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and games.

In 2017 in the United States the Entertainment Software Association estimated that there were over 2,300 development companies and over 525 publishing companies. These companies in total have nearly 66,000 direct workers.

Ben Sawyer of Digitalmill names six layers of the industry:


Some of the disciplines are game programmer, game designer, level designer, game producer, game artist, and game tester. Most of these professionals are employed by video game developers or video game publishers. However, many hobbyists also produce computer games and sell them commercially.

Traditionally, the video game industry has had six layers in its value chain. 


The video game industry started in the United States. With the personal computer, Western Europe also became a big center for video game development. Companies in North American, Europe, and Japan. are leading in this industry. Other regions, such as Australia/New Zealand, and other southeast Asian countries, for example China and South Korea, are also important.

According to market research firm Newzoo, these countries are the largest video game markets by annual revenue, .

Gaming conventions are very important in the industry. It helps publishers to demonstrate their games. It also helps game players to give their feedback. Some publishers, developers and technology producers have their own regular conventions, for example BlizzCon, QuakeCon, Nvision and the X shows.

The largest trade show is the E3 in Los Angeles, California, It is held by the Entertainment Software Association. Other similar trade shows are Tokyo Game Show (Japan), Brassil Game Show (Brazil), EB Games Expo (Australia), KRI (Russia), China Joy (China) and the Game Developers Conference.

Two of the major professional conferences are: the Game Developers Conference (GDC).

The attention to the video game industry started off with several magazines covering this topic. 

Social media influencers and video game players who create online videos or stream themselves playing games are also playing an important role in showing consumer point of view.

The video game industry has a number of annual award ceremonies, associated with the conventions, trade shows and conferences, as well as standalone award shows. Many of the dedicated video game journalism websites also have their own set of awards. Most commonly, these ceremonies are capped by the top prize, the "Game of the Year".

Phrynomedusa dryade

The monkey frog ("Phrynomedusa dryade") is a frog that lives in Brazil. Scientists have only seen it in five places, always in ponds or mountain streams.

The adult male frog is 28.4 to 31.7 mm long from nose to rear end, and the adult female frog can be 36.1 mm long. Its nostrils are almost as far apart as its eyes. Its eyes are very big. Each eyeball is almost as big as the distance between the eyes.

This frog has thin front legs and strong back legs. It is green in color with clear white lines. Parts of its toes and legs are bright orange.

The female frog lays eggs in rows near cracks in rocks near the water. The tadpoles swim upright in the water, with their tails facing down.

Scientists think that habitat loss might be a threat to this frog. They also think it may have once lived in many more places, but the chytrid fungus "Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis" may have killed those frogs.

The scientific name of this frog "dryade" is from the Greek word "dryas", meaning "from the trees." This is the same word that gives us the name Dryad.

Andrianafidisoa

Andrianafidisoa, popularly known as Fidy (10 March 1964 – 6 October 2021), was a military general of the Army of Madagascar and a Director of the National Mines and Strategic Industries Office (OMNIS). He allegedly attempted a coup d'état against Malagasy President Marc Ravalomanana on November 18, 2006.

Prior to his alleged coup attempt, in October 2006 General Andrianafidisoa had been barred from running for president in the election scheduled for December 3, 2006, for not paying the required deposit of 25,000,000 ariary. Andrianafidisoa had earlier supported Ravalomanana in his struggle against Didier Ratsiraka over election results in 2002, and led an attack by pro-Ravalomanana forces on Fianarantsoa at that time.

While Ravalomanana was out of the country, Andrianafidisoa had leaflets distributed declaring military rule; he called Ravalomanana's government unconstitutional and went to a base at Ivato Airport, seeking support from soldiers. One soldier was reported killed in a clash there, and Ravalomanana's flight, returning from Europe, was diverted to Mahajanga. Andrianafidisoa's takeover attempt failed, and he went into hiding or on the run; the government ordered his arrest and began searching for him. However, the general stated that "I am alive and I am not in hiding," on a telephone call to news organization Reuters. According to him, "Soldiers and politicians have got the message."

Subsequently Andrianafidisoa denied that the events had been a coup attempt, describing this as a misinterpretation. He did, however, acknowledge that he had called Ravalomanana's government unconstitutional and that he called for him to resign. On November 22, Andrianafidisoa received the backing of eight of the 14 presidential candidates, who said he was defending the constitution and the interests of the nation.

A $50,000 reward was offered for Andrianafidisoa's arrest. The secretary of state for public security said that Andrianafidisoa was taken by surprise and captured on December 12 at a hotel, and that he did not resist. Several guns, along with ammunition, were found with him. Police began interrogating Andrianafidisoa on December 14. Andrianafidisoa pleaded not guilty during his trial, and he and his lawyers argued that he had not attempted a coup, but had instead acted as a "lone soldier" attempting to alert the president to the situation of the armed forces. He was sentenced to four years in prison on February 2, 2007, and stated his intention to appeal the verdict. On February 20, he received an additional three-year prison sentence.

Ravalomanana was forced out of office by a combination of popular protests and military intervention in March 2009. Opposition leader Andry Rajoelina then took over as President of the High Authority of the Transition and promptly pardoned Andrianafidisoa, along with many other political prisoners, on 26 March 2009.

Andrianafidisoa died on 6 October 2021.

The new people to the land were the Pequots. The latter were a branch of the Mohawk people. The Pequots people moved eastward into the Connecticut River Valley.

The summer of 1614 was the first time that the Pequots met white settlers. They started trading furs for the settlers' goods. Those included steel knives, needles and boots. In 1633, the Dutch bought land from them (the Pequots). The earlier then opened a fur trading post. Meanwhile (at the same time), the English bought land for settlement from the local tribes.

On the night of May 26, 1637, the Colonial forces arrived outside the Pequot village near the Mystic River. The palisade surrounding the village had only two exits.

Phrynomedusa marginata

The bicolored leaf frog ("Phrynomedusa marginata") is a frog that lives in Brazil. People have seen it between 600 and 800 meters above sea level.

This frog lives in trees in rainforests on the Atlantic side (east side) of the country. It lives where branches of the trees come together like a roof. The female frog lays eggs in cracks in the rock over water. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the water below.

Scientists say this frog is in big danger of dying out. After the fungal disease chytridiomycosis came to its home in the 1980s or 1990s, many of the frogs died. The population has not become larger again. The frog is also in danger from human beings cutting down the forests to build farms and towns and make places for animals to eat grass. Scientists say that if they find the frog again, they should catch it and take it somewhere else to lay eggs.

Scientists thought there were more of this frog than there really were. They now say those other frogs were another species, "Phrynomedusa dryade".

HHVM

HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) is an open-source virtual machine based on just-in-time (JIT) compilation that serves as an execution engine for the Hack programming language and used to support PHP execution before the release of HHVM version 4. By using the principle of JIT compilation, Hack code is first transformed into intermediate HipHop bytecode (HHBC), which is then dynamically translated into x86-64 machine code, optimized, and natively executed. This contrasts with PHP's usual interpreted execution, in which the Zend Engine transforms PHP source code into opcodes that serve as a form of bytecode, and executes the opcodes directly on the Zend Engine's virtual CPU.

HHVM is developed by Facebook, with the project's source code hosted on GitHub; it is licensed under the terms of the PHP License and Zend License.

Watch Hill, Rhode Island

Watch Hill is a wealthy coastal village and also census-designated place (CDP). The village is part of Westerly, Rhode Island. At the 2020 United States Census, Watch Hill had 212 people living there. The village is set at the most-southwest point in all of Rhode Island. The village became very important in the 19th and 20th centuries as a major summer resort. It had rich families building sprawling (spread-out) Victorian style cottages near the southwest tips of Rhode Island. Watch Hill was called by "the New York Times" as a community "with a strong sense of privacy and of discreetly used wealth."

The area was occupied by Niantic Indians in the 17th century, led by Harman Garrett. Colonists used the hill as an important lookout point during the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War, hence the community's name. Some landmarks in the village include the Watch Hill Lighthouse, the first of which was built in 1745; 1880s The Flying Horse Carousel, the oldest operating suspended-horse carousel in the United States and a National Historic Landmark; the Ocean House hotel; and the 1916 Olympia Tea Room.

One point of interest in Watch Hill is the ruins of Fort Mansfield. The ruins are an old coastal artillery post at the very end of Napatree Point. It was one of a series of such forts. They were constructed to guard the eastern entrance to Long Island Sound as part of the coastal defense network for New York City during the Spanish–American War. It was in operation between 1901 and 1909. Then it was closed down over the course of several years. The land was sold in 1926. All the government structures were torn down in winter 1928–29. The three concrete gun emplacements were left behind. They remain there as of October 2021. They usually offer tunnels and underground rooms to explore. Occasionally at low tide, some remains can be seen of the Battery Connell.

Fort Road connected Watch Hill to Fort Mansfield. The New England Hurricane of 1938, though, wiped it out. The storm also destroyed 39 houses, the Yacht and Beach Clubs and a bathing pavilion. Fifteen people were killed. Others survived by clinging to wreckage when they were swept across the bay to Connecticut. Several breachways were created in Napatree Point after the hurricane passed. To this day, Sandy Point remains an island, not a northern extension of Napatree. The shortened Napatree Point is now a barrier beach without any roads or houses. It is open to the public. Napatree Point offers bird watching and surf casting.

Watch Hill is at the most southwest area of Rhode Island. It lies on a stubby peninsula that extends to Block Island Sound. It includes a smaller peninsula known as Napatree Point. Napatree is a -long sandy spit. It extends west from the Watch Hill business district, and Sandy Point. The latter was once attached to Napatree Point. Both Napatree and Sandy Point shelter Little Narragansett Bay. They have made Watch Hill a popular harbor around which the business district has grown.

Watch Hill is a two-hour drive from Boston. The place is also a three-hour drive from New York City. On clear days, there are views of Montauk, New York to the south and Block Island, Rhode Island to the southeast.

According to "The New York Times", Watch Hill was historically home to "a select group of wealthy families." Their lives happened around "golf and tennis at the Misquamicut Club, bathing and yachting at the Watch Hill Yacht Club, and tea and cocktails at Ocean House and Watch Hill's other grand hotels." Rich families built sprawling Victorian-style "cottages" along the peninsula. The village was known as "a somewhat staid and family-oriented community" compared to glittering Newport. The latter was Rhode Island's other, more famous summer colony. Famous guests to the seaside resort included Albert Einstein, Douglas Fairbanks, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Groucho Marx, David Niven and Jean Harlow.

For several generations, the community has maintained its "old-money summer colony" atmosphere. This was even as traditional summer communities have developed, namely Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and the Hamptons. New England traditions are evident in the popular hobbies of its local people. These include golf, sailing, tennis and the "privacy-loving multigenerational families tucked into century-old shingled houses." Many of these are passed down in families for several generations. "The New York Times" notes that "Watch Hill impresses visitors with a strong sense of privacy and of discreetly used wealth—the rambling, old-fashioned, turreted and ginger-breaded Victorian summer houses with piazzas and softly rolling lawns have little in common with the overpowering castles of the very rich in Newport, a place rarely mentioned in Watch Hill even though it is barely 30 miles distant."

The waterfront was once lined with huge Victorian hotels. However, fire and hurricanes destroyed almost all during the 20th century. The two remaining hotels are the Ocean House and the Watch Hill Inn. Both went through major remodels during the 2000s. The Ocean House was originally opened in 1868. it was torn down in 2005, then completely rebuilt and reopened in 2010. The Ocean House today contains both hotel rooms and condominiums. It is the only Forbes Five-Star and AAA Five Diamond Hotel in Rhode Island It was described by "The New York Times" as a place which "conjures up another age, when women wore white gloves to tea and golf was a newfangled pastime." Celebrities have stayed for holidays at this hotel. Those include Hugh Jackman and Regis Philbin.

The village is listed as a census-designated place. The Watch Hill Historic District is a historic district in the village. It is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is a state-charted Fire District (1901). This means the Watch Hill area is authorized to tax residents to fund their volunteer fire department. The bulk of property taxes, however, go to the town to fund municipal services and schools.

Well-known present and former local people of Watch Hill include:

Kohima Stone Inscription

The Kohima Stone Inscription or Gambhir Singh's Stone is a stone with writing carved into it. It was erected by King Raja Gambhir Singh (Chinglen Nongdrenkhomba) of Manipur kingdom in Kohima (), the capital of Nagaland. It was erected in 1833 AD as a mark of Manipuri conquest and supremacy over the Naga Hills in 1832 AD. It was inscribed in sanskritised Manipuri language (Meitei language) in Bengali script. Manipuri King Raja Gambhir Singh (Chinglen Nongdrenkhomba) conquered the whole Naga Hills with his military power of Manipur Levy. It was after he had finally defeated the Angami Naga tribes of Kohima that the historic testimonial stone inscription was erected.

Manipuri influence over the Naga tribes declined during a period before and after the Burmese war of 1819-25. However, it was re-asserted during the time of Raja Gambhir Singh (Chinglen Nongdrenkhomba). He reduced many tribesmen villages, including Kohima, at which he stood upon the stone and had his footprints sculpted on it as a token of conquest. Kohima and its surrounding villages were the boundaries of Manipur. The Nagas greatly respected this stone and cleaned it from time to time.

The stone is so much important that it is frequently mentioned in many land laws and orders announced by the British Government of Naga Hills. One famous example is the Order of W.J. Williamson, a British Political Agent of Naga Hills on the 19th April, 1880.

The stone inscription is notably mentioned in the "My Experiences in Manipur and the Naga hills" (1896) by Colonel Sir James Johnstone, the then Political Agent of Manipur, and the The Meitheis (1908) written by Thomas Callan Hodson, the then Political Agent of Manipur.

Phasmahyla cochranae

The chocolatefoot leaf frog ("Phasmahyla cochranae") is a frog that lives in Brazil. People have seen it between 800 and 1600 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 28 to 37 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 41 to 46 mm long. The pupils of its eyes go up and down and open side to side. It does not have webbing on its front feet. This frog can change color during the day: it can be green or brick brown. It has orange, purple, or brown spots on its sides.

This frog lives by the plants near the edges of streams in forests. They do not live in large groups. Scientists usually find no more than three frogs singing together. The female frog lays eggs in folded leaves hanging above the stream. The eggs are cream-white. She lays about 32 at a time. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall into the stream. They stay tadpoles for about five months. They look for food at the surface of the water.

Many of the places where this frog lives are protected parks, for example Parque Estadual Nova Baden and Parque Municipal do Itapetinga. However, it still suffers from habitat loss and changes that human beings make to the places it lives. Because of damage to the ozone layer, there is more ultraviolet radiation than is good for this frog. Also, this frog suffers from habitat fragmentation: that means that even though many places the frog lives are protected, the frogs cannot move from one to another easily. Human beings cut down the forests where the frog lives to make farms, tree farms, places for animals to eat grass, and towns and cities.

Adolf Hitler Uunona

Adolf Hitler Uunona is a Namibian civil rights activist and politician. He has been a councilor and member of the South-West Africa People’s Organization since 2004. He received much attention in 2020 when he won a local election and news sources wrote about how he shared a name with Adolf Hitler, the former dictator of Nazi Germany.

Uunona joined politics as an activist and as a member of SWAPO. He was also a member of the militant organization People's Liberation Army. At the time, South Africa had a system which separated black and white people named apartheid.

He has been elected as a councillor several times since 2004 at the constituency of Ompundja in the Oshana regional council elections in year 2010 and 2015. In November 2020, he won a local election in northern Namibia with 1,196 votes, which was 85% of the vote. The other person in the election, Mumbala Abner of the IPC party got only 213 votes. Uunona continued to be the councillor of the Ompundja constituency of Namibia.

German names like “Adolf” are common in Namibia, in part because Namibia was a German colony called German South West Africa between 1884 and 1915 under the German Empire, and later a mandate of the Union of South Africa.

International news sources wrote that Uunona has the same name as Adolf Hitler, the dictator of Germany during World War II. Adolf Uunona says his father probably did name him after Adolf Hitler, but does not think his father knew who Adolf Hitler was at the time. "It wasn't until I was growing up that I realized: This man wanted to subjugate the whole world," he said. Uunona usually goes by the first name "Adolf" alone or "Adolf Uunona" while in public. He says he has no plans to change his name, since it is already on so many government documents. Uunona is known to take his name light-heartedly, saying that he has no goals of "world domination."

There are some memes about how his name is similar to the dictator Adolf Hitler. These memes generally have a picture of an article with a title like "Man named Adolf Hitler wins election in Namibia," and a caption about Uunona not being related to the Austrian German Adolf Hitler.

The South West Africa People’s Organisation (, SWAPO; , SWAVO; , SWAVO), officially known as the SWAPO Party of Namibia is a political party in Namibia.

A major conflict broke out on 26 of August 1966, when a group of the South African Police and SWAPO forces shot at each other. This became the start of what became known in South Africa as the Border War.
The neighbouring country of Angola gained its independence on 11 November 1975 during the Portuguese Colonial war.

The frog is named after Carlos Alberto Gonçalves da Cruz, a Brazilian amphibian scientist. Scientists say people should call it Mangaratiba tree frog in English.

The adult male frog is long from nose to rear end and the only adult female frog the scientists found was long. It has a short nose and big eyes that stick out of its head. Its ear disk is large, but a piece of skin covers part of it. There are disks on its toes for climbing. There is no webbed skin on any of its feet. The frog's skin is green in color with purple spots. The belly is light in color. The iris of its eyes is silver-gray in color.

Older tadpoles can be long, with the tail.

People have found these frogs in streams with sand on the bottom. These places were always 200 meters above sea level or higher. This frog can only live in forests in which the branches come together like a roof.

Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place.

Abd Allah ibn Saba

Abd Allah ibn Saba () was an Arab Jewish religious leader in the 7th-century. His followers were known as Saba'iyya.

Abd Allah ibn Saba is considered the first ghulat (extremist). He was the first one to declare faith in the Imamate of Ali. After Ali’s death, he is said to maintain this idea that "a devil in ʿAli’s appearance had been murdered" and ʿAli had ascended to heaven and that his occultation (rajʿa) was imminent. Saba probably invented the concept of ghayba and return.

Heinz Halm records him as a representative of a Ghulat group from the city of Seleucia-Ctesiphon ("al-Madā'in") who came to see ‘Alī in Kūfah. When Saba proclaimed divinity, then ‘Alī denied this angrily and exiled him back to Seleucia-Ctesiphon.

Tabari and Sayf ibn Umar record Abd Allah ibn Saba from playing any major role in the political events that led to Uthman's killing. He and his followers are said to be the ones who enticed the Egyptians against Uthman on the ground of Ali's special right of succession, and participated in further instigation at later conflicts.

There is a favorable Shia quote that formed around the figure of Abdullah ibn Saba. The story of Saba has also been used by Shia factions to both attack and defend extreme Shia groups. In an non-authentic Shia source, Abd Allah ibn Saba was cursed by Ja'far al-Sadiq.

Jews view Saba negatively and historical Jewish sources regarded him as an apostate from Judaism. Sunni Muslims view Saba as a ghulat seeking to corrupt the message of Islam from by introducing proto-Shia beliefs. Since Saba used to hate Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman, Sunni Muslims view him negatively and curse him. Sa'd ibn Abdullah al-Ash'ari al-Qummi reported in al-Maqaalaat wal-Firaq p. 20:

Bacon's Rebellion

Bacon's Rebellion was an armed uprising in British Colonial Virginia in 1676. It is named after Nathanial Bacon, a man who moved from England to Virginia. He fought against his cousin, William Berkeley, who was governor of Virginia at the time. Bacon wanted to fight against all the Native Americans in Virginia and make them leave. Berkeley only wanted to attack Native Americans who attacked white settlers first.

The white people living in Virginia had problems in the 1670s. They grew tobacco to sell, but the prices had gone down. Also, manufactured goods from England cost more and because of mercantilism, the colonists were not allowed to make their own things. This made them want someone to blame. Many of them blamed American Indians who also lived in Virginia.

First, the Doeg Indians attacked a plantation belonging to Thomas Matthews. Matthews owed them money and had not paid. The colonists attacked the Indians back. But they attacked the wrong group. They attacked Susquehanaug Indians, not Doeg Indians. Then many groups of American Indians began to attack the colonists.

William Berkeley tried to make peace. He invited Indian chiefs to a meeting, but they were murdered. Colonists kept attacking Native Americans no matter what Berkeley said. Then Berkeley started a meeting called the Long Assembly. He took gunpowder away from peaceful Native Americans and promised the colonists he would send the army to attack Native Americans who were not peaceful (according to him). However, he raised taxes to pay the army. The colonists did not like this. At the Long Assembly, Berkeley also made rules for trading with Native Americans so no one could give them guns or other war supplies. But he gave favors to his friends. The colonists did not like this either.

Bacon and his friends kept attacking different groups of American Indians. Berkeley came with "well-armed gentlemen" to find Bacon. Bacon and 200 men ran away into the woods. Berkeley declared Bacon a rebel. Bacon kept attacking American Indians.

Berkeley offered to pardon Bacon if he would stop, turn himself in, and go to England for trial. But the Virginia government, the House of Burgesses, said Bacon had to come and beg forgiveness. Other Virginians liked Bacon's actions so much that they voted for him to be in the House of Burgesses.

When Bacon showed up to the June Assembly, Berkeley caught him. But instead of putting him in prison, he pardoned him. Bacon took his seat in the Assembly.

At the Assembly, Bacon got into a fight about what to do about Native Americans. He walked out and came back with armed men. Bacon told Berkeley to name him General and let him keep fighting American Indians. Berkeley said no and told Bacon to shoot him instead. But eventually, Berkeley changed his mind and told Bacon to keep fighting Indians. After that, Bacon had more control over Jamestown than Berkeley did. Berkeley even left the town for a while.

Bacon and Berkeley fought with armies over who would control Jamestown. They both tried to get white indentured servants and black slaves to join their side. More of these servants and slaves wanted to join Bacon because they knew that they could get more land if there were no American Indians living nearby. At one point, Bacon's fighters set Jamestown on fire. They kept fighting until Bacon died of disease in October 1676.

Berkeley retook Jamestown and hanged 23 people who had helped Bacon. He also took property away Bacon's supporters without a trial. King Charles II told Berkeley he could not be governor of Virginia any more. Berkeley went back to England and died there in 1677.

Some people say Bacon was one of the people who pushed for reform at the Assembly of June 1676, but he wasn't. The Assembly did decide to let freed slaves vote and other good things, but those laws had already been started before Bacon's rebellion.

Before and during the 20th century, historians thought of Bacon's Rebellion as the first time Americans fought against unjust government. They said it was like the American Revolutionary War, but sooner. The Revolution started exactly one hundred years later in 1776.

21st century historians disagreed. They said it was about two selfish leaders instead: Berkeley and Bacon.

Historians note that white and black people fought together on the same side, both poor free whites, poor free blacks, indentured white servants and enslaved blacks.

Konthoujam Lairembi Stone Inscription

The Konthoujam Lairembi Stone Inscription (; ) or Konthoujam Lairemma Stone Inscription (; ) is a stone inscription found in the Konthoujam village of Manipur.

The stone inscription is in the sacred temple complex of Goddess Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi () in the Konthoujam village. It is on the south of the National Highway No. 53 in the west of Imphal city. The stone engaged in this inscription is the sandstone. The inscription consists of 14 lines of writings in Meitei language (Manipuri language) in archaic Meetei script.
Notably, the writings from the fifth to the seventh lines were highly damaged and distorted. So, proper study on these particular lines has been very hard and unsuccessful.

It does not mention any particular date. But paleographic study confirmed that it was written in two different times. The first 7 lines of writings have been assigned to the time of King Khagemba (1592 AD-1652 AD). The remaining 7 lines of writings are assigned to the time of King Charairongba (1697 AD-1709 AD).

The inscription shows that King Khagemba assigned compulsory state duty for the Konthoujam clan to worship goddess Huimu Leima. Notably, the Loyumba Shinyen Constitution also assigned the Konthoujam clan to look after the worship of Goddess Huimu Leima, and not Konthousu (Tampha Lairembi). And according to the Konthoujam Nongarol (), Goddess Huimu Leima is the mother of goddess Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi (Chingphulon Konthousu), the one who got married to Salailen (Soraren), the king of heaven.

The California Wildfires 2021 are a series of wildfires. They burned in wild parts of California in the United States. As of July 26, 2021, a total of 5,566 fires happened , with 458,429 acres (185,520 ha) burned in California. Brushfires destroyed at least 323 buildings, and at least 7 firefighters were hurt fighting the fires.

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said that, in January 2021 alone, 297 fires happened across 1,171 acres (4.74 km2) of non-federal land. This is almost three times the number of fires than the five-year average. It is more than 20 times the area of ​​the five-year average. The January fires were worse because of strong Santa Ana winds. Some of the fires burned in the same areas as previous fires.

The long-term trend is that wildfires in the state are on the increase due to climate change.

Experts said drought, extreme heat, and less snow in the winter made the fires burn worse. The state also faces an increased risk of landslides after wildfires because the plants that hold the earth in place have burned and died.

In 1978 in Italy, Vikramaditya is a world-renowned palmist. Dubbed as the "Einstein of palmistry," he is a disciple of the saint Paramahamsa. Vikramaditya, who does not believe in relationships, instantly falls for doctor Prerana. They meet on a train but separate thereafter. One day, Vikramaditya reads the palm of businessman Anand Rajput. As Vikramaditya does not predict the future in his favour, Rajput's men chase him which results in his accident. He admits into Prerana's hospital and is treated there. After recovering, Vikramaditya proposes Prerana to be in a firtationship with him. Prerana, however, leaves the town but Vikramaditya follows her all the way. She accepts and they begin to date each other. Prerana's uncle, however, asks her not to develop any feelings towards Vikramaditya.
When Vikramaditya and Prerana are traveling on a train, a stranger requests him to read the palm of his daughter, an aspiring archer. He predicts that she does not have any future in sports, and she should instead focus on education. Amazed by Vikramaditya's skill, everyone in the coach ask for predictions by showing their palm but Vikramaditya hesitantly gets down along with Prerana. However, he realizes that everyone on the train is destined to an immediate death. He chases the train to stop it but in vain. Later that evening, the train meets an accident, leading to several casualties. Prerana, who starts to believe in palmistry, asks Vikramaditya to read her palm. He predicts that she would have a long life with a bright future but she faints immediately with a bleeding nose. Prerana is admitted to the hospital where her uncle, who is also a doctor, reveals that she is suffering from an incurable tumor and may die within months. Vikramaditya disagrees since he predicted otherwise but is thrown out of the hospital.
Prerana is now hopeful of her life. Her uncle, on the other hand, believes Vikramaditya is a fraud and only medicine can change her fate. He tests Vikramaditya with dead people's palms, and Vikramaditya deduces all of them correctly. Her uncle changes his mind and trusts Vikramaditya's prediction. As expected, a cure for Prerana's disease was found. Filled with happiness, Prerana proposes Vikramaditya.

Phasmahyla lisbella

Phasmahyla lisbella is a frog that lives in Brazil. Scientists have only seen it in one place: Fazenda Ventania in Área de Protecão Ambiental Ventania. People have seen it between 536 and 1,000 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is about 30.4–34.4 mm long from nose to rear end. The skin of its back is bright green in color with very small dark brown spots. There is a yellow and brown pattern on its sides. This frog can change color. It is bright green during the day and green-brown at night. Scientists think this may may make the frog hard to see while it is resting during the day. This frog can have purple marks on its skin.

The male frogs sit on plants hanging over a stream and sing for the female frogs. Like other frogs in "Phasmahyla", this frog does not lay eggs in the water. Instead, the female frog climbs to a tree branch over the water. She folds a leaf into a pocket shape. She puts her eggs in the pocket. She uses special glue to hold the pocket shut. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles fall down into the water.

Scientists named this frog after Lis Alves Pereira de Oliveira da Rocha and Bella Alves Pereira Custódio da Rocha.

Scientists believe this frog is in danger of dying because it lives in such a small place and because human beings cut down the forest where it lives to make farms and tree farms, make places for cows to eat grass, and to build towns. Scientists also believe people might catch these frogs to sell as pets.

In 2019 it launched a successful crowdfunded challenge to the prorogation of parliament by Boris Johnson's Conservative government. The prorogation was ruled illegal by the Supreme Court.

Induced pluripotent stem cells

Induced pluripotent stem cells are a kind of stem cell. Shinya Yamanaka discovered them in 2007 at Kyoto University. They are often called iPS cells.

iPS cells are a kind of adult stem cell. They are made from cells from the bodies of adults. This is different to embryonic stem cells which are taken from human embryos. Yamanaka's lab was able to take ordinary body cells, and make them become pluripotent. Being pluripotent means that they can become any other kind of cell. In other words, they can become any kind of cell like embryonic stem cells, but do not need to be taken from human embryos.

Yamanaka was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize with Sir John Gurdon "for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent".

HE 1523-0901

HE 1523-0901 is a red giant star in the Milky Way galaxy. It is approximately 7500 light years from Earth. It is thought to be a second generation, Population II, or metal-poor, star ([Fe/H] = −2.95). The star was found in the sample of bright metal-poor halo stars from the Hamburg/ESO Survey by Anna Frebel and collaborators. The group's research was published in the May 10, 2007 issue of "The Astrophysical Journal".

The star's age, as measured by ESO's Very Large Telescope, is 13.2 billion years. This makes it among the oldest stars and nearly as old as the estimated age of the universe itself (13.8 billion years as measured by Planck). The measurement uncertainty in the age estimate is 0.7 to 2.7 billion years, depending upon the assumptions made to estimate the uncertainty, although the uncertainty in the relative age of this and other stars using the same method is smaller. HE 1523-0901 is the first star whose age was determined using the decay of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium in tandem with measurements of several neutron capture elements. It is believed to have formed directly from the remnants of the first-generation stars that reached the end of their longevity and exploded as supernovae early in the history of known matter.

The designation "HE 1523-0901" indicates that the star is part of the Hamburg/ESO Survey catalog. A list of astronomical catalogues can be used to find which catalog a star or other object is from based on its prefix. Most objects are listed in several catalogs and will often be known by several different designations.

HE 1523-0901 is approximately 0.8 solar masses. It can be viewed particularly well from the southern hemisphere with the use of a small telescope. It can also be observed from central European latitudes.

Drivers in Jordan's cars have achieved 19 podium finishes, the first being Rubens Barrichello at the 1994 Pacific Grand Prix and the last being Tiago Monteiro at the 2005 US Grand Prix, although it should be noted that only six drivers competed in this race. Jordan has also won 2 pole positions (Rubens Barrichello in qualifying for the 1994 Belgian Grand Prix and Heinz-Harald Frentzen in qualifying for the 1999 European Grand Prix). The team's best placing in the constructors' standings was 3rd (61 points) in the 1999 season.

In 1980, Eddie Jordan founded Eddie Jordan Racing, first in Formula 3 and then in Formula 3000. In the Formula 3000 category, Jean Alesi won the championship in a Jordan-designed car in 1989. After several successful seasons in lower series, Jordan decided to form a team in Formula 1.

The debut in the 1991 season turned out to be very successful for the team. Although it was not possible to win the podium, the team scored 13 points and finished 5th in the constructors' standings. Andrea de Cesaris, Bertrand Gachot, Michael Schumacher, Roberto Moreno and Alessandro Zanardi rode for the team in their debut season. The next two seasons were not so successful - in 1992 and 1993 the team was 11th in the constructors' standings. Jordan's drivers managed to score just one point in the 1992 season and 3 points the next. The team returned to its good disposal in the 1994 season, in which it was fifth in the constructors' championship. The drivers scored 28 points for the team, and Rubens Barrichello managed to get pole and bottom of the podium. He also finished fourth five times. The team's second driver, Eddie Irvine, did not do that well, scoring only three times throughout the season. Before the next season, Jordan changed engine supplier from Hart to Peugeot .

The team, however, fared slightly worse and fell to the 6th position (21 points). This time PP failed to win, but the 1995 Canadian Grand Prix both drivers finished on the podium - Barrichello in second position, Irvine in third.

The team entered the next season with a new sponsor - the tobacco company Benson and Hedges, which sponsored Jordan until 2005 . Eddie Irvine left for Ferrari and was replaced by Martin Brundle, who moved from Ligier . The 1996 season Jordan once again finished 5th - this time with 22 points. The Irish team did not manage to win a place on the podium. In the 1997 season, the team's colors were changed to yellow and black (such colors remained until the end of Jordan's existence). The line-up has also completely changed - Brundle retired and Barrichello moved to Stewart . The new squad was formed by Giancarlo Fisichella and rookie - Ralf Schumacher . The best period in the history of the Irish team was beginning - although the team took 5th place in the constructors' classification (33 points), this time the drivers stood on the podium 3 times - once the younger of the Schumacher brothers, and twice Fisichella. The following season, the engines were changed to Mugen-Honda, and the Italian who left Benetton was replaced by the 1996 world champion, British Damon Hill, who joined the team from the very weak Arrows . He also won Jordan's first victory - in a rainy Belgian Grand Prix, mostly remembered for a huge crash at the start. Hill's partner, Ralf Schumacher, came second in this race. It was the only double win for the team. In addition, the younger Schumacher finished third at the Italian Grand Prix . Jordan finished the season in 4th place in the constructors' standings. Before the next season, Ralf Schumacher was replaced with Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who has been driving for the Frank Williams team so far. It turned out to be a good choice - the 1999 season turned out to be the best in the history of the team. The German fought Mikka Hakkinen and Eddie Irvin for the world championship for a long time. He stood on the podium 6 times, of which he won 2 times. Damon Hill was doing much worse this time - he scored only 7 points and ended his career after the season. Jordan Grand Prix, with 61 points on his account, took 3rd place in the constructors' standings of the 1999 season.

However, the 2000 season was much worse for Jordan - despite quite good positions in qualifying and two-thirds of Frentzen's places, the team scored just 17 points and only finished 6th in the constructors' standings. The next season's results were even worse, this time the competitors in the yellow cars did not win a single podium place for the first time since 1996. However, the team's total score was slightly higher and amounted to 19 points, which allowed it to take 5th place. In the 2002 season, Fisichella returned to the team. However, it was getting worse - the drivers scored only 9 points throughout the season (although it gave 6th place, just like the previous two seasons). After the season, the engine supplier was changed - instead of Honda, Cosworth was chosen. Jordan began to slide slowly to the bottom. Financial problems ensued. Although the team ended the 2003 season with a slightly greater score - 13 points, it was only enough for the 9th place in the constructors' championship. It's also worth noting that 10 of these 13 points were scored by Fisichella after his rather lucky victory at the Brazilian Grand Prix. The next season was even weaker - Nick Heidfeld and Giorgio Pantano (replaced in the last three races by Timo Glock ) scored just 5 points, which allowed only the weakest team - Minardi - to overtake for years.

On February 3, 2005, it was announced that in the last - as it turned out later season, the team will be racing debutants - Portuguese Tiago Monteiro, who previously served as the test driver of the Miniardi team, and Indian Narain Karthikeyan, who entered Formula 1 from the World Series by Nissan. The results were slightly better (12 points), but the place remained the same - 9. Eddie Jordan has sold the team to the Russian group Midland and from the next season the team has been transformed into MF1 Racing.

He won a Portuguese Cup and Super Cup in addition to achieving good campaigns with the green and white team reaching the semifinals of the UEFA Europa League 2011-12 and won a runner-up in the Primeira Liga in 2013. In 2015 André did not want to renew his contract It expired at the end of the season, which the board did not like. Sporting Lisboa president Bruno de Carvallho ignored the fact that 'the snake' is the star of his team and decided to 'freeze' it in September 2015. This consisted of André not playing a single game with his team until he renewed . André and his representative knew that this was going to lower their price; however, they chose to wait until the summer market where they signed a pre-contract with Benfica.

His debut with the team was in the Cova da Piedade where they would win 5-0 and his first goal converts him against Nacional where they would end up winning 3-1 on the third date of the Portuguese League.

His debut was in the draw against Brighton, entering at 47 'for Cathcart. His first goal was against Swansea City making it 1-0 to finish 1-1. Curiously, days before, his coach had asked him to finish more on goal. With the arrival of coach Javi García at Watford, the player did not have much continuity with the team. His position was filled by Hughes or Feminía. On July 16, 2018, his transfer to the Al Hilal club of the Saudi Professional League was confirmed. His assignment lasted for a season for which 4 million euros were paid with a purchase option of 20 million euros.

With 10 goals in 57 appearances for Peru since his debut at age 19, Carrillo is the team's fourteenth top scorer, behind only Christian Cueva. He participated in the following continental tournaments: Argentina 2011, Chile 2015, Copa América Centenario, Brazil 2019, Brazil 2021 and finally, the World Cup in Russia 2018.

Root mean square

The root mean square is a way of calculating how badly a set of observed numbers differs from a set of expected numbers.

Assume we have a set of observations as numbers, and we also know for each observation what the expected number was. Now let's say that we want to know how much these observations differ from their expected numbers. One approach would be to calculate the individual differences (expected - observed), add them all up, and divide by the number of observations. The problem here is that some of the observations will be larger than the expected values resulting in negative difference values.

To prevent the negative numbers from canceling out the positive we first need to take the absolute value of each of the differences. The average of the absolutes is called the Mean Absolute Error. The MAE treats all numbers as equal when it calculates the average, however, what if we care more about large differences and not so much about smaller ones. 

This is where the root mean square is helpful. The RMS first squares the difference values, it then calculates the average and finally takes the root of the result. The square and root operations cancel each other out. And the square operation also neatly solves our problem of negative numbers. Since we are now squaring numbers larger differences count heavier in the final value.

The adult male frog is 73.9 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 84.2 mm long. The fronts of the faces of male and female frogs have different shapes: females' are rounder. This frog has disks on all its front and back toes for climbing.

The frog's skin is green on its back but it has many colors on its underside: lavender, pink, orange and blue down the sides. It has green, blue, and orange on its front feet. It has yellow stripes on its front and back legs. Its belly is yellow to orange in color.

This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. It lives in forests up in the hills, but scientists have also seen it in city parks and lots.

The female frog lays eggs on plant leaves or branches hanging above the water, 47 to 162 eggs at a time. The eggs are green when she lays them and turn light brown as the tadpole gets ready to hatch. When they do hatch, they fall off the plant into the water. The tadpoles have dark brown heads and blue color on their bodies. In a laboratory, the tadpoles take 247 days to become frogs, but scientists think it is probably faster in the wild.

This frog is in danger of dying out for many reasons. First, human beings build things and graze animals in the forests where they live. Second, climate change is also changing their forests. Third, there is more ultraviolet radiation than there used to be, and this hurts the frog. Fourth, the disease chytridiomycosis. Chytridiomycosis is caused by a fungus that did not come from South America. People brought it there by accident. Fifth, people also brought the fish "Xiphophorus hellerii" to Costa Rica. This fish eats the frog's tadpoles. Sixth, the fly "Megaselia scalaris" eats the frog's eggs.

Liturgical language in Hinduism

Hinduism is traditionally considered to have Old Tamil and Sanskrit as its principal liturgical languages. Hinduism finds its earliest literary mention in the ancient Tamil Sangam literature dated to the 5th - 10th century BCE. Tamil has huge volume of literature in Hinduism especially Saivism and Vainavism. Origin of Hinduism is based on Dravidian folk religion, an ancient non-vedic form of Hinduism.Shaivism developed based on pre-Vedic religions and traditions derived from the southern Tamil Dravidian Shaiva Siddhanta traditions and philosophies.

Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas, Bhagavadgita, Puranas like Bhagavatam, the Upanishads, the Hindu epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata and various other liturgical texts such as the Sahasranama, Chamakam and Rudram. Agamas, the scriptures chiefly constituting the methods of temple construction and creation of "murti", worship means of deities, philosophical doctrines, meditative practices, attainment of sixfold desires and four kinds of yoga are in Tamil and Sanskrit.

Most of the Inscriptions in ancient temples across the Indian subcontinent are in Tamil. Tamil archanas and prayers widely used in temples in South India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. The twelve Azhwars (saint poets of Vaishnavite tradition) and sixty-three Nayanars (saint poets of Shaivite tradition) are regarded as exponents of the "bhakti" tradition of Hinduism in South India. Tamil is also one of the oldest continuously used languages in the world.

Sanskrit is also the tongue of most Indian Hindu rituals. It is an Indo-Aryan language and therefore a member of the Indo-European language family. It therefore has some similarities with Greek and Latin, as well as with many vernacular languages of Europe and south Asia. Like Latin and Greek, it also has secular literature along with its religious canon. Most Hindu theologians of later centuries continued to prefer to write in Sanskrit even when it was no longer spoken as a day-to-day language.

While Sanskrit has often been associated with Brahmanism, it remains as the only liturgical link language which connects the different strains of Hinduism that are present across India. Apart from Sanskrit and Tamil, several Hindu spiritual works were composed in the various regional languages of India such as Hindi (incl. Awadhi and Braj Bhasha dialects), Assamese, Bengali, Odia, Maithili, Punjabi, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tulu, Old Javanese and Balinese.

Kaumaram

Kaumaram is a Hindu denomination that focuses on the deity of love and war "Kumara", also known as "Murugan" (in South India), "Kandan", or "Kadamban", or "Kartikeya". Most devotees of Kumara also revere members of his family: Parvati, Shiva, and Ganesha. The important theological texts relating to Kumara are a part of the Shaiva agama canon. This sub-tradition is found among the Tamils, Kannada, Vedda in South India, Sri Lanka, and among the Tamil diaspora worldwide. The love story of Kumara/Murugan and his wife Valli, a girl from a local tribe, is immensely popular in Tamil Nadu and South India.

Thiruppugazh is one of the important Tamil literary work on Kaumaram.

According to local legends and Tamil folklore, Kartikeya is regarded as a veteran and a guardian of the language that is believed to have been founded by the sage Agastya, with the blessings of Kartikeya. He is considered the patron of the Tamils, due to his worship being widespread among those of Tamil descent.

According to the Skanda Purana, Kartikeya Muruga was the second son of Shiva and Parvati younger brother to Ganesha. According to the Puranic sources, he incarnated as six sparks emanating from the Third eye of Lord Shiva. According to the Skanda Purana, Muruga imprisoned Brahma, protected Vishnu from the asuras and taught the Pranava Mantram to Shiva. Thus Muruga is considered superior to the Trimurti. The worshippers of Lord Muruga are called Kaumaras.

Tamil Nadu has six primary temples for Kartikeya that are known by the name "Aru Padai Veedu", which that translates roughly as "the Six Stations".

Modes of worship include "Kavadi" that is a form of dance, "Alagu" which is a sharp piece of metal that one pierces on the body, carrying milk and water on the heads to offer to the deity and involves a Satvic diet.

Thaipusam is an occasion that is celebrated in Kaumaram. This is much more prevalent in the Murugan Temple in Malaysia. Another chief period of worship is the "Shashti". This is a period of six days when villages in South India with primary Kartikeya deities come together for a celebration. The people involved take a vow on following a vegetarian diet for the period. The six days portray events from the life of Kartikeya. The chief parts covered are the ceremonies in which he is awarded the Spear "Shakti Vel" by his mother Shakthi, the killing of the demon Surapadman, and his marriage.

Other than this, Karnataka, that is another prominent place for Kaumaras, would have its own mode of worship. Trekking the Kumara Parvatha where he is believed to have attained Mukthi giving up his life is popular although not essentially in a very traditional manner.

The primary works in Sanskrit related to Kaumaram are Skanda Puranam detailing the history of Kartikeya and Kumārasambhava, a poem by the Sanskrit scholar Kalidas that literally translates as "The Creation of Kumara" or "the Creation of the Son/Boy".

Adi Shankara wrote a piece on Kartikeya called "Subramanya Bhujangam" .

In Tamil, abundant literature is to be found both in the classical texts and in the folklore. The Skanda Puranam was translated into Tamil. Chief contributors to the classical Tamil texts include Arunagirinathar who wrote hymns of praise with complicated grammar patterns and alliteration and onomatopoeia.

Tamil folk music have hymns written praising the beauty and bravery of Kartikeya. Another chiefly written topic is the way he fell in love and converted his bride Valli. There is a dedicated tune called "Kavadi Sindhu" that is usually used to sing such hymns. This tune became associated with celebrations and dances.

Lord Muruga in his great mercy and compassion responds to his devotees without the need for a mortal guru. He is the Supreme Guru of the Universe and responds to his devotees in ways that suit their consciousness best. There only is one Sampradaya in the Kaumara faith, that which begins from Lord Muruga Himself. Unfortunately, today the Kaumara faith has lost the glory and majesty it once possessed. It has merged largely into Shaivism. However, ancient texts such as the Kumara Tantra and the Skanda Sadbhava Tantra does give significant insight on the Kaumara faith in its original sense.

There's an anecdote where Shiva pretends to forget the significance of the mantra Om and asks little Kartikeya. The young boy astounds everyone by showing Shiva that it is the source of all creation. This earns him the name "Thagappan Swami" or "Swami Naadha" meaning he outdid his father.

Agalychnis spurrelli

The gliding leaf frog, gliding tree frog, Spurrell's tree frog, or pink-sided leaf frog ("Agalychnis spurrelli") is a frog that lives in Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Costa Rica. Scientists have seen it between 70 and 1199 meters above sea level.

Frogs that live in different places are different sizes: Adult male frogs from Costa Rica are 4.8 to 5.6 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 6.0 to 7.2 cm long. The frogs that live in Panama are 6.7 to 7.6 cm long and 8.2 and 8.7 cm long. It has webbing on its feet and disks on its toes for climbing.

This frog is different colors during the day and at night: much of its back is light green during the day and dark green at night. This frog often has white spots with black outlines on its back. Some frogs have green stripes and yellow throats.

This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. This frog climbs up vines by going hand over hand. It can jump and glide from tree to tree by spreading its webbed front and back feet.

The female frog leaves 14-67 eggs at a time. She lays them on the upper side of a leaf hanging over a body of water that is not there all year. Sometimes a male frog will scrape them off the leaf. The eggs take six days to hatch. The tadpoles fall into the water and stay near the surface with their mouths facing up.

Dragonfly nymphs, beetles, and aphids, cicadas, and leafhoppers that live in the water eat the frog's eggs. Green kingfishers eat the tadpoles. Snakes that can climb trees eat the adult frogs.

The number of frogs living in the wild is going down but it is not endangered now. Scientists think its population is becoming smaller because of habitat loss and humans building farms and cutting down trees in the places this frog lives.

Molara Wood

Molara Wood (born 1967) is a Nigerian creative writer, journalist and critic. Currently lives in Lagos and writes an Arts column for "The Guardian". She is also a blogger. 

She was born in 1967 in Nigeria. Her life, as she described, was "a fairly peripatetic life". In a 2015 interview with Oyebade Dosunmu for "Aké Review", Wood said: "Even long before my UK days I had lived in Northern and South-Western Nigeria as well as Los Angeles— all by the age of eleven or twelve. There is a sense in which you’re always out of time, out of place—and the years in Britain merely compounded that. The feeling doesn’t go away with return to Nigeria, it merely mutates, as people remark about me coming across as someone from ‘away’, even when I’m trying to blend in. I am therefore pretty sensitive to the permutations of dislocation and re-integration. London was a huge tableau for me to observe this theatre of human experience as far as Nigerian immigrants were concerned."

She was described as "one of the eminent voices in the Arts in Nigeria".

She writes short stories, flash fiction, poetry and essays. Her works were published in a media such as "African Literature Today", "Chimurenga", "Farafina Magazine", "Sentinel Poetry", "DrumVoices Revue", "Sable LitMag", "Eclectica Magazine", "The New Gong Book of New Nigerian Short Stories" (ed. Adewale Maja-Pearce, 2007), and "" (ed. Chris Brazier; New Internationalist, 2009).

In 2007 her fiction was highly commended in the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association's Short Story Competition. 

In 2008 she won the inaugural John La Rose Memorial Short Story Competition.

Her collection of short stories, "Indigo", was published in 2013 by Parrésia Publishers. "Indigo" was well received, with "Critical Literature Review" calling it "a reader's pleasure".

As Oyebade Dosunmu writes: "Wood tells stories of people who inhabit in between ‘indigo’ spaces: the borderland of immigration, the no-man's-land of multiculturalism and the frontiers of social mobility. These worlds spiral into one another and their inhabitants spin along, negotiating extremes of human circumstance—barrenness, the (fated) pursuit of glamour, madness, death—struggling, all the while, to plant roots in shifting sand." Many of the stories dealt with the lives of African women negotiating concerns such as barrenness, polygamy and widowhood. Wood has said that "these are the writings of a womanist and a feminist. I have a great empathy, a well of feeling for what women go through. I don’t feel these are given adequate treatment in the writings of male writers, so it’s really up to us, the female writers, to privilege the voices and experiences of women."

Wood was a judge for the 2015 Etisalat Prize for Literature. She is on the Advisory Board of the Aké Arts and Book Festival. She also wa a participant in many literary eventsm such as the Lagos Book & Art Festival.

Morelet's tree frog

The popeye hyla, Morelet's leaf frog, Morelet's tree frog, Morelet's frog, or black-eyed leaf frog ("Agalychnis moreletii") is a frog that lives in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The frog has two ranges: one on the Pacific side of the mountains and one on the Atlantic side of the mountains. Scientists have seen it between 200 and 2130 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 60.5 to 64.2 mm long from nose to rear end, and one female was found to be 58.6 mm long. The skin on the frog's back is dark green to light green. It has orange on its sides, inside its legs, and on some of its toes. Its belly is yellow to white. The irises of its eyes are red or purple.

This frog lays eggs after heavy rain. The female lays the eggs on rocks or plants that hang over the water. The eggs are green in color. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall into the water. The eggs do not start to hatch for 9-12 days, and they take 2-3 days to hatch completely. Most tadpoles hatch at night. However, scientists have seen these eggs do something strange: If something shakes or disturbs the group of eggs—for example, a tree snake trying to eating some of them—the other eggs will hatch early. This will also happen if the eggs fall into the water.

This frog is endangered in Mexico because of the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. The fungus has killed almost all of these frogs there. As of 2007, the disease had spread to El Salvador too. This frog is also in danger because of habitat loss (people changing its forests into farms) and because humans capture them to sell as pets.

Paul Schroeter

Paul Schroeter, or Schröter, (26 October 1866 – 1946), was a German painter and etcher.

Born in Kępno Schroeter initially studied in the early 1880s at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where he was a student of Eduard von Gebhardt, Peter Janssen and Adolf Schill. Here, alongside Fritz Overbeck and other young painters of the academy, he joined the Tartarus student association, which also published irregular magazines in which he participated with illustrations. It was also here that he met the painter Fritz Mackensen, who was already well-known at the time. The painter Peter Philippi described 'Tartarus' as "next to the great Malkasten, [... it] was a [...] refreshing [group or] union of young, seriously aspiring artists, among others Robert Engels, Karl Krumbacher, Ludwig Keller, Otto Modersohn, Robert Weise, Paul Schröter, Adelbert Niemeyer, Ernst Christian Pfannschmidt.

From Düsseldorf, Schroeter moved to the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich and joined the Allgemeine Deutsche Kunstgenossenschaft. Active in Munich since 1893, he became a member of the Munich Secession with participation in the spring exhibition in May 1894. Study trips took him to Holland, Belgium and Spain and for a short time he stayed in the , where he met Carl Bantzer, Georg Burmester and Wilhelm Thielmann. From 1898 to 1901, Schroeter lived in Hamburg and became friends with and , the co-founders of the Hamburgischer Künstlerklub. As an illustrator, he produced commissioned works for the Munich magazine "Jugend": 1898 "Haideblume" and "Dornröschen und die Alte" and 1913 a "Vignette".

He had a close friendship with Mackensen, Modersohn and Overbeck, and they persuaded him to come to the still young Künstlerkolonie Worpswede. With his wife Grete and their children, Schroeter moved to Worpswede in 1901, and from there to Horn-Lehe around 1904, where he became a member of the Deutscher Künstlerbund. There, in northern Germany, he painted portraits, landscapes and interior pictures with mostly rural themes. The reviews were not always positive, as the magazine "Die Kunst" wrote in 1903:
In 1908, Schroeter left Bremen, moved to Berlin, was a member of the Verein Berliner Künstler, and lived there in Lichterfelde.

Egg of Columbus

Egg of Columbus is an expression that means an unexpectedly easy way out of a difficult situation.

According to legend, when Christopher Columbus told Cardinal Mendoza about how he discovered land west of the Atlantic ocean, one of the people with them said, "What could be easier than to discover a new land?" To which Columbus offered him a simple task: to put the egg on the table and make it balance on its end. When none of the other people could do it, Columbus took the egg, smashed it from one end, and placed it on the table, showing that it was actually very simple. Seeing this, everyone began to object, saying that they could do the same. To which Columbus replied, "The difference, gentlemen, is that you could do it, when I did."

Historians are not sure if Columbus really did this in real life. They think it is likely that people made the story up many years later.

Girolamo Benzoni wrote about this story in "Historia del Mondo Nuovo" in 1565. Historians think Benzoni might have been the first person to tell the story, but they are not sure.

One reason they think so is that almost the exact same story showed up in another book, by painter Giorgio Vasari in 1550. In Vasari's book, it was the builder Filippo Brunelleschi who flattened the egg. This was to explain how he built the heavy done for the Santa Maria del Fiore church.

In English, people use term "egg of Columbus" to describe puzzles.

Writers Mary Shelley, Leo Tolstoy and others have mentioned the story of Columbus and the egg in their books.

Constraint (mathematics)

When looking at a mathematical problem to solve, there are two kinds of conditions, possible solutions must satisfy: The first kind of condition is directly linked to the problem description, and can be derived from it. There's a second kind of condition, which is not directly related to the problem description. This kind of condition is called constraint. The set of possible solutions which satisfy all these constraints is called "feasible set".

Footpad

A footpad was a type of robber who attacked people who were travelling, they specialised in pedestrian victims. They were common in the British Isles from the time of Elizabeth I to the 1800s. They were thought to be socially inferior to highwaymen (who robbed on horseback), often considered low criminals, opposed to highwaymen who would sometimes become infamous as well as famous. This term was commonly used from the 16th century to the 19th century, but slowly fell out of use.

Footpads always operated on foot, and robbed people after scaring them. Usually operating in the dark, they used this to their advantage by frightening the victim and getting away unseen; some of these crimes were brutally violent, although most commited them out of need and preferred more passive methods. 

They opted for this method due to the high price of horses and the incognito factor of the dark. These activities usually took place in gangs.

Mercerised cotton

Mercerisation is a textile finishing treatment for cellulose fabric and yarn. It is mainly used for cotton and flax. The process changes the properties of the materials: They can be colored more easily, they withstand tearing better, and the fabric will shrink less, when washed. Fabrics treated that way also have a luster which make them resemble silk in some ways.

Sometimes, cotton treated that way is called "Fil d'écosse". Sometimes wool treated in the Mercosett process is also called mercerised. 

The process of mercerisation is long, and relatively costly. For this reason, only higher quality textiles are treated that way.

About 1844, John Mercer developed the process. He noticed that when he treated cotton with solutions of sodium hydroxide, this changed the properties of the cotton: The fabric shrank, and had a higher resistance to tearing. It was also easier to color the material using dyes. 

In the original process of Mercer, no tension was applied. The product was termed "fulled cotton", a nod to the process of fulling in woven wool fabric. For Mercer, making the material easier to color was the most important technical aspect.

Mercer also tried with sulfuric acid and zinc chloride solutions and discovered the parchmentising effect of sulfuric acid.

The silk-like lustre now commonly associated with mercerising is produced by tension and was discovered by Horace Lowe in 1890.

Treatment with sodium hydroxide destroys the spiral form of the cellulose with formation of alkali cellulose, which is changed to cellulose hydrate on washing out the alkali. Caustic soda concentrations of 20–26% are used. Effective mercerization requires the use of wetting agents.

The improved lustre of mercerised cotton is due to the production of nearly circular cotton fibres under tension. Another characteristic feature is the untwisting (deconvolution) of the cotton hair.

In dry mercerization, the process is carried out while drying the fabric on a stenter.

József Antall

József Antall Jr. (Hungarian: Ifj. Antall József, ; 8 April 1932 – 12 December 1993) was a Hungarian historian and politician who served as the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Hungary after the fall of communism. He was instrumental in Hungary's transition to democracy and is considered a key figure in the country's modern history.

Antall was born on April 8, 1932, in Budapest, Hungary. He studied history and Hungarian literature at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest and later earned a doctorate in philosophy. Antall began his academic career as a researcher at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, where he specialized in Hungarian and European history.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Antall became involved in the opposition movement against the Communist government. He was a founding member of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), a political party that advocated for democracy and free markets in Hungary. Antall was elected as the president of the MDF in 1989.

After the fall of communism in Hungary, Antall became the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Hungary in 1990. He led the country during a crucial period of transition from communism to democracy and oversaw significant economic and political reforms.

One of Antall's most significant achievements was his role in negotiating the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary. Under Antall's leadership, Hungary also became the first country in the Soviet bloc to recognize the independence of the Baltic states.

Antall's government implemented a series of economic reforms aimed at transitioning Hungary from a centrally planned economy to a market-oriented one. These reforms included privatization of state-owned enterprises and the introduction of a new tax system. Antall also established diplomatic relations with Israel and initiated talks with the European Union.

Antall's time in office was not without challenges. His government faced criticism from some quarters for not moving quickly enough to reform the economy and for failing to address social issues. Unemployment jumped from nonexistence to 14 percent. Inflation increased at an annual rate of 23–35 percent. Older, retired people, more than one-fifth of the population, suffered the most, and the living standards of more than one-third of the populace declined to below subsistence level. In the meantime, income disparities increased, which irritated the people. Corruption became more widespread and visible than before. Together with the previously omnipotent police force, street security also collapsed in 1990. The crime rate, especially in Budapest, increased threefold in five years.There were also tensions between the MDF and its coalition partners, which ultimately led to the collapse of Antall's government in 1993.

Antall continued to serve as the president of the MDF until his death in December 1993. His legacy as a key figure in Hungary's transition to democracy is widely recognized, and he is remembered as a respected historian and politician who played a vital role in shaping Hungary's modern history.

In recognition of his contributions to Hungary, Antall was posthumously awarded the Order of the Cross of Liberty, the highest civilian honor in Hungary. The József Antall Scholarship Program, established in 1996, is also named in his honor and provides opportunities for young Hungarian scholars to study abroad.

József Antall was born on April 8, 1932, in Budapest, Hungary. He was the son of a prominent historian, Gyula Antall, who was imprisoned for his anti-Nazi views during World War II. After the war, József Antall's family faced persecution under the Communist regime, which forced them into hiding. Despite this, Antall was able to attend the University of Budapest, where he studied history and earned his PhD in 1956, the same year as the Hungarian Revolution. Antall's experiences under Nazi and Communist rule had a profound impact on his political views, and he became a leading figure in Hungary's democratic movement in the 1980s.

After completing his PhD, József Antall worked as a historian and teacher. He also became involved in politics, joining the Independent Smallholders' Party, which had been a dominant political force in Hungary before the Communist takeover. In 1979, Antall was elected to the Hungarian Parliament, where he served until 1990. During his time in parliament, he was a vocal critic of the Communist regime and became known for his advocacy of democracy and human rights. Following the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, Antall played a key role in the creation of the first non-Communist government in Hungary since 1947, serving as the country's first post-Communist Prime Minister from 1990 until his death in 1993.

József Antall served as the Prime Minister of Hungary from 1990 until his death in 1993. He led the first non-Communist government in Hungary since 1947, and his tenure was marked by significant reforms aimed at transitioning the country to a market-based economy and a democratic political system. Antall's government oversaw the privatization of state-owned enterprises, the introduction of a new constitution, and the establishment of diplomatic relations with several Western countries. He was also a strong advocate for Hungary's integration into European institutions and oversaw the country's accession to the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Despite his accomplishments, Antall's time in office was cut short by his untimely death due to cancer at the age of 61.

József Antall was diagnosed with cancer in 1992, just two years after he became the first post-Communist Prime Minister of Hungary. Despite undergoing treatment, his health continued to decline, and he became increasingly weak and frail. On December 12, 1993, Antall died at the age of 61 due to complications from cancer. His death was mourned throughout Hungary and the international community, with many recognizing his contributions to the country's transition to democracy and his efforts to strengthen Hungary's ties with Europe. He was succeeded by Péter Boross as Prime Minister of Hungary.

József Antall is widely recognized as a key figure in Hungary's transition to democracy and market economy in the post-Communist era. His government oversaw significant reforms that paved the way for Hungary's integration into European institutions. He was a strong advocate for the protection of human rights, the rule of law, and the strengthening of civil society. Antall's legacy includes the establishment of diplomatic relations with Western countries and the development of Hungary's foreign policy aimed at fostering closer ties with Europe. His premature death cut short his tenure as Prime Minister, but his vision and legacy continue to inspire generations of Hungarians.

List of cities in Missouri

Missouri is a state located in the Midwestern United States. In Missouri, cities are put into three groups: 3rd Class, 4th Class, and those under constitutional grants. A few older cities are put in under legislative papers (Carrollton, Chillicothe, LaGrange, Liberty, Miami, Missouri City, and Pleasant Hill) which is not allowed anymore. (Carthage is also a Charter City and Charter Cities not made by legislation and are still allowed to this day). The level at which they are put in is determined by their people when they incorporate. They do not change if they gain or lose in people, unless a vote is held by the people.

A municipality gets put in as a 4th Class city if the number of people is between 500 and 2,999 (under 500, it may be put in as a village – see list of villages in Missouri). It may be put in as a 3rd Class city if the number of people is between 3,000 and 29,999. There is more things cities are allowed to do in government for 3rd Class cities than 4th Class.

Mont Toubkal Terk

Mont Toubkal (Berber: ⵜⵓⴳⴳ ⴽⴰⵍ Tugg Kal, also Tizi n Tugg Kal; Arabic: جبل توبقال) is the highest point of the High Atlas as well as Morocco and North Africa with 4,167 m.  It is located 63 km south of Marrakech, in the province of Al Haouz, inside the national park that bears its name.
Tour guide or travel guide is a type of Organizing trips that to morocco treks treks mont toubkal

Historyedit

Aerial view taken in 1930 by the Swiss Walter Mittelholzer.

Technically, the Toubkal does not present any particular difficulties, and has been climbed regularly for a very long time.  The Berbers consider it a holy place, dedicated to Sidi Chamarouch or Chamharouch, and several cairns on the summit bear witness to this cult.  In addition, a sanctuary is dedicated to him on the path leading from Imlil.

From a European point of view, in the nineteenth century the interior of Morocco was still a terra incognita and for a long time Jebel Ayachi (3,747 m) seemed to them to be the highest peak of the High Atlas.  In fact, the first European ascent of Toubkal was on June 12, 1923 by the Marquis de Segonzac, accompanied by Vincent Berger and Hubert Dolbeau.

Tourismedit

Climbing the roof of North Africa attracts a large number of trekking enthusiasts.  This ascent attracts the crowd all the more because it does not present great technical difficulties and the assistance of the mule drivers and their mules reduces physical efforts.  The distance and the difference in level are still relatively important since between Imlil and Mount Toubkal hikers cover nearly 35 kilometers round trip with a difference in altitude of nearly 5,000 meters.  As the altitude is relatively high (3,200 meters at the refuge and 4,167 meters at the summit), the risk of acute mountain sickness (headaches, nosebleeds, vomiting) is not zero, although its effects remain very moderate.  at this height.

Summer is the most favorable season because snow and névé are absent but brief and violent thunderstorms can occur.  The normal route of South Ikhibi is the most frequented.  From the top a wide panorama is offered to the gaze rewarding the efforts made.  It dominates the vast expanses of the Atlas and the great South with 50 km to the south-east of Jebel Sirwa and 150 km to the north-east of the vast ridge of Jebel M'Goun.  We can also see the top of Oukaïmden station.  The tourist wave has changed the lives of Berber mountain people living in the neighborhood.  Many inhabitants now work in tourism: mule drivers, guides, owners, cooks, transporters.  The village of Imlil, the last village accessible by road from Asni, and located just a two-day walk north of Toubkal, is a true "Moroccan Chamonix".  Two shelters are located at an altitude of 3,200 m, 2 or 3 hours' walk from the summit.  Not far from the summit of Toubkal is another attraction, Lake Ifni, accessible via the Tizi n'Ouanoums pass (3,664 m).
Wikivoyage has a travel guide for Djebel Toubkal.

Cabinet of Azerbaijan

The Cabinet of Azerbaijan is the advisory body of the government of Azerbaijan. It is chaired by the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan who is the head of government and head of the Cabinet.

The Cabinet, its composition and its duties are regulated by the Constitution of Azerbaijan.

The Cabinet of Ministers is composed of the Prime Minister, ministers, their deputies and heads of government departments. The Prime Minister and the ministers have to be members of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. The deputies and heads of government departments do not have to be members of the National Assembly.

The Prime Minister and the Cabinet have limited power, and they act as an advisor to the President of Azerbaijan, who is the head of state and head of the executive branch, and has the most power. They and the country's legislature, the National Assembly of Azerbaijan, are subordinate to the President.

The President of Azerbaijan appoints the Prime Minister, the ministers, the heads of the government departments, and all other cabinet-level government administrators. Before they are appointed to their jobs, they are first nominated by the President and confirmed by the National Assembly. If the nomination of a person for the job of Prime Minister is rejected three times by the National Assembly, then the President may appoint a Prime Minister without the consent of the National Assembly.

Although, the Prime Minister normally chairs the meetings of the Cabinet, the President can also chair the meetings of the Cabinet according to the Constitution. The President also has the power to cancel the orders and resolutions of the Cabinet. The Cabinet resigns when a newly elected President takes office and a new Cabinet is formed by the new President.


Blank (cartridge)

When shooting with handguns, ammunition is needed. This ammunition is usually called cartridge. When guns are used in movies, or theatre performances, special cartridges are used. These cartridges are called blanks. Blanks will produce a muzzle flash, and a sound like a real cartridge. They will however not fire a protectile (called bullet, or shot). 

Blanks are also used in historical reenactments, special effects for theatre, movie and television productions, and combat training.

Blanks are less dangerous than real ammunition. There is still a danger in using blanks: Firing a shot will release hot gases. Any object in the cartridge will be propelled outward and may cause injury and perhaps death at close range. 

There is a difference between a blank cartridge, and fake ammunition: Fake ammunition does not contain gunpowder, and will produce neither a sound, nor flash. Fake ammunition is used for the testing if a firearm works as it should. Blanks are also different from percussion caps, used in cap guns. Percussion caps contain only enough gunpower to ignite: as a result, they sound much softer.

The lemur leaf frog or lemur frog ("Agalychnis lemur") is a frog that lives in Colombia, Costa Rica, and Panama. Scientists have seen it between 440 and 1600 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is 30 to 41 mm long from nose to rear end, and the adult female frog is 39 to 53 mm long.

This frog changes color. During the day it is pale green. At night, it is red-brown, lavender-brown, or orange. Its belly is white. The irises of its eyes are silver-white.

During the day, this frog sleeps on the undersides of leaves. It looks for food at night.

The female frog lays eggs on top of leaves hanging over the water. There are 10-15 eggs in each clutch. The frog may lay three clutches in a night. The eggs are 3 to 3.5 mm in diameter, not including the capsule around each egg. The eggs take one to two weeks to hatch. Then the tadpoles fall off the leaf into the water below.

The tadpoles can grow over 4 cm long. Their bodies are gray and their bellies are yellow-pink.

The tadpoles look for food in the water and on the bottom. They take 69 to 98 days to become frogs.

This frog has already gone extinct in some of the places it used to live. This may be because humans have changed the forests where it used to live by cutting down trees for lumber and because of disease. For example, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis.

Rust shooting incident

On October 21, 2021, a weapon used as a prop on a movie set in the United States, shot a projectile that killed one person. Normally, scenes on film or TV where a gun is shot use blanks. Blanks make a bang and give off smoke, but fire no projectile (bullet).

Earlier (and in 2023), criminal charges were made against Alec Baldwin, but the charges were were dropped later that year; The charges of involuntary manslaughter were filed (or received by the court).

The trial of the armorer (Hannah Gutierrez Reed) had a verdict in March 2024. Criminal charges were made against her, in 2023; The charges of involuntary manslaughter were filed (or received by the court).

The death (in 2021) started a debate about working conditions in the film industry, and the use of real guns as props.

There have been reports about workers not being satisfied with working conditions, "and [reports about low safety or] lax safety standards on the" movie set, media said.

The movie has a low budget, of $6–7 million.

During the incident, a gun with a caliber .45 barrel - was used as a prop; The gun discharged, and the camera woman Halyna Hutchins was then seen to be bleeding; She later died. The director of the movie, Joel Souza was injured.

When that gun had been handed to Alec Baldwin, the assistant director said that the weapon was safe to use; [Minutes or seconds] after that, the gun discharged while Baldwin was holding the gun.
"In the commotion after the shooting [... the assistant director] found the weapon [...] on a church pew. He [... took the weapon] to [... the armorer] and told her to open it so he could see what was inside. There were at least four dummy bullet casings [... or cartridges and] one empty casing"; That is media's understanding after talking to the assistant director.

The gun from the incident is a "a long-barreled [...] revolver"; It is an Italian [copy or] reproduction.

"After lunch, the film’s prop master" took the gun out of the safe and gave it to the armorer; That is what the armorer said to the police. Later, the armorer showed the prop weapon to the assistant director "before continuing rehearsal". Investigators say that the movie's assistant director had the prop weapon in his hands, before giving it to Alec Baldwin.

The district attorney of Santa Fe, says that they know who loaded (or put cartridges in) the gun.

In January 2023, criminal charges were made against Alec Baldwin and the armorer (Hannah Gutierrez Reed); The charges of involuntary manslaughter were filed (or received by the court).

The film's assistant director David Halls was charged with a misdemeanor: the negligent use of a deadly weapon; He told the court system that he is guilty; His punishment is six months of probation. The plea deal was approved in March 2023.

The incident [has been] under investigation by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office, and the First Judicial District Attorney (of New Mexico), and New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Bureau.

The movie director is Joel Souza (as of 2021); The producers of the movie are Alec Baldwin, Matt DelPiano, Ryan Donnell Smith, Anjul Nigam, Ryan Winterstern and Nathan Klingher.

The production companies (for the movie), are El Dorado Pictures, Cavalry Media, Thomasville Pictures, Brittany House Pictures, Short Porch Pictures.

An electrician that was on the movie set "has sued producers [...] and several crew members, [... saying that] negligence led to the [...] shooting", media said on November 10.

The parents and sister of the victim who died, are suing (as of 2023) "the movie’s production company and others over her death."

The insurance policy for the movie, has a limit of USD 6 million.

Comparison of American and British English

American English and British English are the two main dialects (types) of the English language. American English is spoken in the United States, while British English is spoken in the United Kingdom. Both types of English are different to each other in some ways, for example in spelling, punctuation, grammar and vocabulary.

There are many words that sound the same in both American and British English but have different spellings, due mainly to the spelling reforms of Noah Webster. British English often keeps more traditional ways of spelling words than American English. For example:


Because some chemical elements have different spellings in American and British English, IUPAC has to use only one spelling of a word in their papers. For example:

Punctuation is the name for the marks used in writing text. Punctuations, for example brackets/parentheses, full stops/periods, quotation marks/inverted commas, have different rules in American and British English.

In British English, "( )" marks are sometimes called "brackets", "[ ]" are called "square brackets" and "{ }" are called "curly brackets". In formal British English and in American English, "( )" marks are "parentheses" (singular: parenthesis), "[ ]" are called "brackets" or "square brackets", and "{ }" can be called "curly brackets" or "braces". These marks are used in the same way in both dialects.

The rules on quoting a text is different in American and British English. In American English, " and ' are called "quotation marks". In British English, " and ' are called "inverted commas" or "speech marks". In American English, it is common to use the double quotation mark ( " ) in direct speech. In British English, it is common to use the single inverted comma ( ' ).

In Croatia, children sing "Ulovi me, ulovi me, kupit ću ti novine. Novine su skupe, poljubi me u dupe" (which means: "Catch me, catch me, [if you do that] I'll buy you a newspaper. Newspapers are pricey, kiss my tushie". Context-meaningful words may be applied ad hoc, such as "Johnny is a sis-sy" or "I can see your underwear!"

Non-taunting uses are also seen, also associated with children. One tune for Ring a Ring o' Roses (which is sung to many variant tunes) uses the "Nyah nyah..." musical figure; a common tune for Bye, baby Bunting uses a similar figure.

Procedural language

A procedural language is a programming language that follows instructions in a sequential manner. Consider the example below:
Go to the market
Buy vegetables
Pay water and electricity bills
Go home
In a procedural language the above instructions will have to be done from the top to the bottom. If one instruction is not carried out the other instructions below it will not be executed.


The above languages listed above are considered procedural because of the manner in which they execute when they are run. Consider one example in C programming:

int main()

/* Output */
// 5 + 10 = 15
As we can see the execution goes from top to bottom. In the event that one instruction is wrong the execution is halted and an error occurs in procedural languages if the error isn't handled.



Considering the above pros and cons is important as you develop projects.

Agalychnis hulli

Agalychnis hulli is a frog that lives in Peru. Scientists have only seen it in one place, but they think it might also live in Ecuador. Scientists have seen it between 270 and 950 meters above sea level.

The adult male frog is about 37.1 mm long from nose to rear end. It changes color. During the day, the frog's back is light green with some lighter spots, and at night it is either darker green or green-brown with lighter spots. This frog lives in tropical forests that are not too high up in the hills. Scientists have seen this frog sitting on leaves about 4 meters above the ground. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over temporary pools of water (bodies of water that are only there for part of the year and dry up at other times). Scientists have not seen many clutches of eggs, but so far it seems that the female frog does not roll the leaf up into a nest the way some other frogs in "Agalychnis" do. This frog does not live in habitats that have been changed too much.

Phyllomedusidae

Phyllomedusidae is a family of frogs that live in the Neotropics in North America, South America, and nearby islands. They are called leaf frogs in English. Some scientists say it is a subfamily of the family Hylidae, the tree frogs. Other scientists say it is a sister clade to Hylidae instead.

The family could be a sister group to the Australian treefrogs (Pelodryadidae), a family of frogs that live in Australia and New Guinea. Scientists think this is possible even though the two groups of frogs live very far away from each other, on different continents. All these frogs could have come from the same ancestor frog that lived in early Cenozoic in South America, where the Phyllomedusidae still live. The two families of frogs would have split from one another during the Eocene period. The ancestors of Pelodryadidae probably colonized Australasia from South America by going through Antarctica, which at the time was not yet frozen over. The clade with both families is sister to the Hylidae, from which they split apart in the early Paleogene.

The family Phyllomedusidae contains the following genera:

LGBT rights in Jordan

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals in Jordan face legal challenges and discrimination not experienced by non-LGBT persons. In the Ancient times of Jordan, according to traditional Biblical accounts, Jewish scriptures and Islamic jurisprudence interpretations was the first place in the world where the same-sex activity was recorded in recorded times of human history, the story told by prophet Lot. However, until recently, the International Day Against Transphobia and Biphobia in 2014 and 2015 in the Jordanian capital, Amman, was troubling, primarily for educational purposes and for the community to raise voice and discuss challenges. Events were being held. LG GTT in Jordan Many activists and members of the Jordanian society and LG GTT allies attended.

In 1951, an analysis of Jordan's Surgical Code legalized the legalization of private, adult, non-commercial, and voluntary physical laws.

Jordan's penal code no longer allows family members to honour kill or maim any member of their family, which is interpreted as "Illegal" sexual intercourse in the whole family. By 2013, the newly revised Penal Code makes unlawful murder, unlawful killing legal.

In 1999, a Jordanian family living in the United States repeatedly murdered their adult daughter and found out she was gay.

Jordan was under the Ottoman Empire, where Homosexuality was condemned by the committee 75 years ago, but between 1922 and 1945 the country was ruled by a League of Nations. However, in 1951 the new nation legalized Homosexuality. The Jordanian government also tolerates a few cafes in Amman that are widely considered to be gay friendly. The revised edition in 2004 has a few provisions of direct impact on LGBT rights. First, the content ban on "sexual perversion" has been replaced with a general requirement that the press "respect the values of ... the Arab and Islamic nation" and that the press must also avoid encroaching into people's private lives.

LGBT history in Pakistan

Royalty of transgender people; Under the Mughal rule, transgender people were called "khawjasaras", a designation of respect and dignity. The Mughals employed transgender people as security officials in charge of female quarters. This role was assigned to transgender people in imitation of their historic role in Holy Cities where transgender people served as facilitators between men and women performing Prayers and Pilgrimage. In most parts of the Muslim world, transgender people commanded respect and were considered holy and special in the eyes of the Lord. The spirituality of transgender people is considered as authentic as that of men and women. The Prophet of Islam treated transgender people with respect, prohibited their ill-treatment, and had good things to say about spiritually-inclined transgender people. Believing that transgender people are dearer to God (The Creator), some Muslim rulers appointed them as intercessors in Royal Palaces, including those of the Ottomans and the Mughals.

In the Indus Valley Region (i.e. Pakistan), the Mughals appointed transgender people to positions of power and trust. Transgender people served as courtiers and councils, giving advice to princes and princesses. They were familiar with court etiquette and knew the secret workings of Mughal households. They were domestic insiders. Having the controls of intelligence officers and the prestige of Royal confidantes, transgender people enjoyed special powers and privileges unavailable even to the most powerful "wazirs" (ministers) of the Islamic Kingdom. Transgender people were educated in statecraft and nuances of religion. This treatment and elevation in the Mughal courts provided a great incentive for non-Muslim transgender people to accept Islamic faith.
The Qur'an is clear on genetic determinations by pointing out that Allah is the:

Every child has the equal blessings of the Lord and there is no justification for parents, courts, or governments to engage in gender-based ill-treatment.

Dhegihan languages

The Dhegihan languages are a group of Siouan languages. They include Kansa–Osage, Omaha–Ponca, and Quapaw.

Kansa and Osage can be understood by each other, as can Omaha and Ponca. 

The 2nd Annual Dhegiha Gathering in 2012 brought Kansa, Quapaw, Osage, Ponca and Omaha speakers together to share best practices in language revitalization.

Six years after the Iron curtain fell, the International Astronautical Federation(IAF) was formed. It was created by European scientists in the field of space research.

Fatalism

Fatalism is an idea in philosophy. It can mean one of two things. First, it can be the idea that people do not have free will to make their own choices, that everything has already been decided in advance. This is called fate. There are a few reasons people think this. For example, some people think free will can't exist if God knows the future. and believing in determinism, that certain starting things cause other things later. For example, geographic determinism is the idea that the part of the world where a person lives determines certain things about his or her later life. The second idea is that people, when faced with something that they don't think they can stop, accept the event rather than try to stop it. The first idea is related to determinism and religion. The second idea is related to psychology.

Cruziohyla calcarifer

The splendid leaf frog ("Cruziohyla calcarifer") is a frog that lives in Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador.

When the frogs are young, just changed from tadpoles, they have bright yellow marks near their mouths and eyes. They have no marks on their back legs.

The adult male frog is 56.4 to 80.5 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 57.0 to 88.8 mm long. The frog's skin is green with some white or light blue spots. The irises of their eyes are pale gray with yellow on the edges. The sides and back legs are yellow with short black stripes and triangular patterns. The front legs and much of the front feet are orange. The throat is yellow. The belly has dark marks on it. This is unusual for tree frogs: most of them have light-colored bellies.

The female frog lays her eggs on the middles of leaves that hang over bodies of water, for example ponds. The tadpoles are different from other "Cruziohyla" tadpoles: Their mouths and colors are different.

This frog is not endangered but there are fewer of them than there used to be. This is because human beings cut down the forests where they live for logging, farms, or to graze animals or build cities. There is also habitat fragmentation, which means the places they live are cut up so that groups of frogs cannot travel to each other. They are also killed by chemicals people use to kill pests.

Cruziohyla craspedopus

The fringed leaf frog ("Cruziohyla craspedopus") is a frog that lives in Brazil, Costa Rica, Colombia, Brazil, and Ecuador. Scientists have seen it between 30 and 1600 meters above sea level.

This is a large frog with green skin and pale spots. It has yellow color on its legs and sides. There are brown bars vertically down its sides.

The adult male frog is 55 to 57 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 69 to 73 mm long.

This frog lives in forest that has never been cut down. It lives high in the trees where the branches come together like a roof.

Unlike other leaf frogs, the female fringed leaf frog puts her eggs right in the water, about 14 to 21 eggs at a time. Scientists once saw adult frogs moving their eggs from the water to a mass of roots hanging over the water. 

People have seen the tadpoles in very small pools of water: For example, in the hollows of trees or in large puddles where larger animals have wallowed in the mud. Scientists think these tadpoles can swim and grow in bodies of water made by humans if there are enough trees close by.

Scientists say this frog is not in danger of dying out because it lives in such a large place.

Pianist's Day

World Pianist Day is a special holiday for both seasoned and amateur piano and keyboard instruments players of all ages and nations. It’s celebrated annually on November 8th.

On this day concerts and meetings with musicians are held all over the world. Pianists congratulate their mentors (and vice versa), friends and relatives of musicians send their congratulations too. “Free piano” events are organized in public places. Numerous music stores offer discounts on their goods.

In 2024 there will be the 10th anniversary of the holiday. World Pianist Day is already celebrated throughout the world: in Latvia, Ukraine, Austria, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Japan, South Korea, Canada, France, Taiwan, the Philippines, Israel, etc. London and Boston Philharmonics dedicated special performances to the holiday. In the U.S. the famous TV presenter Ellen DeGeneres and the legendary “Piano Man” himself — Billy Joel — joined the festivities. Both the number and the geography of events keep expanding, as World Pianist Day becomes truly the global holiday.

The tradition to celebrate November 8th as the special day for piano and keyboard players was founded in 2014 by Ivan Manko-Vertogradoff — cultural activist, piano aficionado and the owner of a music store chain. “I was always dreaming of my friends and clients having their own holiday — simply because they’re worth it”, commented the founder.

Started as just the discretional activity, in merely a year World Pianist Day was recognized as a dedicated holiday. In 2015 pianists Alexander Polyakov, Yulia Arkhangelskaya and Mikhail Orgish took the stage of Minsk State Philharmonics, as did Irina and Elizaveta Morozovs’ duo on piano/cymbalo. Tickets to the event were sold out in six days.

From 2016 World Pianist Day is celebrated internationally. Nanchang Hangkong University in China, where Mr. Polyakov was teaching at the time, was holding the festivities. On Nov. 8, 2016 Nikolai Panok, the Minsk pianist and composer, set the national record for playing the piano for 5 hours continuously. The next year the same performer beat his own record, adding one more hour of continuous playing.

On November 8th, 2018, marking yet another anniversary of World Pianist Day, piano was played at one of the most exotic and hard-to-reach places: the “Apothecary garden”, the subtropical part of the Moscow State University Botanical garden — which was at that time closed to the general public for more than 15 years. The young and talented Ilya Polyakov (not related to the mentioned Alexander Polyakov) played his own pieces named “Colors”.

The question “Why namely November 8th?” Ivan Manko-Vertogradoff replies: “First of all, on this day Alexander Scriabin, one of my most favorite composers and performers, was born. Then, it's a deep and cold autumn time, when people do need comfort and warmth the most — and piano music is able to provide these warm feelings. Last but not least: already after the holiday date was established, we’ve found, with a nice bit of astonishment, that Nov. 8th, or 8 x 11 (or vice versa) is exactly the number of grand piano keys! It is 88 keys to a pianist's soul", concludes Ivan Manko-Vertogradoff.

To make matters worse, Jeff's obnoxious and more successful brother Hunter and his wife, Mei, and son Ollie, have decided to stay with them for Christmas. During an open house, Max Mercer and his mother Carol stop by to use the restroom. Max has a brief exchange with Jeff, during which the latter reveals a box of old dolls, including a malformed one with an upside down face. Carol comments on how dolls with unusual deformities tend to sell due to their rarity. As Max and Carol return home, the whole family is preparing to leave for Tokyo, Japan for the holidays, with Carol leaving earlier than the rest of the family. Max, annoyed with the fuss, decides to hide in the garage parked car and falls asleep.

Concerned about losing their home, Jeff goes to retrieve the doll, only to find that it is missing. Believing that Max stole it, he manages to locate the Mercer household the next day, only to find the whole family hastily leaving. During the commotion, he overhears the security code and sees where the house key is hidden. He tells Pam about it and they agree to go and steal the doll at night. Meanwhile, Max discovers that the whole family has left and takes advantage of it by having fun, though he quickly grows bored. Jeff and Pam arrive at the Mercer house and get inside.

The McKenzies head to church the next day where they run into their realtor Gavin Washington who tells them that they have a buyer, but they need to decide by the end of the year; putting pressure on them. Max arrives and unknowingly converses with Jeff and Pam's son Chris who sympathetically gives him his nerf gun. Jeff and Pam spot Max talking with an elder afterwards and assume she is his grandmother. They resolve to break into the house once again while the rest of their family is still at church. They sneak around the back of the house, but end up in the neighbor's backyard instead. Max overhears them once again plotting with Jeff agreeing to arrive dressed as Santa in an effort to fool him. Max responds by setting up traps in his house while Jeff and Pam wait for their family to fall asleep on Christmas Eve.

Jeff and Pam are subjected to Max's traps, during which they discover that Max did not steal the doll, but instead stole a can of soda. They clear up the misunderstanding, but learn that Max is also home alone and agree to let him stay with them until his mother comes back. As they explain the whole situation to their family, it turns out that Ollie stole the doll and manage to safely retrieve it, thus ensuring that the McKenzies will stay. Carol arrives to pick up Max and, having moved into their house only two months ago, finds friends in the McKenzies and thanks them for taking care of Max.

Bongbong Marcos

Ferdinand "Bongbong" Romualdez Marcos Jr. (born September 13, 1957) is a Filipino politician who is the President of the Philippines since 2022. He was a senator from 2010 to 2016. He is the second child and only son of the president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. and former First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos.

Marcos was also a member of the House of Representatives of the Philippines from 1992 until 1995 and again from 2007 until 2010. He also was the Governor of Ilocos Norte from 1983 until 1986 and from 1998 until 2007.

In October 2021, Marcos announced his candidacy for President of the Philippines in the 2022 election. He won the election in May 2022 in a landslide victory.

Marcos Jr., nicknamed 'Bongbong', was born in Santa Mesa, Manila. He is the second child to Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos and Imelda Remedios Visitacion Romualdez. His parents had three daughters. He had four siblings by his father's first marriage.

In 1970, Marcos was sent to England where he lived and studied at Worth School in West Sussex. He later went to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, to study philosophy, politics and economics; however he never graduated with that degree. Marcos had passed philosophy, but failed economics, and failed politics twice, thus making him ineligible for a degree. Instead, he received a special diploma in social studies, which is awarded mainly to non-graduates. Marcos still falsely claims that he got a degree from the University of Oxford even though Oxford confirmed in 2015 that Marcos did not finish his degree.

Marcos later went to Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, in the United States, which he failed to complete.

In 1980, the 23-year-old Marcos Jr. became vice governor of Ilocos Norte, running unopposed under the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan party of his father, who was ruling the Philippines under martial law at the time. He then became governor of Ilocos Norte in 1983, holding that office until his family was removed from power by the People Power Revolution and fled into exile in Hawaii in February 1986. After the death of his father in 1989, President Corazon Aquino eventually allowed the remaining members of the Marcos family to return to the Philippines to face many charges.

Marcos was elected as representative of Ilocos Norte's 2nd congressional district from 1992 to 1995. Marcos ran for and was elected governor of Ilocos Norte again in 1998. After nine years, he returned as representative from 2007 to 2010, then became senator under the Nacionalista Party from 2010 to 2016. 

In 2015, Marcos ran for vice president in the 2016 election. Marcos lost to Camarines Sur representative Leni Robredo by a small amount of votes. In response, Marcos protested the results. His petition was later dismissed after the pilot recount of the chosen provinces of Negros Oriental, Iloilo and Camarines Sur showed Robredo expanding her lead and therefore winning the vice presidential election.

In 2021, Marcos announced that he would run for president of the Philippines in the 2022 election, under the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas (PFP). His campaign had criticism for spreading fake information about his rivals such as Robredo and for lying about his father's dictatorship. His campaign has also been accused of ignoring or changing facts about the human rights abuses and increase of wealth that took place during his father's presidency.

On November 16, 2021 Marcos announced his running mate to be Sara Duterte, daughter of President Rodrigo Duterte and mayor of Davao City.

Marcos had a wide lead in presidential polls throughout the months leading up to the May 2022 election. He is the first presidential candidate in the country to have poll ratings of over 50% from surveys. He has only attended one presidential debate which brought him controversy. He won the election in May 2022 in a landslide victory.

After the May elections, protests have been formed rejecting the results with many calling Marcos the "dictator's son" and his election as the return of "the Marcos dynasty".

Marcos was sworn-in as the 17th President of the Philippines on June 30, 2022.

On June 20, 2022, Marcos announced that he would make himself the Secretary of Agriculture for a short time to deal with the food shortage crisis in the country.

He and his mother are currently facing arrest in the United States and its territories for ignoring a court order to pay US$353 million in restitution to human rights abuse victims of his father's dictatorship. He and his mother are also facing tax evasion charges and payments in the Philippines since the 1990s.

However, on June 9, 2022, United States Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said that as a head of state, Marcos has diplomatic immunity, meaning he could visit the United States as president of the Philippines without facing any arrests.

Marcos married Louise Araneta in 1993. They have three children.

In March 2020, Marcos was diagnosed with COVID-19.


Criminal Tribes Act

The Criminal Tribes Act was one of the many laws passed by the British colonial government that applied to Indians based on their religion and caste identification.

The origins behind the creation of the act concerned Revolt of 1857 where many tribal chiefs as Dhan Singh Gurjar were labelled traitors and considered rebellious.

The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, expanded in scope through the 1920s, targeted numerous castes in colonial India. According to Simon Cole, a professor of Criminology, Law & Society, the law declared everyone belonging to certain castes to be born with criminal tendencies.

Metaverse

The metaverse is a network of virtual places that are linked into a virtual universe. It is often described as a future version of the Internet. 

In the Metaverse, customizable avatars and dynamic group experiences will enable a new era of social interaction. Weddings, happy hours, and religious ceremonies are increasingly taking place virtually, with individuals participating regardless of their geographic location, especially in the aftermath of COVID-19. Metaverse members will engage with and purchase digital and real-world apparel, sporting goods, and other items through virtual shopping malls. Virtual try-on software and augmented reality (AR) capabilities that help buyers in various ways are a natural fit for this use case. 

The word "metaverse" is portmanteau word of the words "meta" and "universe".

The term was coined in the 1992 science fiction novel "Snow Crash" by Neal Stephenson.

Hyloidea

Hyloidea is a superfamily of frogs. 54% of all living frog and toad species are in Hyloidea. The superfamily Hyloidea started when the ancestor of all its frogs and toads evolved differently from the other animals in the suborder Neobatrachia. This happened at about the same time as the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction 66 million years ago. Scientists have found some fossils from this time but not enough to tell how this event affected these animals. After this extinction event, more forests grew, so the frogs may have changed so they could climb and live in trees.

Hyloidea has many subgroups:

Hyloidea is the largest superfamily of anurans due to scientists placing frogs into this family when the relationships to others are unknown. Therefore, Hyloidea has the highest species diversity. Hyloidea are all tailless, have shortened bodies, large mouths and muscular hind legs. Most anurans in the superfamily have a lateral‐bender which is a type of pelvis morphology found in walking, hopping and burrowing frogs. Some species that appear later in the taxon have a sagittal‐hinge pelvis found in aquatic frogs as well as walking, hopping and burrowing frogs and some have a fore–aft slider pelvis found in terrestrial frogs. Hyloidea anurans lack ribs, have complex mouthparts, and their pectoral girdle can be arciferal or firmisternal. They reproduce via axillary amplexus, and their larvae usually have a single spiracle. The average snout-vent length (SVL) of Hyloidea species vary widely, from 10 mm in one species of "Diasporus" to 320 mm in female "Calyptocephalella gayi". 

Anuran animals, frogs and toads, look alike from the outside, so scientists cannot always tell them apart by looking at their morphological characteristics. They use DNA testing to tell which species are related to each other and how. ML analysis and Bayesian analysis are two important ways to do this. Scientists used them with a nuclear marker toolkit to look at the relationships inside the superfamily Hyloidea on a molecular level. As they tested 55 relationships of the Hyloidea and was found that 53 out of the 55 previously established nodes on the phylogenetic tree were supported by this DNA testing.

Scientists say the first Hyloidea animals evolved on the Gondwanan supercontinent in what is now southern South America, then spread throughout the world. Today, they live on every continent except Antarctica. In 2020, scientists found a fossilized animal that was roughly 40 million year old. The animal was from the hyloid family Calyptocephalellidae, and the fossil was found on Seymour Island in the Antarctic Peninsula. The distribution of Hyloidea species is highly correlated with climate, with most species found in areas with higher annual mean temperatures.

As of February 2021, the IUCN Red List named 361 of the species in Hyloidea as critically endangered (11.4%), 475 as endangered (15%), and 310 as vulnerable (9.8%). There are 3161 species in Hyloidea. One of the most important reasons Hyloidea species are dying is because human beings build farms and other things in the places where they live. This is called habitat loss.

Human rights in Iraq

Likewise, while the Iraqi Criminal Code of 1969 or the apparent 1988 edition do not expressly prohibit homosexual relations between consenting adults in private (a right under a United Nations Human Rights Commission ruling in 1994), scattered reports seem to suggest that homosexuality is still being treated as a crime, possibly a capital crime under a 2001 amendment that technically should not exist. For more information on this topic see Gay rights in Iraq.

Human rights in Egypt

In 2020, Freedom House ranked Egypt as "Not Free" in its annual Freedom in the World report. It gave Egypt a "Political Rights" score of 7/40 and a "Civil Liberties" score of 14/60, with a total score of 21/100. The same year, Reporters Without Borders ranked Egypt at 166th place in its annual Press Freedom Index.

Homosexuality is considered taboo. Until recently, the government denied that homosexuality existed in Egypt, but recently official crackdowns have occurred for reasons felt to include the desire to appease Islamic clerics, to distract from economic issues, or as a cover-up for closet homosexuals in high places. In 2002, 52 men were rounded up on the Queen Boat, a floating nightclub, by police, where they were beaten and tortured. Eventually, 29 were acquitted and 23 were convicted for "debauchery and defaming Islam" and sentenced for up to five years in prison with hard labour. Since the trial was held in a state security court, no appeal was allowed. 

Human rights in Georgia (country)

The government of Georgia has taken positive steps towards protecting religious minorities.

During Pride Month of 2021, Georgian LGBTQ activists called off a scheduled Pride March after anti-LGBT protestors stormed the Tbilisi Pride headquarters and attacked approximately 50 journalists. The anti-LGBT protestors accused the journalists of going against traditional Georgian values. Tbilisi Pride accused the government and church of emboldening a "huge wave of hate" against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community and failing to protect citizens' rights.

Following a day of outrage over violence, thousands gathered to protest homophobia in front of the Georgian Parliament, where they unfurled the Rainbow Flag as participants cheered and sang the Georgian national anthem.

Human rights in Taiwan

Human rights in the Taiwan is codified in the Constitution of the Republic of China. These rights have evolved from the days since the retreat of the Kuomintang (KMT) to the island of Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War in 1949 respectively.

Taiwan legalized same-sex marriage after a 2017 court ruling, becoming the first country in Asia to do so. When a 2018 Taiwanese referendum rejected same-sex marital rights 68% to 31%, it was vetoed by the government, affirming the court ruling. However, adoption of children by same-sex couples is illegal.

Human rights in Iran

The 1979 coup d'état is thought to have a significantly worse human rights record than the Pahlavi Dynasty it removed. According to political historian Ervand Abrahamian, "whereas less than 100 political prisoners had been executed between 1971 and 1979, more than 7900 were executed between 1981 and 1985. ... the prison system was centralized and drastically expanded ... Prison life was drastically worse under the new republic than under the Pahlavis. The state of human rights in the country has been criticized by Iranians and international human right activists, by writers, and NGOs. The United Nations General Assembly and the Human Rights Commission

Homosexual acts and adultery are criminal and punishable by life imprisonment or death after multiple offenses, and the same sentences apply to convictions for treason and apostasy. Iran is one of seven countries in the world that apply the death penalty for homosexual acts; all of them justify this punishment with Islamic law. The Judiciary does not recognize the concept of sexual orientation, and thus from a legal standpoint there are no homosexuals or bisexuals, only heterosexuals committing homosexual acts. For some years after the Iranian Revolution, transgender people were classified by the Judiciary as being homosexual and were thus subject to the same laws. However, in the mid-1980s the Judiciary began changing this policy and classifying transgender individuals as a distinct group, separate from homosexuals, granting them legal rights. Gender dysphoria is officially recognized in Iran today, and the Judiciary permits sexual reassignment surgery for those who can afford it. In the early 1960s, Ayatollah Khomeini had issued a ruling permitting gender reassignment, which has since been reconfirmed by Ayatollah Khamenei.
Currently, Iran has between 15,000 and 20,000 transsexuals, according to official statistics, although unofficial estimates put the figure at up to 150,000. Iran carries out more gender change operations than any country in the world besides Thailand. Sex changes have been legal since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, spiritual leader of the 1979 Islamic revolution, passed a fatwa authorising them nearly 25 years ago. Whereas homosexuality is considered a sin, transsexuality is categorised as an illness subject to cure. While the government seeks to keep its approval quiet, state support has increased since Ahmadinejad took office in 2005. His government has begun providing grants of £2,250 for operations and further funding for hormone therapy. It is also proposing loans of up to £2,750 to allow those undergoing surgery to start their own businesses.

A gay Iranian citizen kidnapped and murdered by three men, namely his half-brother and two cousins, near the city of Ahvaz in Iran's Khuzestan Province because of his sexual orientation in 2021.

Human rights in Palestine

Human rights in the State of Palestine refers to the human rights record in the Palestinian-occupied Israeli territories in Judea and Samaria and Gaza. Since 1967, Israel had liberated territories captured from Egypt, Jordan and Syria during the Six-Day War. Residents of the Golan Heights are entitled to citizenship, voting rights and residency that allows them to travel within Israel's borders. Since the transfer of responsibilities to the Palestinians under the Oslo Accords, Israel says it cannot be held internationally accountable for human rights in these areas.

Gay Palestinians are often arrested and tortured. According to Shaul Ganon of the Israeli-based gay rights group, Aguda, "The PA's usual excuse for persecuting gays is to label them collaborators--though I know of two cases in the last three years where people were tried explicitly for being homosexuals...It's now [since the intifada, when police increasingly began enforcing Islamic law] impossible to be an open gay in the P.A."

Human rights in Jordan

Human rights in Jordan are similar to or better than those elsewhere in the Middle East. Human Rights Watch reported in January 2018 that although recently there have been far-reaching reforms of the laws and regulations in the country, abuses against basic rights such as freedom of expression persisted.

According to Freedom House, Jordan is ranked as the fifth-freest Arab country, but still regarded as "not free" in the 2021 report. It is also classified as having an authoritarian regime according to a 2020 democracy index.

Legal and societal discrimination and harassment remained a problem for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons in Jordan.
Jordan is one of the few countries in the Middle East where homosexuality is legal, provided that it occurs in private, does not involve prostitution, and only involves consenting adults. However, sexual orientation and gender identity issues remain taboo within the traditional culture and the government does not recognize same-sex civil unions or marriages.
Transgender Jordanians may be allowed to change their legal Sex, however Sex Reassignment surgery is required.

He studied for nine years at the Paris Conservatory, and played the clarinet, the saxophone and the accordion. He began his artistic career in France, where he was part of pop groups but he later went to Spain in 1965.

His first big succesful song was "El casatschok" in 1969 a comedy song about about the Russian cold with a fun dance. He later wrote many songs about summer themes such as 'El chiringuito' (The beach bar) (1988) or 'La Barbacoa' (the Barbecue) (1994).

Georgie Dann died on November 3, 2021 during a hip operation.

Human rights in Lebanon

Human rights in Lebanon refers to the state of human rights in Lebanon, which were considered to be on par with global standards in 2004.

A few courts have ruled that Article 534 of the Lebanese Penal Code should no longer be used to arrest LGBT people, however members of the LGBT community are still being arrested, harassed and prosecuted by this law. Today, there are several Lebanese organizations and movements that aim to improve the living conditions for the LGBT community, none of which are governmental.

In 2002, a gay rights organization was started in Lebanon. The group, known as Hurriyyat Khassa or Private Liberties sought to reform the Article 534 of the criminal code so that sexual relations between consenting adults in private were no longer a crime. Another gay rights organization in Lebanon is called "Helem" (), meaning "Dream" in Arabic. This is an acronym for the Lebanese Protection of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender community. These organizations have staged a few public demonstrations, lectures, fundraisers for AIDS education, charitable events and exhibitions of films and have been interviewed by the Lebanese media.

"Anal examinations" were used in Lebanon on men suspected of homosexuality. On 28 July 2012, a gay venue in Beirut was raided by police and 36 men were taken into custody, where they were forced to undergo these examinations. In response, dozens demonstrated in Beirut against these "examinations," calling them the "tests of shame." This practice was outlawed by the Ministry of Justice. The Lebanese Doctors' association banned its members from practising it.

Human rights in Kuwait

Human rights in Kuwait are a topic of significant concern. Most notably, Kuwait's handling of the stateless Bedoon crisis has come under substantial criticism from international human rights groups and the United Nations. Kuwait has the largest number of stateless people in the entire region. Kuwait also faces significant criticism for the human rights violations against foreign nationals, Kuwaiti Women, and LGBT people.

LGBT people living in Kuwait face discriminatory laws and public attitudes. The penal code contains some general provisions against debauchery and immorality that can be used to punish LGBT people.

Foreign nationals infected with AIDS/HIV are deported.

Human rights in Qatar

The state of human rights in Qatar is a concern for several non-governmental organisations, such as Human Rights Watch, which reported in 2012 that hundreds of thousands of mostly South Asian migrant workers in construction in Qatar risk serious exploitation and abuse, sometimes amounting to forced labour. Awareness grew internationally after Qatar's selection to stage the 2022 World Cup, and some reforms have since taken place, including two sweeping changes in 2020.

Sodomy between consenting male adults in Qatar is illegal, and subject to a sentence of up to five years in prison. The law is silent about sodomy between consenting female adults. Sexual orientation and gender identity are not covered in any civil rights laws and there is no recognition of same-sex marriages, civil unions or domestic partnerships.

Human rights in Oman

Oman is an absolute monarchy in which all legislative, executive, and judiciary power ultimately rests in the hands of the hereditary sultan, and in which the system of laws is based firmly on Islamic sharia. Although a report by the U.S. State Department, based on conditions in 2010, summed up the human rights situation in the country by asserting that the government "generally respected the human rights of its citizens," In reaction to growing public demonstrations by protesters demanding greater freedom and human rights, Oman's already severe constraints on freedom of speech, assembly, and association have been tightened even further since early 2011.

There is considerable discrimination against LGBT persons, and individuals engaging in homosexual conduct are subject to prosecution and can be imprisoned for up to three years. In 2009, nine persons were prosecuted for sodomy. Any discussion whatsoever of sexual orientation in Oman is taboo, and LGBT content on the Internet is censored.

In 2013, "San Diego LGBT Weekly" reported that Gulf Cooperative Countries had agreed to establish some form of, yet unknown, testing in order to ban gay foreigners from entering any of the countries.

Human rights in Syria

The situation for human rights in Syria is considered very poor among international observers. A state of emergency was in effect from 1963 until April 2011. This gave security forces sweeping powers of arrest and detentions.

Article 520 of the penal code of 1949, prohibits having homosexual relations, i.e. "carnal relations against the order of nature", and provides for up to three-years imprisonment.

In 2010 the Syrian police began a crackdown that led to the arrest of over 25 men. The men were charged with many crimes ranging from homosexual acts and illegal drug use, to encouraging homosexual behavior and organizing obscene parties. 
In the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), there are Mala Jins (Women's houses) in more than 60 localities where women can seek refuge and demand justice. There the women get support in matters like divorce, rape, beatings and other forms of domestic violence. The women of the Mala Jin, have the authority to speak out banishments. In more serious cases they encourage to file a criminal case. Underage marriage is banned within the territory of the AANES. In 2019 it passed a set of laws further strengthening women's rights.

Human rights in the United Arab Emirates

According to human rights organisations, the government of the UAE violates a number of fundamental human rights. The UAE does not have democratically elected institutions and citizens do not have the right to change their government or to form political parties. Activists and academics who criticize the regime are detained and imprisoned, and their families are often harassed by the state security apparatus.

Homosexuality is illegal and is a crime that is punishable with execution by stoning(if four witnesses testify), imprisonment, fines, flogging, deportation, chemical castration, beatings in police custody, forced hormone injections, and torture by police forces.

Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity

The Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity (MASGD), founded in 2013, is an American support and advocacy organization for LGBTQ Muslims. In 2016, "The Advocate" magazine named four MASGD steering committee members in its list of "21 LGBT Muslims Who Are Changing the World."

The mission of MASGD is to support, empower, and connect LGBTQ+ Muslims. The mission statement goes on to say: "In our work, we challenge root causes of oppression, including misogyny, racism, capitalism, and xenophobia.

Transgender marriage

The legal status of same-sex marriage may have implications for the marriages of couples in which one or both parties are transgender, depending on how sex is defined within a jurisdiction. Transgender and intersex individuals may be prohibited from marrying partners of the "opposite" sex or permitted to marry partners of the "same" sex due to legal distinctions. In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.
In the United Kingdom, the Gender Recognition Act 2004 allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. Support for same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world.

Auto rickshaw

Auto–rickshaws are modernized versions of the rickshaw. They are common in Asia. They have three wheels and generally have open sides. They are often hired like taxis in cities for short journeys. The drivers sits in the front and there is room for 2 passengers. There are also types which carry goods. The first ones were built by Mazda in the 1930s.

Auto–rickshaws are most common in India and Thailand, but are available in many different countries across all continents.

Around the world, auto–rickshaws have different names like cocotaxi in Cuba, or Mototaxi in Peru, Tuktuk in India.

Patrol

A patrol is commonly a group of people like law enforcement officers, military personnel, or private security contractors. These people are assigned to watch over a specific geographic area.

In military, patrol units are sent for gathering information, combat, or both. Outside the military, patrol officers are Police officers are given areas to keep watch over. This is done to know if there are any problems or disputes in the area.

The term need not be so formal, and it applies wider than just humans. Many animals patrol their territory. They may mark the boundary with scent, and challenge any member of the species who enters the territory. This so-called "agonistic behaviour" occurs because resources are limited.

Willis V. McCall

Willis Virgil McCall (July 21, 1909 – April 28, 1994) was sheriff of Lake County, Florida for many years, from 1944 to 1972. He was elected seven times in a row. While he was sheriff, he supported segregation, meaning he supported laws that kept white people and black people apart, almost always with black people getting fewer resources and worse conditions. He enforced anti-miscegenation laws, which forbade black people and white people from marrying each other. He is famous because of the 1949 Groveland Case. In 1951, while he was taking two of the Groveland men to their new trial, he shot them, killing one. McCall said he had shot them in self-defense. He was not charged with a crime for this.

McCall ran for an eighth term as sheriff in 1972, but he lost. Also in 1972, he was on trial for killing Tommy J. Vickers. Vickers was black and disabled. Like the two Groveland men, he died while he was McCall's prisoner. The jury said McCall was not guilty of Vickers' death.

In the 1980s, a road in Umatilla was named Willis McCall Road. In 2007, every member of the Lake County Commission voted to change the name. They said it was because he was a "bully lawman whose notorious tenure was marked by charges of racial intolerance, brutality and murder." During his 28 years as sheriff, McCall was investigated multiple times for breaking civil rights rules and laws and for abusing prisoners. He was tried for murder but was never found guilty.

Willis McCall was born in Umatilla, Lake County, Florida. He was the son of a dirt farmer from Alabama (born c. 1877) and a woman named Pearl (born c. 1886).

McCall was first elected Sheriff of Lake County in 1944. He was re-elected until 1972. "At 6 feet 1 and weighing more than 200 pounds, McCall loomed large as Lake sheriff from 1945 until 1972. He wore a white felt hat, black string tie, and polished boots." In 1972, Guy Bliss defeated McCall in the election for sheriff.

On July 16, 1949, Norma Padgett, a 17-year-old married white woman in Groveland, Florida, said that she had been raped by four young black men. Police arrested 16-year-old Charles Greenlee, Sam Shepherd, 22; and Walter Irvin, 22, and put them in jail until their trial. Shepherd and Irvin were both US Army veterans. Sheriff McCall had traveled out of Florida at that time but he came back the next day. Newspapers all over the United States wrote about the Groveland case, and they wrote about McCall often.

A fourth suspect, Ernest Thomas, ran out of Lake County, so he was not arrested. However, a Sheriff's posse ran after him. They shot and killed him about 200 miles northwest of Lake County in Madison County. The coroner said he could not tell which person in the posse had killed Thomas because he had been shot about 400 times.

As word spread about the alleged rape, an angry crowd of white peoples came to the county jail. The jailhouse was in Tavares. The people in the crowd told McCall to give them the three suspects so they could hang them illegally. But two of the three men were not in the building. McCall had taken Shepherd and Irvin to his own house in Eustis, Florida and he had hidden them in the basement. He then moved them to Raiford State Prison, he said, to keep them safe.

The mob headed toward Groveland, where two of the suspects and their families lived. The mob continued to make trouble. On the third day, McCall and several prominent businessmen warned the black residents to leave town until things settled, and many of them did. McCall called the Florida Governor asking him to send National Guard troops to Lake County; when the troops arrived in Groveland, the mob had already burned several buildings to the ground, including the family home of Sam Shepherd.

A grand jury indicted the three rape suspects. Shepherd and Greenlee later told FBI investigators that deputies beat them until they lied and said they had raped the woman. US Attorney Herbert Phillips did not indict Lake County Sheriff's Deputies James Yates or Leroy Campbell for this.

Later, experts looked closely at the trial. They found it was full of legal problems. Before the trial, McCall had told journalists that two men had confessed. The journalists wrote about this in their newspapers. One newspaper had a large drawing on the front page. The jury had only white men and not even one black person. The jury quickly convicted all three men. The judge sentenced Shepherd and Irvin to death. Because Greenlee was 16 and not an adult, he was sentenced to life in prison. In 1951, the US Supreme Court overturned Lake County's conviction of Shepherd and Irvin on the grounds that it was not right that there had been no blacks people on the jury. (Most blacks were still disenfranchised by the state constitution and racist laws and rules in the segregated Jim Crow state; because they could not vote, they were not eligible to sit on juries.)

This did not mean that Shepherd and Irvin were freed. Instead, they were to have a new trial. In November 1951, McCall was personally driving Shepherd and Irvin from Raiford to Tavares for the retrial. He pulled off to a country road. He said there was something wrong with one of the vehicle's tires. McCall shot both men. Shepherd died there by the roadside, but Irvin lived. Deputy James Yates showed up and shot Irvin again.

McCall later swore in a deposition that Shepherd and Irvin attacked him so they could try to escape. He said that he shot them both in self-defense. But the prisoners had both been handcuffed to each other.

Ambulances took McCall and Irvin to Waterman Hospital in Eustis. McCall was treated for a concussion and facial injuries and Irvin for his gunshot wounds. At the hospital, Irvin met with NAACP lawyers and later told the press that McCall shot him and Shepherd without provocation, as did Yates. In the early 21st century, Gilbert King examined the unredacted FBI files from the case. He wrote in a 2012 book that the FBI had located a bullet in the soil ten inches below the blood stain where Irvin had lain wounded. This supported Irvin's claim that Yates fired at him from nearly point-blank range.

A Lake County coroner's inquest said that McCall had not done anything wrong. Judge Truman Futch ruled that he saw no need to impanel a grand jury, which means McCall was not indicted (formally accused) for any crime. After Irvin recovered from the shooting, his retrial was moved to Marion County, just north of Lake County. It began in February 1952. He was offered a plea bargain, meaning he would get a lighter punishment if he confessed to the rape. But Irvin refused to plead guilty, instead saying he was innocent. The jury found Irvin guilty, and the judge sentenced him to death again. The case was appealed, but the conviction was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court. In early 1954, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

People who believed Irvin asked the governor of Florida for clemency. In the United States, a governor can let a prisoner go even if a jury has convicted that person. Newly elected Governor LeRoy Collins looked at the evidence himself. In 1955, he commuted Irvin's sentence to life in prison, saying that he did not believe that the state established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Greenlee, who did not appeal his case, was paroled in 1962 and Irvin was paroled in 1968. Irvin died in 1969 while visiting Lake County. Greenlee moved with his wife and daughter to Tennessee, where his son was born a few years later. Greenlee lived until 2012.

Harry T. Moore, executive director of the Florida NAACP, challenged segregation and law enforcement. In the 1940s and the early 1950s, he helped tens of thousands of blacks register to vote. Before this, most of the black people in Florida had been disfranchised because of the state constitution written at the turn of the century. After the Groveland case, Moore asked the governor to suspend McCall from office and investigate whether he had abused prisoners. Six weeks later, a bomb exploded in Moore's house in Mims in Brevard County, under the bedroom. Moore and his wife both died. It was Christmas 1952. Rumors said McCall had planned the bombing. The FBI looked for at the time and years later, and the Justice Department looked for evidence too, but none of these investigations found any proof McCall helped in the bombing.

In 2005, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement began a new investigation of the Moore bombing. This was different from earlier investigations, because teams would dig under the house for new forensic evidence. On August 16, 2006, Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist announced his office had completed its 20-month investigation. They named four now-dead suspects: Earl Brooklyn, Tillman Belvin, Joseph Cox and Edward Spivey. All four had a long history with the Ku Klux Klan and served as officers in the Orange County Klavern. The investigators did not find any evidence that McCall had anything to do with the bombing.

In 1954, the Lake County school board asked McCall to enforce their decision to ban five children from a segregated white public school in Mount Dora. This was because parents and teachers in the school suspected them of being "Negro," meaning they thought the children were pretending to be white but were really black. (Under a one-drop law in Florida passed in the early 20th century, anyone with any African ancestry at all counted as black, even if they looked white or if far more of their ancestors had come from Europe.) In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in "Brown v. Board of Education" that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. But many white people in the south did not want to obey the Supreme Court.

McCall visited the Platts' house and looked at the five children. He said they were negroes, and that they were not allowed to go to schools for white students. Official birth and marriage records all classified the Platts as white, and they were said to have Indian ancestry as well. McCall spoke to a Delaware chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of White People later that year and said whites should not allow desegregation of schools.

Because of threats and violence, the Platts did not have their children attend the public school. McCall arranged to have the children enrolled in the Mt. Dora Christian Home and Bible School, a private school. Because it was a private school, it did not have to obey the segregation laws. On October 18, 1955, a court ruled that the children could attend white public school. By then, the Platt family had moved away from Florida.

In 1972 McCall was formally accused of second-degree murder by a state grand jury. They accused him of killing Tommy J. Vickers, a mentally disabled black prisoner. Vickers died in the hospital in April 1972 of acute peritonitis after someone hit him hard in the belly. McCall was accused of kicking and beating Vickers to death after Vickers threw his food on the floor.

Governor Reubin Askew suspended McCall the day of the indictment, meaning he ordered McCall to stop working as sheriff. McCall was put on trial in Ocala in Marion County. Everyone on the jury was white. The trial lasted a long time and the jurors declared McCall not guilty after talking to each other for only 70 minutes. McCall returned to working as sheriff. Critics said that the all-white jury never really thought about the charges or evidence. Supporters of the sheriff said that the charges made against McCall were lies and based on politics. The presiding state judge said he thought the charges brought against McCall were false.

Days after the trial for the death of Vickers, McCall lost his 1972 re-election bid. Lake County had changed during his time in office. It had many more people, including people from the north who had come to Florida to retire. McCall was said to have bragged that he had been investigated 49 times and that five different governors had tried to remove him: "I've been accused of everything but taking a bath and called everything but a child of God," he like[d] to say. He retired to his home in Umatilla, Florida.

In 1985, the Lake County Board of County Commissioners named the road by his house, County Road 450A (CR 450A), Willis V. McCall Road in his honor. More than 20 years later, the South Umatilla Neighborhood Association, a group of black residents on the road, some of whom had lived there for 50 years, asked the Lake County Commission to change the name of the road. They said it should not honor a man who had done so many bad things. Every member of the Commission voted to change the road's name back to County Road 450A.

Late in life, McCall wrote a memoir, a book about his life, "The Wisdom of Willis McCall". He defended his long career as sheriff and answered criticism. "McCall never doubted himself, the usefulness of segregation or the morality of the methods he used to enforce law and order." McCall died on April 28, 1994 at the age of 84.

In 2021, McCall's son, Douglas McCall, was indicted for molesting an eight-year-old girl and for having child pornography. His trial began in October 2021.



Paris Club

The Paris Club () is a group of officials from major creditor countries. Their role is to find solutions to the payment difficulties of debtor countries.

The Paris Club was created gradually from 1956, when the first negotiation between Argentina and its public creditors took place in Paris. The Paris Club treats public claims (that is to say, those due by governments of debtor countries and by the private sector), guaranteed by the public sector to Paris Club members. A similar process occurs for public debt held by private creditors in the London Club, which was organized in 1970 on the model of the Paris Club as an group of banks meet to renegotiate the debt they hold on debtors.

Same-sex marriage in Alaska

Same-sex marriage in Hawaii

Hawaii's denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples was first challenged in state court in 1991, and the plaintiffs initially met with some success. In 1993, a ruling by the Hawaiian Supreme Court made Hawaii the first state in the United States to consider legal challenges to bans on same-sex marriage. However, Hawaii voters later modified the state Constitution in 1998 to allow the State Legislature to restrict marriage to mixed-sex couples. By the time the Supreme Court of Hawaii considered the final appeal in the case in 1999, it upheld the state's ban on same-sex marriage.

Hijra Farsi

Hijra Farsi is a secret language spoken by South-Asian hijra and koti communities. Hijras are a marginalized transgender community living in sequestered groups in many cities of India and Pakistan. The language, also known as "Koti Farsi", is spoken by the hijra community throughout Pakistan and North India (except West Bengal). It is based on Hindustani and not Farsi, as suggested by the name. The sentence structure is similar to Urdu with noticeable distinctions. Hijra Farsi is mainly spoken by Muslim Hijras.

Human rights in Yemen

Human rights in Yemen are seen as problematic in numerous ways. The security forces have been responsible for torture, inhumane treatment and even extrajudicial executions.

Homosexuality is illegal in Yemen in accordance with the country's Shari'ah legal system. LGBT persons in Yemen are likely to suffer discrimination, legal, and social challenges. Punishments for homosexuality range from flogging to death. Yemen is one of only seven countries to apply a death penalty for consensual sexual acts between adults of the same sex.

Gay and lesbian websites are blocked by the government.

As of 2007, there was no public or semi-public space for gays as in western countries. The official position is that there are no gays in Yemen.

As a result of Sharia, LGBT people are killed in attacks. The government does not protect its gay citizens from violence.
A report on the Human rights situation in Yemen since 2014 by the UN Group of Eminent International and Regional Experts on Yemen stated that anti-LGBT discrimination and violence had been exacerbated by the ongoing conflict, and witnesses described cases of arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, torture, and sexual violence.

The US Department of State report found that the government did not consider anti-LGBT violence or discrimination relevant for official reporting. Few LGBT people were open regarding their sexual orientation or gender identity, though those that were faced discrimination. In October of 2023, a student of Sana’a University was expelled after being accused of promoting Homosexuality.

In February, according to AFP, 13 people were sentenced to death for homosexuality at a court in Ibb Governorate, an area under the control of Houthi rebels. The charges were announced on the 4th of February, 2024.

Penal Code 1994, Article 264 Homosexuality
Penal Code 1994, Article 268 Lesbianism
In 2013 there were credible reports of members of the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula were killing men for allegedly being gay.

Same-sex sexual activity is prohibited under the Penal Code 1994, which criminalises acts of ‘Homosexuality’ and ‘Lesbianism’. These provisions carry a maximum penalty of death by stoning. Both men and women are criminalised under this law.

The provisions have their origins in Islamic law, with the Constitution designating Islam as the State religion, and Sharia as the source of all Law.

There is no evidence of the law being enforced by the government in recent years, however reports have suggested that Militant groups have executed men suspected of being gay in areas they controlled. There have been some reports of discrimination and violence being committed against LGBT people in recent years, including murder, arbitrary detention, torture, and sexual violence.

Human rights in Saudi Arabia

Human rights in Saudi Arabia are a topic of concern. The Saudi government, which mandates Muslim and non-Muslim observance of Sharia law under the absolute rule of the House of Saud, have been accused of and denounced by various international organizations and governments for violating human rights within the country just like in America.

LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia are unrecognized. Homosexuality is frequently a taboo subject in Saudi Arabian society and is punished with imprisonment, corporal punishment and capital punishment. Transgender people are generally associated with homosexuality and doctors are banned by the Saudi Ministry of Health from giving hormone replacement therapy to transgender people seeking to medically transition. In 2017, two transgender Pakistanis were allegedly tortured to death by Saudi police. Police later denied the reports.

Human rights in Bangladesh

Human rights in Bangladesh are enshrined as fundamental rights in Part III of the Constitution of Bangladesh. However, constitutional and legal experts believe many of the country's laws require reform to enforce fundamental rights and reflect democratic values of the 21st century.

Tribal people in Bangladesh have demanded constitutional recognition.

Human rights in East Turkestan

Article 36 of the PRC Constitution provides constitutional protection for citizens’ freedom of religion and the country's official ethnic policies also reiterate protection of the freedom of religion of ethnic minorities, but in practice the Uyghur population, predominantly living in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, are subject to strict controls on the practice of Islam.

Examples of these restrictions now include:

Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Chinese government began to label violence in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region as terrorism, unlike in previous years. Chinese counter-terror legislation now makes explicit links between religion and extremism and has led to regulations that explicitly ban religious expression among Uyghurs in particular.

On January 19, 2021, outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo formally declared that China is committing a genocide against the Uighurs and crimes against humanity. In a written letter, Pompeo wrote, “I believe this genocide is ongoing, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uyghurs by the Chinese party-state.” Pompeo called for “all appropriate multilateral and relevant juridical bodies, to join the United States in our effort to promote accountability for those responsible for these atrocities." China strongly denies that human rights abuses are going on in Xinjiang. Pompeo has previously stated that China is trying to "erase its own citizens." On 16 August 2021, a young Chinese woman, named Wu Huan, told the "Associated Press" in her testimony that she was allegedly held for eight days at a Chinese-run secret detention facility in the United Arab Emirates, along with two other Uyghurs. Wu Huan said she was abducted from a hotel in Dubai and detained by Chinese officials at a villa converted into a jail. It was the first evidence that China was operating a “black site” beyond its borders.

Sony Sketch

Sony Sketch was a drawing software created by Sony. It was downloaded tens of millions of times, and was selected as "Editor's Choice" by the Google Play team. 
At the end of 2018, Sony decided to close the project and let everyone in the team go. This was announced to Sketch's users in April 2019.

Sony was still a major player in the mobile phone market in 2013, with the Xperia Z line of models attempting to capture a greater portion of the premium segment. The most unusual phone in the lineup was the Z Ultra, which was so large that it was difficult to fit into your pocket. However, it had an amazing feature: it could be used with any ordinary pencil. Sony developers were tasked with building a drawing app for this new phone.

Sketch's guiding principle was that it should be simple to use. Advanced features were not welcome. Version 1.0 had a 16-color palette and a fixed set of about 40 stickers. There were no layers, text, or online features.

Several times during its existence, the Sketch app was on the verge of being canceled, but the developers persisted. They performed several internal demos that demonstrated the app's potential, including a functional frame-by-frame animation tool with GIF support! Unfortunately, they did not have enough time to complete it.

The first online features on Sketch were a cloud backup and sticker store, which were both popular. Private collaborations were also added. In order for them to work, your collaboration partner needed to have the app, and thus Sketch was launched on Google Play. 

In the app testing forum, art started to appear. To the developers, the thought of art coming to the app was entirely alien to them. They assumed that users would only use Sketch for doodles and stickers. To provide a display for all the creations, the online community was launched towards the end of 2015.

At the end of 2018, Sony decided to shut down Sketch and let the entire team go.  Users were notified of the shutdown on April 23rd, 2019. The team   attempted to buy out the app and continue it outside of Sony, but failed. Despite the app shutting down, more people continued to use it, and community activity increased over the summer of 2019. During the app's final months, more than one million posts were shared each week. 
Sony shut down the online service on October 3rd, 2019. A few days later, it was removed from Google Play and the App Store; however, you can still download it with a link on Google Play on some devices.

A few weeks after the shutdown of Sketch, former members of the Sketch team launched the first version of the Sketchers United website. Sketchers United was made to be a replacement for Sony Sketch.

Human rights in Israel

Human rights in Israel has been evaluated by intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights activists. They are checked often in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the wider Arab–Israeli conflict and Israel internal politics.
Israel is a multiparty parliamentary democracy. It was described in its Declaration of Independence as a "Jewish state" – the legal definition "Jewish and democratic state" was adopted in 1985. 
In addition to its Jewish majority, Israel is home to religious and ethnic minorities. Some of them report discrimination. In the Palestinian territories, successive Israeli governments have been criticized from other countries and international human rights groups. One of the Basic Laws of Israel, aimed to make the basis of a future constitution, , is a major tool for safeguarding human rights and civil liberties in Israel.

Rights for sexual minorities in Israel are thought to be the best in the Middle East. 
Israel has not legalized same-sex marriage. But same-sex marriages valid in foreign countries are legally recognized in Israel. Israel guarantees civil rights for its homosexual population, including adoption rights and partner benefits. Israel also gives a common-law marriage status for same-sex domestic partners. The sodomy law inherited from the British Mandate of Palestine was repealed in 1988. But there was an explicit instruction issued in 1953 by the Attorney General of Israel ordering the police to refrain from enforcing this law, so long as no other offenses were involved. 
A national gay rights law bans some anti-gay discrimination, including in employment; some exemptions are made for religious organizations. In the past, military service of homosexuals was subject to certain restrictions. These restrictions were lifted in 1993, allowing homosexuals to serve openly in all units of the army.
In March 2014, the Ministry of Health stated that sex-reassignment surgery was included among subsidized health services provided to citizens. Despite this, in May "Haaretz" reported that a health maintenance organization refused to pay for two sex-change surgeries. This resulted in great expenses by the patients. 
A national LGBTI task force found that 80 percent of transgender persons, 50 percent of lesbians and 20 percent of gay men were discriminated against when seeking employment.

Human rights in India

Human rights in India is a hard issue in the nation.
The issues are caused by the country's large size and population. For other reasons, there are:
The Constitution of India gives fundamental rights. This includes freedom of religion. Clauses also provide for freedom of speech, as well as separation of executive and judiciary and freedom of movement within the country and abroad. The country also has an independent judiciary as well as bodies to look into issues of human rights.

Until the Delhi High Court allowed private sexual acts between consenting adults on 2 July 2009, homosexuality was considered criminal as per interpretations of the ambiguous Section 377 of the 150-year-old Indian Penal Code (IPC). It was a law passed by the British colonial government. However, this law was very rarely enforced. 
In its ruling to allow homosexuality, the Delhi High Court noted that existed law conflicted with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India, and such ban violates Articles 21, 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
On 11 December 2013, homosexuality was again banned by a Supreme Court ruling.

On 6 September 2018, a five judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court of India, in a landmark judgement, allowed homosexuality.
On June 7, 2021, the Madras High Court ruled that it would take strict action against anyone found attempting to medically “cure” or change the sexual orientation of the LGBTQIA+ community to heterosexual. In its judgement, Justice N Anand Venkatesh also gave directives to educational institutions to sensitize students. Also, it instructed police and prison authorities to conduct programs that not just sensitized police personnel but also ensured non-discrimination of the LGBTQIA+ community.

Sarcohyla bistincta

The Mexican fringe-limbed tree frog or Cope's streamside tree frog ("Sarcohyla bistincta") is a frog that lives in Mexico. It lives near fast-flowing streams and rivers, but it also lives in forests where the trees are pine and oak and in cloud forests. Scientists have seen it between 1219 and 2900 meters above sea level.

This frog's tadpoles swim in streams.

This frog is not in danger of dying out now, but scientists think it could bee if human beings cut down too many trees to make farms and get wood to build with. They think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might also kill this frog, but they have not found any sick frogs yet. Scientists have seen this frog on one ranch. They think this frog might be able to live in places that human beings have changed.

Human rights in Morocco

In Morocco, there has been a greater degree of modernisation. More rights have been given to the people, especially women and children. 
Under the reign of Hassan II, Morocco had one of the worse human rights records in Africa and the world. 
It was worse during the time period of the Years of Lead. This lasted from the early 1960s until the late 1980s. It was a time period in the country's history that was known for political repression. This involved the arrests, detention, imprisonment, and even killings of political opponents. 
Today, Morocco faces at least some human rights problems. They have:

Despite major improvements made under the leadership of King Mohamed VI, political repression is still commonplace in Morocco.

Freedom of religion is generally observed, with some limitations. According to the spokesman for the Moroccan government, "the Kingdom does guarantee not only freedom of worship, but also the building of places of worship for Christians and Jews as well as performing their rituals freely and respectfully.".
It is illegal to proselytize for religions other than Islam (article 220 of the Penal Code, 15 years' imprisonment).
There still exists a Moroccan Jewish community. Although most Jews moved in the years following the creation of Israel in 1948.

None of the political parties have made public statements about LGBT-rights. No LGBT rights legislation has been enacted. Government attitudes towards homosexuality tend to protect the tradition of the country; in keeping with the culture's traditional gender roles and religious mores.

In April 2020, the transgender influencer Sofia Taloni of Moroccan nationality but living in Turkey, followed by more than 600,000 people on Instagram, launched a denunciation campaign to outrage Moroccan homosexuals, throwing to them: "You will burn in hell ". It invites its subscribers to create false accounts on gay dating applications and to reveal the identity of those who are there on social networks. The act questions, insofar as Sofia Talouni is herself from the LGBT community. The sociologist Khalid Mouna explains that she “tries to make her group undergo the same family rupture by adopting the discourse and the codes of her own detractors. This individual, obviously mentally unstable, wishes to isolate young Moroccan homosexuals by breaking up their family unit”. The journalist Hicham Tahir indicates that he has received “a hundred testimonies from people who were victims or direct witnesses of this campaign”. Some landlords ejected their tenants, while one person allegedly committed suicide. Moroccan LGBT associations denounce this homophobic campaign. “Outing or not, the law is against us”, deplores a Moroccan, however, recalling article 489 of the Penal Code which punishes “obscene or unnatural acts between people of the same sex”. The Moroccan police finally launched a preliminary investigation for "incitement to hatred and discrimination". On May 13, Sofia Taloni ends up apologizing in a video. Instagram nevertheless suspends its account

Human rights in Algeria

In 2011, Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who had been in power since 1999, lifted a state of emergency that had been in place since the end of the Algerian Civil War in 2002, as a result of the Arab Spring protests that had occurred throughout the Arab world.

Homosexuality and lesbianism are punishable by up to 3 years imprisonment with fines up to 10,000 dinars, torture, beatings, or vigilante execution.

Human rights in Tunisia

While the immediate months after the revolution were characterized by significant improvements in the status of human rights, some of those advances have since been reversed. The situation remains in a state of flux, with different observers providing virtually irreconcilable accounts of the current status of human rights in that country.

One group that has not benefited noticeably from the Tunisian revolution is LGBT people. "While the fall of Ben Ali has afforded a greater space to free expression, not all Tunisian homosexuals are convinced things are headed in the right direction," reported the Tunisia Live website in January 2012. "Homosexuals in Tunisia celebrated the ouster of dictator Ben Ali, hoping it would improve their situation," noted Deutsche Welle in November 2012, "But in nearly two years, little has changed for the country's gay and lesbian community." Under Article 230 of the penal code, anal intercourse can still be punished by up to three years in prison. In June 2012, Tunisia's Minister for Human Rights vehemently rejected a call by the United Nations Human Rights Committee to decriminalize same-sex acts, dismissing sexual orientation as a Western concept and insisting on its incompatibility with Islam. A large amount of anecdotal evidence suggests that harassment and assaults by police officers and others on LGBT persons continue to be widespread.

There is still no official LGBT rights organizations in Tunisia, although an online magazine for gays was established in March 2011.

Human rights in Kyrgyzstan

Human rights in Kyrgyzstan improved after the ouster of President Askar Akayev in the 2005 Tulip Revolution and the installment of a more democratic government under Roza Otunbayeva. While the country is performing well compared to other states in Central Asia, many human rights violations still take place. Especially LGBT rights have been getting worse in recent years, freedom of press on the contrary has been improving.

Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in Kyrgyzstan, but same-sex marriage is not recognised and even explicitly banned in the constitution since 2016. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people continue to face ill-treatment, extortion, and discrimination by state and non-state actors.

Domestic violence against LGBT minors is a major issue and victims have limited access to government support. LGBT people are often unable to seek protection because of violence and other abuses by law enforcement agencies. Ill-treatment against LGBT people by law enforcement authorities is a systemic phenomenon in Kyrgyzstan according to Kyrgyz Indigo, a local LGBT advocacy group.

Male homosexuality is explicitly illegal and sodomy — defined as sexual intercourse between men — is punishable for a maximum term of five years under the Turkmen Legal code (Chapter 18; Section 35); prior to the 2019 amendment, the limit was two years under the 1997 code. No penal provisions exist for female homosexuality, who along with transsexuals are an invisible category in Turkmen law.

Human rights in Uzbekistan

Human rights in Uzbekistan have been described as "abysmal" [extremely bad] by Human Rights Watch. The country has received heavy criticism from the U.K. and the U.S. The reasons were: possible unjustified arrests, religious persecution and torture used by both regional and national governments.

Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are the only post-Soviet states where male homosexual activity is still a criminal offence.

Human rights in Mauritania

With a July 2012 estimated population of 3.4 million, Mauritania is a highly centralized Islamic republic with no legal provisions for freedom of religion.

Under Shari'a, as applied in Mauritania, consensual same-sex sexual activity between men is punishable by death if witnessed by four individuals, and such activity between women is punishable by three months to two years in prison and a 5,000 to 60,000 ouguiya (US$17 to $207) fine. There were no criminal prosecutions during the year. There was no evidence of societal violence, societal discrimination, or systematic government discrimination based on sexual orientation. There were no organizations advocating for sexual orientation or gender-identity rights, but there were no legal impediments to the operation of such groups.

The Misadventures of Max Crumbly

The Misadventures of Max Crumbly is the spin-off series of "Dork Diaries" written by Rachel Renée Russell. It is about Maxwell "Max" Crumbly's life in middle school, which he chronicles in his journal, which he calls The Misadventures of Max Crumbly. The series is also written in diary format just like Dork Diaries. The series currently has 3 books in it.

Maxwell "Max" Crumbly: The main protagonist of the series. He was first homeschooled by his grandmother until his parents agreed to send him to a public school nearby, South Ridge Middle School. Max is a kind person who is loyal to his friends but he is often a coward when it comes to Doug bullying him. His father is a comic book addict and auto repairman, and has comics worth a lot of money. His mother is a nurse and coddles her children heavily. He also has a secret crush on Erin, but in the books, he tries to deny it.

Max has an older sister named Megan, who often annoys him, a younger brother named Oliver, who has made a few minor appearances in the Dork Diaries series, and a cousin named Wilbur, whom Max often receives hand-me-down clothing from. He is the only person in the series that has asthma and requires an inhaler. Max has bladder issues and has a secret crush on Erin. Max is fully aware about Brandon Roberts having a secret crush on Nikki Maxwell. He likes to rap about his daily life when no one hears him.Like Nikki, Max is also a talented artist. Max's biggest goal in life is to become a superhero. It is revealed in the first book of The Misadventures Of Max Crumbly that his full name is Maxwell.

Oliver: Oliver Crumbly is Mrs. Wallabanger's grandson and possible crush of Brianna Maxwell. He is the same age as her and he reminds Nikki of Brandon Roberts. Oliver seems to be shy at first but he eventually opens up when he starts talking. Oliver has a puppet called Mr Buttons, made out of a sock and loose buttons, but when lost him during his and Brianna's 'play date' he was very upset about it. Although Brianna didn't like Oliver at first they are now considered friends and possible crushes. He even made her a crumpled up, yet cute valentine. In The Misadventures Of Max Crumbly, Oliver scribbled his ABC's all over Max's Air Jordan sneakers with a permanent black marker. He is also Max's brother and his sister is Megan. Oliver has bangs and light-colored hair. His hairstyle is similar to Marcus's. He has a nice smile and wears Mr. Buttons everywhere, like Brianna does with Miss Penelope. He also appeared in the Dork Diaries series.

Mrs. Wallabanger: Mrs. Wallabanger is the Maxwell family's neighbor. She is also Oliver's and Max's grandmother. She has trouble hearing and she also appeared in the Dork Diaries series. She also has a Yorkshire Terrier dog named Creampuff.

Doug Thurston aka Thug: Doug Thurston aka Thug is the main antagonist in the series. He is considered rude, crude, unpolite, and a bully by the main character, Max Crumbly, in the book series. Not much is known about Doug besides the fact that he is always mean to Max and repeatedly tries to make Max's life miserable. His character is analogous to MacKenzie Hollister's in the Dork Diaries series. He has a blatant crush on Erin Madison, the female counterpart of Brandon Roberts, in the Max Crumbly book series. Doug does everything he can to embarrass Max in front of Erin and desperately tries to woo her in order to gain her affections, but Erin does not return his feelings. Doug is depicted with straight hair, possibly black, and a unique eye shape. His eye shape has never been seen on another character, hinting that he may be Asian. Doug's specific appearance, such as eye and hair color, is not touched on by the books.

Megan: Megan Crumbly is the sister of Max and Oliver Crumbly and Oliver, and is one of the characters in The Misadventures Of Max Crumbly series.

Erin Madison: Erin Madison is the female protagonist of The Misadventures of Max Crumbly. She is mentioned in one of Nikki’s blogs. Erin Madison is one of the most popular girls at South Ridge Middle School, being that she is highly intelligent and headstrong. Despite her popularity, Erin seems to show genuine concern and is kind towards Max Crumbly. She is very well-spoken and speaks her mind no matter what others think. Max Crumbly has a crush on her but it is still unknown whether she returns those same feelings. Doug "Thug" Thurston also has a crush on her, but she is not impressed by him at all.
She stared at Max when Max stared at her. She helped Max with his papers when he dropped them. She was impressed by one of his pictures and told him to paint for the school play "The ice princess".

She's the princess, and the audience. She was worried the play would be canceled which became true one day. Then Thug bumped into Max and she got mad and stood up to him until he said sorry. Thug is hinted to have feelings for Erin when he said that he likes magenta which is her favorite color. When the play was announced cancelled, she was very sad and acted rude to Max, scolding him when he asked if he could help. later, she freed Max from his locker and explained why she was so sour. Later, when Max was lost, he grabbed a phone.

The person on the other side was Erin, who accused Max of stealing cell phones and prank calling her. she said she didn't trust him and he was probably a few fries short of a Happy Meal. But, she will help him as he's her friend. She made a deal that if he hung up and won't let him help her she'll call 911. she told Max to get a trophy with a password on it. She got a new cell phone and told Max "Thanks for the password." Later, Max wondered if she could actually help him.

In Book 2, Max said he wanted Erin as a superhero sidekick.

He denied that he wasn't crushing on her even though he is. Max again wonders if Erin can help him. Later, Max thought that she was horrified and said "No! Max!" Later, Erin called Max because the phone started singing, "Girl, we have a connection! I love you more that my Lego collection!" She later confessed that she did call him and when he didn't answer, she shut the lights off. Max said she was his only friend. She said she liked him as a friend and she turned the lights off again so the burglars won't steal the computers. Then she told Max to call her on video chat. He job is to take the burglar's whereabouts and distract them to make sure Max survives. She insisted that they stay every minute on the phone. She said he can use it to call her for 40 minutes and use the last 5 minutes to call his parents.

If Max doesn't agree with her, she'll call the police and his parents now and she'll never forgive herself if anything happens to Max and she doesn't want to get expelled and ruin her chance to go to a university for helping Max break 39 school rules. Max eventually agreed to Erin. Then, she heard Max's tummy rumbling and questions what it is. Then, she said she doesn't want to know. Max told her she hasn't eaten in hours and is starving. Erin gave her locker combo and told him to go and get some cookies. Max had a flashback that on School Spirit Day, he ate green things and she told Max he was eating mold and was horrified when Max was feeling well and almost threw up on her. But luckily, he ran away before he could do so. In the kitchen, she agreed Max can use the mold, food poisoning, vomit and diarrhea to the burglars and should call it Operation Fuzzy Burger.

She told Max they could also get the slimy chicken soup and Erin told him to cook fast and his battery to down to 39 minutes.

She then told Max the burglars took candles and was going to rob the computers when she turned on the sprinklers. She said the cookies were so good, she can eat an entire box. Then, she went away for a minute to go to the bathroom. When she came back, Max had defeated one robber (Moose) and she was shocked the plan actually worked. Later, she suggested Max to send Tucker an invitation to the gym. Max did and she turned the fan switch and made him hang high in the air.

She suggested to defeat Ralph, they should use her 8th grade honors biology classroom and she said she has an A+ on her biofuel rocket she built. Then her parents came in and said they told Erin that she can't use any technology after 9 PM and her punishment is that she's grounded for a week and they're taking away her laptop.

She lied that she was working on a big school project. Then her dad hung up on Max. Max said that if Erin hadn't been grounded, Max could've defeated Ralph easily. Later, had to hack her dad's work computer to see what's happening at school. Then, she got dressed, disconnected the burglar alarm and rode to school with her bike. She then stood over the brick wall of the school. She told Max that he wouldn't die. She said she called the cops and they had to leave before they came because she's afraid her parents would ground her until her 21st birthday. She then asked why Max was wearing her Ice Princess costume and Max attempted to use a Jedi Mind Trick on her.

Erin pretended to fall for it and laughed. She said Max would make a great Elsa. Then she told Max to grab her backpack and they'll escape. Unfortunately, her backpack can't hold Max's weight, leaving a screaming Erin to fall into the dumpster. She started complaining about the terrible smell. She started panicking and wondering how'd they get out of the school and they'd both get kicked out. Then Erin started annoying him and said it's his fault. Max retorts it's mostly Erin's.

Then Max wonders if they'll escape and continue their secret life fighting crime or get arrested by the authorities and get expelled from the school for breaking 73 school rules.

In blog posts, Erin was mentioned when Thug read Max's journal and threatened to give it to Erin. On St. Patrick's Day, she told Max he was eating mold and got scared when Max started feeling unwell. That concept was used in the 2nd book as well. Later, in another journal, Max said that she was going to know him better and found out he smelled like lavender tide, almost as good as a new computer.

Mr. Crumbly and Mrs. Crumbly: Max's parents.

Mr. Madison: Erin's dad.

Mrs. Madison: Erin's mom.

Principal Smith: The principal of South Ridge Middle School.

Human rights in Tatarstan

The member organisations of the House [What house? undefined term] work on a range of issues including prison conditions; police abuse; access to medical treatment; violence in the army; domestic violence and the conditions for children in institutional care. The House members have a thematic focus on the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. With member organisations that have worked together since 2009, Human Rights House Kazan was already a well-established human rights centre in Czarist Russia when it joined the network of Human Rights Houses in 2019.

Perestroika helped in the rebirth of Tatar nationalism, which had first flourished during the October Revolution. From the late 1980s, Tatarstan was at the forefront of the movement for regional autonomy. Tatarstan declared sovereignty on 30 August 1990. A referendum held on 21 March 1992 on the transformation of Tatarstan into an independent republic won wide support. The Tatarstan authorities refused to sign the Federation Treaty (March 1992). Particular efforts have been made to build links with the Tatar diaspora. The Constitution of 1992 allowed for dual citizenship and for two state languages. In 1992-3 a number of organizations, including the Tatar Public Opinion Centre, demanded outright independence for the republic. The main nationalist drive was not, however, for full independence but rather for associative membership of the Russian Federation. The wide dispersal of Tatars – in 1989 only 32 per cent of Russia’s 5.5 million Tatars lived in Tatarstan – prevented Kazan’s campaign for power from turning into a struggle for ethno-national liberation. The Tatarstan authorities signed a historic power-sharing agreement with Moscow on 15 February 1994 that granted the republic important rights of self-government, the right to retain a substantial share of federal taxes collected in Tatarstan and for republican legislation to supersede federal law in some cases. The treaty nonetheless fell short of recognizing Tatarstan as an independent entity in international law.

Following the Soviet collapse Tatars have consolidated their demographic position within the Republic of Tatarstan, forming an absolute majority for the first time in the 2002 census. Ethnic Tatars have generally been over-represented in Tatarstan’s political institutions in the post-Soviet period. Contact with the Tatar diaspora abroad also increased.

Russian imperialists is notorious for its laws against "gay propaganda," which have resulted in a spate of show trials against LGBT activists. The researcher at Human Rights Watch, said that Tatar authorities have made derogatory and aggressive statements against LGBT groups. The LGBT community in Tatarstan, however, keeps a low profile and has always opposed the continued unjust annexation of their country, since the late 1980's.

Islam in Tatarstan

Islam in Tatarstan existed prior to the tenth century, but it began major growth in 922, when Bulgar ruler Almış converted to Islam. This was followed by an increase in missionary activity in Volga Bulgaria. Islam remained the dominant religion through the Mongol invasion and subsequent Khanate of Kazan. 

Today, Islam is a major faith in Tatarstan, adhered to by to 53 percent of the estimated 3.8 million population, making it the largest religion.

Ghurid dynasty

The Ghūrids, or Ghorids (; self-designation: , "Shansabānī"), were a Sunni Muslim dynasty of Iranian origin from the Ghor region of present-day central Afghanistan, but the exact ethnic origin is uncertain although they are commonly said to have been Tajiks. The dynasty converted to Sunni Islam from Buddhism after the conquest of Ghor by the Ghaznavid sultan Mahmud of Ghazni in 1011. The dynasty overthrew the Ghaznavid Empire in 1186 when Sultan Mu'izz ad-Din Muhammad of Ghor conquered the last Ghaznavid capital of Lahore.

Jean Pierson

Jean Pierson (17 November 1940 – 3 November 2021) was a Tunisian-born French engineer. He was known for working in the Concorde program and the creation of Airbus.

Pierson was born on 17 November 1940 in Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. He studied at the Prytanée national militaire and the military academy in La Flèche, France, and graduated from the Institut supérieur de l'aéronautique et de l'espace in 1963. His started his career in 1963 at Sud Aviation, the predecessor of Airbus Industrie, where he worked as a production engineer. He joined French aerospace manufacturer Aérospatiale in 1972, going on to head their commercial aircraft business. From 1972 to 1976, Pierson served as director of SOCATA, the light aircraft division of Aérospatiale, and then as director of the Toulouse office of Aérospatiale from 1976 to 1983.

Pierson succeeded Bernard Lathière as managing director of Airbus in March 1985. Lathière had lost his job due to a conflict between the German and French shareholders of the company. At the time, Airbus was not a significant competitor to the then market leader, Boeing, which held a more than seventy percent market share in the commercial jetliner market. Airbus was often dismissed by market leader Boeing as a "minor nuisance" whose primary charter was to drive European jobs. Pierson's actions as leader included broadening the company's range of commercial jets and establishing a brand that could compete on quality. In a move to break into the U.S. commercial aviation market, Pierson recruited native-English talent and had a former US Transportation Secretary, Alan S. Boyd, take position as the North American leader. He also set up a pilot training centre in Florida as a finishing school for pilots of Airbus jets. In one of Airbus's first big wins, Northwest Airlines, which would later merge with Delta Air Lines, ordered 100 Airbus A320 jets. In another big win, US Airways, which later merged with American Airlines, placed an order for 400 jets in 1997. Pierson is famously known to have unbuckled his belt and dropped his trousers when at the last minute, a discount was demanded by the airline's CEO Stephen Wolf. Wolf is said to have ended the negotiation at that point, and signed the contract for 400 jets.

Pierson died on 3 November 2021, two weeks before his 81st birthday.

Human rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina

International non-government organisation Human Rights Watch identified in its Annual Report for 2020 that discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities remains a significant human rights issue in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian constitution prohibits ethnic minorities such as the Jewish people and the Roma people, which are the two largest minority groups in the country, from running for presidency.

Same-sexual activity is legal in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Same sex marriage and relationships are not legally recognised under Bosnian law. Transgender persons are allowed to change their legal gender. In the United Nations Human Rights Council's 2019 report on Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Human Rights Committee and the Committee Against Torture expressed concern at the lack of investigation by authorities of hate crimes committed towards lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Homophobia and violence and hate crimes against members of the LGBT community is widespread in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In September 2008, seven civilians and a police officer were injured by anti-LGBT protestors at the Queer Festival Sarajevo. The organisers of the festival received anonymous death threats leading up to the festival. Six people were hospitalised with head injuries and one of the attackers was detained by police. In September 2019 Bosnia's first LGBT pride parade was held in Sarajevo, the country's capital city. One thousand police officers were present to protect the protestors from violence and hate crimes. Counter-protests were held in Sarajevo by anti-LGBT groups at the same time as the Pride parade.

Human rights in Albania

Current issues concerning human rights in Albania include domestic violence, isolated cases of torture, and police brutality, the general condition of prisons, human and sex trafficking and LGBT rights.

Studies on religion in the Western Balkans show that Homosexuality is perceived to be a unifying enemy promoted by Western values. The more that sexual diversity is defended by the West, the more resistance may emerge against LGBTI people's human rights. There are no faith-based groups providing support to LGBTI people.

Human rights in Sudan

Sudan's human rights record has been widely condemned. Some human rights organizations have documented a variety of abuses and atrocities carried out by the Sudanese government over the past several years under the rule of Omar al-Bashir.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Sudan face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity has been illegal in Sudan, with sentences including but not limited to capital punishment. However, in July 2020, the sodomy law that previously punished gay men with up to 100 lashes for the first offence, five years in jail for the second and the death penalty the third time around was abolished, with new legislation reducing the penalty to prison terms ranging from five years to life. Sudanese LGBT+ activists hailed the reform as a 'great first step', but said it was not enough yet, and the end goal should be the decriminalisation of gay sexual activity altogether.

Human rights in Kosovo

The aftermath of the 1998–1999 armed conflict in Kosovo continues to bring with it enormous human rights challenges, and transitional justice efforts must be approached with a human rights lens, the report advises.

Following its publication, the report’s findings and recommendations were officially presented to the Assembly of Kosovo Committee for Human Rights, Gender Equality, Victims of Sexual Violence of War, Missing Persons, and Petitions (Committee) during a dedicated session in June 2021. The Committee welcomed its publication and congratulated the contributing NGOs on their commitment and work to advance human rights in Kosovo.

Human rights in Armenia

Human rights in Armenia tend to be better than those in most former Soviet Republics and have drawn closer to acceptable standards, especially economically. Still, there are several considerable problems.

Homosexuality has been legal in Armenia since 2003. However, even though it has been decriminalized, the situation of local lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) citizens has not changed substantially. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in Armenia have yet to be claimed and acquired. Homosexuality remains a taboo topic in parts of Armenian society as the nation trails other European nations in promoting LGBT rights. There is, moreover, no legal protection for LGBT persons whose human rights are violated regularly.

LGBT rights in Armenia

Homosexuality has been legal in Armenia since 2003. However, even though it has been decriminalized, the situation of local lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) citizens has not changed substantially. Many LGBT Armenians fear being socially outcast by their friends and families, causing them to keep their sexual orientation or gender identity secret, except to a few family members and friends.

Human rights in Nigeria

Human rights in Nigeria are protected under the current constitution of 1999. While Nigeria has made major improvements in human rights under this constitution. The Restrictions of LGBTIQ rights and government corruption continue to undermine the status of human rights in Nigeria.

Sometimes the work is conceived from the beginning as a multiple-film work – for example, the "Three Colours" series – but in most cases the success of the original film inspires further films to be made. Individual sequels are relatively common, but are not always successful enough to spawn further installments.

The 25 films (as of 2021) of the Marvel Cinematic Universe form the highest grossing film series even when adjusted for inflation, surpassing J. K. Rowling's Wizarding World (10 films) "Star Wars" (11 films), Ian Fleming's James Bond (25 films), and J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth (6 films) series.

His team places last and are relegated to the "Second Chance Tournament", where Greg is traded out (once again) to the opposition in the finals; where he wins the game for the opposition after chucking a 3-pointer.

Wisconsin's 3rd congressional district is a congressional district in Wisconsin. It has been represented by Democrat Ron Kind since 1997. It is located in western Wisconsin, along the Minnesota-Wisconsin border. The district has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+4, meaning it is roughly four points more conservative than the country.

With popular Representative Kind having announced his retirement, some think the district will elect a Republican representative in 2022 for the first time in the 21st century.

Gokyo Lakes

Gokyo Lakes are lakes in Nepal's Sagarmatha National Park. They are located at the height of above sea level. These lakes make the world's highest freshwater lake system with six main lakes. Among them Thonak Lake is the largest. In September 2007, Gokyo and sorrounding wetlands of were made into a Ramsar site.

Gokyo Lakes are located in Khumjung, a village of Solukhumbu District in Sagarmatha Zone in north-eastern Nepal. Gokyo Cho, also called Dudh Pokhari, is the main lake with an area of . At the eastern shore of this lake is Gokyo village. Thonak Cho is the largest lake with an area of . Gyazumpa Cho is in size, while Tanjung Cho has an area of , and Ngojumba Cho has an area of .

As sources of permanent fresh water they have high hydrological value. They get water from various sources, such as water that flows underground from the Ngozumpa glacier, a stream coming from the Renjo La pass from north-west, and another stream coming from the Ngozumpa glacier in the east. These wetlands are filled with water from many glaciers.

The water from there goes to the Dudh Kosi through the Taujon Lake and the Longabanga Lake. These lakes are deeper than researchers use to believe. Fourth Lake (Thonak Cho) is the deepest lake which is 62.4 m deep. After that is the Gokyo Lake which is 43 m deep. A direct connection between the Gokyo Lake and the upper Thonak Cho and the Ngozumpa Cho has not been seen. However, these lakes may be connected through an underground water supply. The Gokyo lake system is naturally at risk, as it is in an ecologically risky and unstable zone. The outburst of the Ngozumpa glacier is always a danger to the existence of the lakes.

The Gokyo lake system of 19 lakes is covers an area of and is at the hight between . The wetland lies at the start of of the Dudh Kosi river, which flows down from Cho Oyu.

The Gokyo Lakes are considered sacred by both Hindus and Buddhists. About 500 Hindus take a holy bath in the lakes during the Janai Purnima festival, which usually occurs in the month of August. On average 7,000 tourists visit the Gokyo Lakes every year. The site is worshipped as the residing place of 'Nag Devata' (Snake God). A temple of the Hindu gods Vishnu and Shiva is at the western corner of the lake. The belief that birds and wildlife should not be harmed has protected the animals in this region for a long time.

Gokyo is among the most popular places for tourist to visit. From there, people can go towards the Sagarmatha base camp and other areas. Gokyo village at height is a major centre in the area. The site is two days' walk uphill from Namche Bazaar. A visit to the area usually includes climbing Gokyo Ri.

The Gokyo Lakes are also part of a longer Everest Base Camp trek known as the EBC trek through the Gokyo Lakes. This trek is commonly hiked by people with slightly more time to trek as the path is 4 days longer than the usual EBC trek. The Gokyo Lakes trek also has the benefit of being a circular route, unlike the usual EBC trek where people return using the same path.

London Southend Airport

Global figures show, London Southend Airport (IATA Code: SEN) welcomed 2,035,535 (Wikipedia) passengers through its doors in 2019. The airport itself sits to the north of Southend-on-Sea, separated from the town of its namesake by the A127, which joins the M25 at junction 29, north of the Dartford Thames river crossing. 

Most aircraft operating at the airport are mostly short regional flights or short-haul international flights to destinations such as the north of Spain, Bilbao and the south of France. Most Aircraft are operated by either EasyJet, and their small A320NEO family aircraft and Flybe, who operate turboprop aircraft that have a maximum capacity of just over 60 people. Therefore, due to the airport's short runway, much like London City Airport's (IATA Code: LCY), larger wide-bodied aircraft produced to serve long-haul routes, such as the A350, A380, Boeing 747 and Boeing 777, are unable to land at the airport. As a result, the airport is limited by the runway size, along with it's sole terminal's floor space to become a destination to many more tourists from around the United Kingdom and the rest of the World. 

Another limiting factor is it's accessibility from central London, as larger airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Stanstead are easier and quicker to access due to the infrastructure already in place, such as the M25, M23 and M11 respectively, whereas the A127 doesn't have the capacity of the M25 or M23, due to its 2 lanes and 50 mph national speed limit. Southend Airport's location puts it at a great disadvantage too, as many larger airports are closer to the touristic hub of central London, as tourists and visitors have greater ease of access to central London.

Steakhouse

A steakhouse, steak house, or chophouse refers to a restaurant that specializes in steaks and chops. They are found mainly in North America. Modern steakhouses may also carry other cuts of meat including poultry, roast prime rib, and veal, as well as fish and other seafood.

Chophouses started in London in the 1690s and served individual portions of meat, known as chops. The traditional nature of the food served was maintained through the later 19th century despite the new cooking styles from the Continent, which were becoming fashionable. The houses were normally only open for men.

The steakhouse started in the United States in the mid-19th century as a development from traditional inns and bars. Steakhouses can be casual or formal fine dining restaurants.

The oldest chophouse in London Simpson's Tavern is regarded as an institution of London and retains its 19th century decor. The oldest continuously operating steakhouse in the United States is the Old Homestead Steakhouse in New York City, established in 1868. Prior to that there were chophouses in New York City such as Cobweb Hall, owned by David Pattullo, which was known for their mutton chops and offered additional menu options such as beefsteaks, lamb kidneys, bacon, and potatoes.

Today, steakhouses are found throughout the USA.

Dhaka topi

The Dhaka topi ( ), is a hat which is popular in Nepal among Nepalis and North Indian states of Sikkim and Assam, including Darjeeling and Dehradun among Sikkimese and Indian Gorkhas. It is a part of Nepalese and Indian-Gorkha national dress, worn by men on celebrations snd and festivals.

"Dhaka ko Topi" in Nepali means a "hat made of Dhaka cloth". Dhaka cloth is fine cotton cloth that used to be imported from Dhaka, the current capital of Bangladesh.

The Dhaka topi was a part of the Nepalese national dress, and a symbol of Nepalese nationality. It became popular during King Mahendra's rule between 1955 and 1972. Back then people needed to wear Dhaka topi for official photographs for passports and documents. It was also worn by government officials as a part of the national dress. In the times of king Mahendra, Dhaka topis were available for rent near the Singha Durbar in Kathmandu. The badge of kukri cross is worn on the cap mostly by officials in Kathmandu or when a Nepalese visit the Palace. It is not worn by the lay Nepali.

Dhaka clothing is no longer a part of Nepalese fashion, but it is still an important part of society and Nepalese identity. They are also given away as gifts during Dashain and Tihar festivals. These days many Nepalis rarely wear a cap unless they are attending some cultural programme. However, many older men and women still wear clothes made from Dhaka. People wearing Dhaka topi are still commonly seen on the streets of Kathmandu. Dhaka cloth still plays a role in rituals, such as weddings and funerals of many ethnic groups living in the Kathmandu valley. Even though there are many places producing these hats, they still have a hard time producing enough for all the buyers.

International Nepali Dhoti and Topi Day is celebrated by Nepali people around the world on 1 January. In this day people wear Dhaka topi as their pride to promote the culture. Nepali people from Madhesi and Tharu community wear Dhoti, while other wear Dhaka and Bhadgaunle topis on that day. There are more people wearing topi than dhoti in this day. Madhesi people use this day as an opportunity to promote their culture. Madhesis and Sikhs in Nepal are often discriminated against because of they usually don't wear Dhaka topi.

"Dhaka" is one of the most popular cotton textile in Nepal. They usually have various coloured patterns in them. Coloured cotton is imported from India and weaved into detailed patterns using only a few colours. This fabric is also used for a type of blouse called "Dhaka ko cholo", meaning a "blouse made of dhaka cloth", and shawls for women. Some farmers and weavers have tried making silk Dhaka topi cloth with little success.

There are different myths about the origin of Dhaka fabric. One story tells that a minister returned from Dhaka, Bangladesh with the idea of such a topi. It then ended up replacing the old black cap in popularity. Another story tells that name is so because at first cloths and threads for Dhaka topi used to come from Dhaka, similar to Dhakai muslin (fine cotton of Dhaka). It is also possible that Hindu weavers started living in Nepal to run away from the Muslim invasion of Bengal. The method of pattern weaving used around Dhaka is called "Jamdani". It is very different from what is currently used by Nepalese weavers. A few fragments of Dhaka fabric in the collection of the National Museum of Nepal are thought to be from the early 20th century.

The most popular legend comes from the introduction of Dhaka weaving to Ganesh Man Maharjan, who worked in an Jamdani factory in 1950s. He was inspired to learn it when he noticed Dambar Kumari, Junga Bahadur Rana's daughter, wearing Dhaka clothes she brought back from Benares. Upon returning to his home Palpa his wife and he started a factory to produce Dhaka cloth in 1957. They had one spool and one hand-operated Charkha spinning wheel bought from Kathmandu and local weavers trained by Mahajan. His business did well because of the high price of better quality imports. As the Shah dynasty government showed a liking for Dhaka cloth and topis made out of it, other weavers started following Maharajan. By early 1970, his own factory Swadeshi Vastrakala Palpali Dhaka Udhyog had grown to employ around 350 workers. At that time Jaishanker Textile Industry, Khanal Textile Industry, and Nabin Textile Industry were the major producers of cotton yarn used to make Dhaka cloth.

Even though the business was good and the government was supportive, most weavers were poor. An expert weaver worked 12–16 hours a day for a month to produce 4–5 metres of Dhaka cloth. But, their wage was just 10-30 Nepalese rupees, one egg and 250 grams of Jeri. In the 1970s, the Dhaka weaving industry in Palpa changed a lot as it was introduced to Jacquard loom and easily available shiny acrylic fiber. Jacquard looms made it possible to produce several metres a day, instead of around 9-inches on a hand-loom. Many weavers lost their jobs because of this. Dhaka caps lost some of the qualities in its patterns, and the cloth started being produced in other places.

Now weavers in the capital Kathmandu, Palpa District in the middle mountains area, and Tehrathum District in the East are the main producers of Dhaka cloth. Limbus and Rais from the middle mountains are famous for the Dhaka cloth they produce. Tansen, the most popular source of Dhaka topis, is town with Magar, Brahmin, Chhetris with Newars who came in the 19th century looking for wealth. Apart from the famous Dhaka clothes, Tensen is also known for its metal craft including Karuwa mugs, jars and other items. It is a custom to buy Palpali Dhaka clothes as souvenir while visiting the area. This includes shawls and thailo purses that has two pairs of strings that can be drawn to open and close the purse. A Dhaka topi industry has been established in Darjeeling by Indian Gorkhas.

The traditional outfit of Nepali men includes "Daura-Suruwal" (Nepalese shirt and trouser suit), "Patuka" (cloth worn around the waist instead of a belt), "ista coat" (the Nepalese half-jacket without sleeves) and a topi. For woman it's "Gunyou Cholo" (a dress like "ghagra"-"kurta") with no topi. Many communities wear their own traditional dresses. Like the Tamang women wear a different round hat. Some Buddhist Tamang women wear "Bakhus" which are ethnic to the Tibetan people.

Topis for Nepali man can be either black (called "bhaad-gaaule" or "kalo topi") or multicoloured (called "Dhaka" or "Nepali topi"). "Bhaad-gaaule topis" are similar to Dhaka topi but they are black in colour because they are not made from Dhaka. Before the Nepali government started promoting Dhaka topis, Bhaad-gaaule topis that were largely made in Bhaktapur were popular. They were commonly worn by Newaris. These kalo topis (blacks caps) were once popular among upper class people of Rana dynasty. These black caps are now becoming popular again, mainly among the youth. Milliners of Bhaktapur almost had to close their business once because of the popularity of Dhaka topi. However, now their business is doing well as they were making around 600 kalo topis a week by 2015.

Next Australian federal election

The next Australian federal election will be held some time in or before 2025 to elect members of the 48th Parliament of Australia. All 150 seats in the House of Representatives and likely 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate will be up for election.

At the previous election, the three-term incumbent centre-right Liberal-National Coalition government, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, was defeated by the centre-left Labor Party, led by Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese. Albanese became the new Prime Minister. Morrison resigned as Liberal leader and was replaced by Peter Dutton, who became Opposition Leader, while Barnaby Joyce lost the National Party leadership to David Littleproud in a leadership spill.

There will be a redistribution of the electoral divisions in three states before the election: New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. Even though Australia's population has grown, New South Wales and Victoria have too many seats over the quota, so they will both have one less seat each, while Western Australia will gain an extra seat, meaning the House of Representatives will have 150 seats instead of 151. The Northern Territory will also have a redistribution, but there will still be two seats in the Northern Territory.

Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory will not undergo a redistribution until after this election.

Mixed-member proportional representation

Mixed-member proportional representation (often referred to as "MMP") is an electoral system used in Germany and in many English-speaking countries. It is often thought of as a proportional representation system. In the United Kingdom, MMP is often referred to as the "additional member system" (or "AMS"). It is used to select the German Bundestag in Germany and is used in parliaments and other elections in various English-speaking countries.

MMP systems attempt to achieve both a proportional representation and a majority support, by asking voters to vote for a specific representative, and vote for a political party. Some of the representatives are elected from electoral lists drawn up by the respective parties. The number of representatives who are considered elected on the respective lists of the parties and are thus allowed to move into parliament is determined according to the proportion of votes that the parties were able to unite.

Another part of the representation is directly elected through constituencies in which candidates stand for election. For this purpose, the country is divided into a number of administrative divisions, in which usually only one candidate can be elected at a time. Whichever candidate was able to collect the most votes is elected. The Federal Republic of Germany was the first country in which such an electoral system was introduced in 1949, in the elections to the German Bundestag.

The light-vented bulbul has a large white patch covering the nape and the sides of its black head. It also sings sweetly with a "cha-ko-lee...cha-ko-lee..." sound. It has a white color from the back of its eyes to the back of its head.

In Hong Kong, the light-vented bulbul is common in lightly wooded areas, farmland and shrubland, whereas the red-whiskered bulbul is the common bulbul of suburbs and town parks.

Sixty-five million years ago, a dinosaur-like alien named Keeper was pursued through the galaxy by Sledge, an intergalactic bounty hunter bent on acquiring ten magical stones called the Energems in Keeper's care and using them to conquer the universe. Keeper crash landed on prehistoric Earth, entrusting the gems to many dinosaurs for safe-keeping and crippled Sledge's ship with a bomb that left the bounty hunter stranded in deep space. Unfortunately, Sledge's collection of asteroids held in a tractor beam accidentally rained down on prehistoric Earth and ultimately caused the extinction of dinosaurs.

In the present day, Keeper is found by archaeologist Kendall Morgan and they set up a base under the Amber Beach Dinosaur Museum in the city Amber Beach. They begin a mission to find the Energems, but five have already been found by teenagers, who use them to morph into the Dino Charge Power Rangers. The group consists of the Red Ranger, Tyler
Navarro, the adventurous leader of the group who is searching for his father who disappeared ten years ago on an archaeological dig; the Pink Ranger, Shelby Watkins, a
waitress with a vast knowledge dinosaurs; the Blue Ranger, Koda, a cave man living in modern times as he found his Energem in his tribe's cave, and was kept in animation until the present day; the Green Ranger, Riley Griffin, the youngest of the group who is a skilled fencing swordman; and the Black Ranger, Chase Randall, the suave aid laid-back New Zealander. With these powers, the Dino Charge Power Rangers fight against Sledge, Poisandra, Fury, Wrench, Curio, and their prison full of monsters in order to find the remaining Energems and protect Earth.

As time goes by, the Rangers are joined by additional teammates with additional Dino Zords: the Gold Ranger, Sir Ivan, an eight-hundred-year-old knight from Zandar who was
trapped in the body of Sledge's minion Fury and the Graphite Ranger Prince Phillip III of Zandar, the modern day crown prince of Ivan's home country. Kendall takes over the
position of the Purple Ranger from Albert Smith who abandons the position due to his fears of Fury's minions. New threats also merge, including the human-like villain, Heckyl.

The Ranger team gets two new members: the Aqua Ranger, who is revealed to be Tyler's long lost father James and the Silver Ranger, who is revealed to be Zenowing, a follower and
apprentice of Keeper. However, with new powers come new enemies in the form of Singe, a mysterious warrior who arrives on Earth and quickly steps in as Heckyl's number two, much
to Fury's anger. However, Heckyl starts to get curious when he realizes that Singe knows more about the Energems than he admits. After the Rangers discover the location of the
Titano Zord, Heckyl demands to know how Singe knew its location, only for Singe to flee and return to Earth with the person who hired him named Lord Arcanon, who holds the evil
Dark Energem. It was Lord Arcanon who hired Sledge to bring him the galaxy's most dangerous monsters to make an army out of them. Arcanon's reign ends with the return of Sledge
who destroys his former employer with Snide (who was split from Heckyl) before Sledge betrays him and let the Rangers destroyed Snide too and takes back leadership of his crew.
At that time, Heckyl regains all of his memories as a good person, which he lost from the Dark Energem. The Rangers went back in time and destroyed Sledge and his crew in the
past.

After their enemies' destruction, the Rangers go their separate ways of Koda and Ivan finally go back to their own times, Heckyl becomes the guardian of the Dark Energem as he
and Zenowing return to Sentai 6, and Keeper returns to his home planet. The present day Rangers arrive back to their own time and find that it is a zoo and there are live
dinosaurs since Sledge's asteroids never hit Earth and the extinction of the dinosaurs never came to pass.

Britney Spears conservatorship dispute

The American pop singer Britney Spears was put in conservatorship in February 2008. The conservator was her father. Spears' conservatorship was from two 5150 psychiatric hospital admissions one month earlier that same year. She wanted the restrictions removed because she wasn't allowed to have further kids. She couldn't even marry or remove her pregnancy stopping device.

Spears later testified that she was subjected to seven days per week constant stage work by her father and several others. The conservatorship rules forbade when she went off schedule. Britney had to also take lithium (normally given to those diagnosed with bipolar disorders). She compared the seven days per week schedule toward sex trafficking.

The conservatorship was a short restriction at the start for Spears. It was later made permanent by her father and others. Spears spent three months shy of fourteen years in probate conservatorship limits (one for her finances, another for her own wellness and her health). Los Angeles County's Judge Brenda Penny dissolved the Spears conservatorship limits on November 12, 2021.

Several celebrities were also happy the restrictions ended. They include Cher, Paris Hilton, Lady Gaga, Mia Farrow, Missy Elliott and Cyndi Lauper. Others supporting the restrictions' end were Spears' mother, her lawyer and Free Britney movements' members and Spears' fans. Many of these people said Spears had been objectified when the conservatorship was effective.

Alfred Barye

Alfred Barye "Le Fils" or Alf Barye (Paris, France, 21 January 1839 – Paris, France, 1882) was a French sculptor of the Belle Époque. He was a student of his father, the artist Antoine-Louis Barye. In cooperation with Émile-Coriolan Guillemin, Barye did the artwork for ""The Arab Warrior Knight on Horseback"". Other works of his were animal bronzes as well as Oriental subjects. At his father's request, he signed his work as "fils" to differentiate his work from his father's.

As was his father Antoine Louis, Alfred Barye became Ferdinand Philippe d'Orléans' favorite sculptor, and later the quasi-official sculptor of Napoleon III.

He signed many of his sculptural works Barye or A. Barye, the same signature that was used by his father. This causes as much confusion today as it did during his lifetime and many of Alfred’s models are mistakenly attributed to and sold as his father’s works. After much family disagreement and at the insistence of his father, he began signing his work Alf. Barye, and later A. Barye Fils. It has been suggested but never confirmed that Alfred Barye was responsible for quite a few unauthorized life time casts of his father’s works. Many of the works mistakenly attributed to Antoine Louis Barye are actually by the brilliant son Alfred Barye. The young Alfred worked for a long time in his father's studio and while he conceived and created the works himself, his father appropriated them by signing them with the name Antoine Louis Barye and preventing his son from making his works with the Barye signature. Growing up Alfred began to rebel more and more of the violence of Antoine Louis Barye. Father and son did not speak to each other for several years. The Barye rebellion finds a symbolic moment in the sharing of artistic researches with another son of art Emile Guillemin with whom he formed a strong friendship and recipient esteem.

Barye's bronzes are now in many museums' collections:


Alfred Barye did several exhibitions in Paris from 1864 to 1882.

2013 UEFA European Under-19 Championship

The 2013 UEFA European Under-19 Championship was the 12th edition of the UEFA European Under-19 Championship, since its C from an under-18 tournament in 2002, and the 62nd since the tournament was created in 1948. It was hosted in Lithuania from 20 July to 1 August 2013, in three cities. Only players born after 1 January 1994 were available to participate.

The qualification matches began in September 2012 and ended in June 2013, with seven teams joining the Lithuanian hosts in the final tournament. Spain were the two-time defending champions, after defeating Greece in the final of the previous edition, but were eliminated and defeated by France in the semi-finals. In the final, France were beaten 1–0 by Serbia.

The final round matches were held in three stadium venues located in three Lithuanian cities:

Qualification for the final tournament occurred in two phases: a qualifying round and an elite round. During these rounds, 51 national teams competed to determine the seven teams that would join the automatically qualified host nation, Lithuania.

The qualifying round was played between 26 September and 26 November 2012, following a draw that took place on 29 November 2011 at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. According to the UEFA under-19 national team coefficient ranking, the top three teams – Spain, Serbia and Turkey – were given a bye to the elite round, whereas the remaining 48 teams were divided into two pots and drawn into 12 groups of four teams. Each group included two teams from both pots and was contested as a round-robin tournament, hosted in the country of one of the teams. The group winners and runners-up, along with the best third-placed team, qualified for the next round.

The elite round was played between 22 May and 11 June 2012 and was contested by the 25 teams advancing from the qualifying round plus the three teams which received byes. The draw took place on 5 December 2012 at the UEFA headquarters and allocated the 28 teams – previously arranged into four seeding pots according to their qualifying round coefficient (teams with bye were automatically seeded in the first pot) – into seven groups of four. Each group was contested similarly to the qualifying round, with the seven group winners securing qualification for the final tournament.

The following eight teams qualified for the final tournament:

UEFA named six referees and eight assistant referees to officiate matches at the final tournament. Additionally, two referees from the host nation were chosen as fourth officials.


The draw for the group stage was held on 14 June 2013 in Kaunas, at the Town Hall, and was run by the UEFA Youth and Amateur Football Committee chairman, Jim Boyce, who was assisted by final tournament ambassadors Vaida Česnauskienė and Marius Stankevičius. The eight finalists were drawn into two groups of four teams and played matches against each other in a round-robin system. The top two teams from each group advanced to the semi-finals.

If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria are applied:

If two teams are tied after having met in the last round of the group stage, their final ranking is determined instead by a penalty shoot-out. This method is only valid when determining which team qualifies for the next round or for another competition.

All times are in Eastern European Summer Time ().

Dora the Explorer: Super Star Adventures

Dora the Explorer: Super Star Adventures is an adventure video game for the Game Boy Advance released in 2004. It was developed by Imaginengine and published by Global Star. The game is designed for preschoolers ages 3–6 and is based on the Nick Jr. franchise, "Dora the Explorer".

The game is unique in that it uses pictures and symbols to communicate rather than words. The object of the game is to capture one of the six explorer stars. Each explorer star has a special power such as the ability to be noisy or the ability to create music. In order to capture the star, the player must complete a hide-and-seek activity. These activities include maze navigation, matching games, side-scrolling race games, a "Frogger"-type game, a complete-the-pattern activity and a song playing game.

The game was met with mainly negative reception from critics. "Electronic Gaming Monthly"'s reviewer Seanbaby stated, "[...] this game is for idiots. I don't care if they're four; if they play this, they're idiots."
