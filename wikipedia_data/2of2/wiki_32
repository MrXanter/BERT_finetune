Annie's Song

"Annie's Song" is a song recorded and written by singer/songwriter John Denver. It was his second number one song in the USA, staying that place for two weeks in July 1974. It also went to number one in the UK. 

"Annie's Song" was written as an poem to Denver's then-wife, Annie Denver (Annie Martel) of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota.

This song was written in about ten-and-a-half minutes one day on a ski lift to the top of Aspen Mountain in Aspen, Colorado, as the physical exhilaration of having "just skied down a very difficult run" and the feeling of total immersion in the beauty of the colours and sounds that filled all senses ..by the time he had finished the 10 minute ride, the song was finished. He went straight home and penned the song. 

The song has since become a wedding standard and an expression of love for many people, due to its grand imagery and the fact it could appeal anyone (Annie is not mentioned by name in any part of the song).

2020 Beirut explosion

On 4 August 2020, an explosion happened in the city of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon.

The blast happened at the Port of Beirut and left at least 220 people dead (with the total expected to go higher), at least 7,500 injured, and many more missing. The Governor of Beirut, Marwan Abboud, said over 300,000 people lost their homes.

It is said that the explosion may have been caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate. Ammonium nitrate is a chemical substance that can be used for fertilizer. It can also be used to make explosives. The government took the ammonium nitrate from a ship in the port of Damascus, the MV Rhosus. The MV Rhosus had been abandoned in the port, after the Lebanese government said it was no longer fit to travel by sea. The ammonium nitrate was then stored in the port, for at least six years. This may have been without the proper precautions. There are various regulations how ammonium nitrate should be stored, and handled. In its pure form, ammonium nitrate does not burn; but it increases fires a great deal. It should therefore not be stored near flammable substances, and it should not be heated in a closed space. It is also very sensitive to temperature.

Before the big explosion, here seems to have been a fire in a part of the warehouse, where fireworks were stored. The ammonium nitrate was stored in the same building.

The explosion has been compared to three thousand tonnes of TNT.

Some countries offered medical aid, rescue teams and money to help deal with the aftermath of the disaster.

Orichalcum

Orichalcum or aurichalcum, ὀρείχαλκος is the name of a metal or two different metals. Old writings from ancient Greece talk about orichalcum and the Romans made coins out of a metal they called orichalcum, but they might not have been the same metal. People were not sure exactly what it was, until 2015 a shipwreck was found whose cargo contained ingots of orichalcum. 

Initially some scholars thought orichalcum was the ancient Greek name for platinum. Others thought it was an alloy, or mixture, of copper and either gold, tin, or zinc. Scientists examined Roman coins and found a mixture of copper and zinc.

The chemical analysis of the ingots found in the 2015 shipwreck revealed orichalcum is high quality brass. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, and while the ancient Greeks did not know metallic zinc, they knew zinc-containing ores, and the description that orichalcum has similar colour and shine as gold, fits well to the properties of brass. While brass is not exactly a precious metal, it does not corrode and it is widely used on jewelry, marine instruments and medical instruments. Goldsmiths and jewellers describe brass as "mahogany of metals".

The name "orichalcum" is from the Greek word for "mountain copper" or "mountain metal."

Some people think name "aurichalcum" comes from the word "aurum" for "gold," but it does not.

In general, when ancient Greek writers wrote about orichalcum, they said it was a metal that looked like gold but that they did not know much else about it. To Homer, Hesiod and Plato, orichalcum was a metal from much earlier times that did not exist in their own time and place.

In one of the Homeric Hymns, Homer writes about orichalcum earrings. He says the goddess Aphrodite wears them. Hesiod writes about orichalcum greaves, which are leg armor. Neither writer was talking about his own time and place.

Plato wrote about orichalcum in his book "Critias". In the book, Plato says orichalchum was in the ground of the legendary island of Atlantis. To the Atlanteans, it was the second-most-valuable metal, after gold. Plato says the Atlanteans put orichalcum on their city walls and temples. Plato calls orichalcum "only a name" in his own time, meaning he did not think he had ever seen orichalcum.

The ancient Romans also had a metal that they called orichalcum. Around the time the Roman Republic ended and the Roman Empire started, the Romans stopped making coins out of bronze and started making them out of orichalcum: asses coins, sestertii coins, dupondii coins and semisses coins.

Roman orichalcum does corrode over time, the way iron rusts and silver tarnishes.

Scientists analyzed Roman coins and saw they were made of copper and zinc. During the early days of the Roman Empire, Romans invented a better way to make zinc-copper alloys. This way is called cementation. To do it, the metalworker has to heat the zinc and copper to exactly the correct temperature. Then there can be as much as 30% zinc in the orichalcum.

Orichalcum appears in many works of fiction, especially stories about Atlantis. It is in television shows, for example "The Mysterious Cities of Gold" and "". It is in video games, for example "Castlevania: Curse of Darkness" and "Elder Scrolls" and also

Overeating

Overeating (or over-eating) is eating food more than the body needs. There is a relationship between the energy that an organism uses and the amount eaten. Eating more leads to weight gaining and often obesity. It may be regarded as an eating disorder.

One consequence of overeating is weight gain, and excess weight may cause blood pressure to rise. In turn this makes illness and even death more likely.

The problem is very difficult to reverse: losing weight is often attempted, but rarely succeeds. Weight lost is usually rapidly replaced. Diets are famously unsuccessful. Obesity is the end product of overeating.

Some difficult facts are known. Poorer families tend to eat worse food than better-off families. Children learn from the experiences in their families. Once established, habits are hard to break. In 2013, several medical societies, including the American Medical Association and the American Heart Association, classified obesity as a disease.

Cassegrain telescope

Cassegrain telescopes are reflector telescopes that use two curved mirrors to make an image. The big primary mirror gathers and concentrates light. The small secondary mirror then reflects the light through the back of the mirror. The secondary mirror is also curved so that it the light path is longer than the tube.

A "true Cassegrain" uses a primary mirror with a parabola-shaped curve, and a secondary mirror with a hyperbola-shaped curve. This is hard to make. Sphere-shaped curves are easier to make, but the image would be blurry. Catadioptric (lens and mirror) telescopes fix this by putting a special lens in front of the telescope.

Cassegrains are useful both as amateur telescopes which normal people can buy, and for scientists for serious astronomy work.

Lots of telescopes which are similar to cassegrains have been invented. Here are a few.

Gregorian telescope

A Gregorian telescope was the first telescope to be designed that uses mirrors instead of lenses. It was invented by the English astronomer John Gregory. Even though it was designed in 1663, it wasn't the first reflecting telescope to be built. Newton's telescope, a different design, was built in 1668. The Gregorian telescope was first built in 1673 by Robert Hooke.

The telescope uses two curved mirrors. The large primary gathers light, and the small secondary reflects the light out the back of the primary mirror. Both mirrors are concave (bowl-shaped).

It is very similar to the Cassegrain telescope, which uses a large concave primary mirror and a small convex secondary mirror.

Herschelian telescope

A Herschelian telescope was invented in the 1780s by William Herschel. It is similar to a Newtonian telescope, except using only one mirror. 

In the 1780s, telescopes used metal mirrors which were not very reflective. Each mirror would absorb light and make the image dimmer. So Herschel invented a telescope with a tilted mirror that put the eyepiece in the front.

When mirrors became more reflective, Herschelian telescopes stopped being useful.

Shooting of Leonard Deadwyler

Leonard Deadwyler (February 19, 1941 – May 7, 1966) was an African-American man who was shot and killed by LAPD officer Jerold M. Bova after allegedly speeding and running red lights while driving his wife, who was in labor, to the hospital. His wife later sued Los Angeles for wrongful death, and was represented by Johnnie Cochran, but lost the case. However, Deadwyler's death inspired the building of Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital in South Central.

Deadwyler was born on February 19, 1941 in Gainesville, Georgia. He was the oldest of three children. He met his wife Barbara (nee, Buffington) in Kindergarten and they married in 1960. Shortly after, they moved to Kansas then Chattanooga, Tennessee and finally, Los Angeles. The Deadwylers had two children together. At the time of his death, Barbara Deadwyler was pregnant with their youngest son, Michael.

Barbara Deadwyler, Leonard's wife was 8 months pregnant and began experiencing what she believed to be labor pains. Deadwyler tied a white handkerchief to the car's antenna, to signify an emergency, a common sign in Georgia, where the couple had moved from a year earlier. While driving, Deadwyler ran through several red lights while speeding, causing a police chase that began at 108th St. and Avalon Blvd., which he mistook as a police escort. Bova eventually pulled the car over at 60th St. and Avalon, where he approached Deadwyler with his gun drawn and leaned into the car. Bova testified that the car lurched forward, causing his gun to go off and shoot Deadwyler at point blank range. Deadwyler's wife stated that no such movement had taken place and that Bova "shot him for no reason."

During testimony, the State proffered that Deadwyler had a .35 blood-alcohol level and was drunk. His widow refuted this, as he had not been drinking and an alcohol level that high would make it very difficult for an individual to function and drive safely at a high speed. Bova testified that the car had lurched forward while the defense argued that it would be near impossible as the car had been parked behind another vehicle.

On May 31st, 1966 a coroner's jury ruled Deadwyler's death an accidental homicide, with one juror calling it an "excusable homicide." The jury, who deliberated for two hours and thirty-five minutes consisted of eight men and one female. Only one member of the jury was black.

At the time, it was the longest inquest over the death of a single individual in the Los Angeles County Coroner's office lasting eight days with testimony from 49 witnesses and 87 exhibits and the first televised inquest in California.

He then moved to Los Angeles, where he graduated from Moler Barber College and became a security guard for the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department. Four years later, in 1950, he attended the California School of Photography and Graphic Design and the Fred Archer School of Photography where he earned the nickname "One Shot Harry" for his quick work.

He later resigned from the Sheriff's Department to open a barbershop and studio at 4223 Avalon Blvd., which he would move to 4300 South Central in 1971.

The Los Angeles Times said that "His photographs captured everyday life in the city’s African American community. His work also includes images of dignitaries such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, a young Tom Bradley, former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and many others."

Binary neural network

Binary neural network is an artificial neural network, where commonly used floating-point weights are replaced with binary ones. 

It saves storage and computation, and serves as a technique for deep models on resource-limited devices. Using binary values can bring up to 58 times speedup. Accuracy and information capacity of binary neural network can be manually controlled. Binary neural networks do not achieve the same accuracy as their full-precision counterparts, but improvements are being made to close this gap.

It has been argued theoretically that quantum computers could train binary neural nets to their global optimum via quantum search techniques in shorter time than brute force classical optimisation.

Lenticel

A lenticel is porous tissue in the bark of trees. Its cells make large intercellular spaces in the periderm of the bark. They are found in the woody stems and roots of dicotyledonous flowering plants. 

Lenticels are also found in other woody plants, starting in the Carboniferous period. The development and increase in these primitive lenticels gave a system for aeration and gas exchange in these plants.

Lenticels work as pores for the direct exchange of gases. Otherwise the bark is impermeable to gases. The name 'lenticel' comes from its lenticular (lens-like) shape. The shape of lenticels is one of the characteristics used for tree identification.

Durham Castle

Durham Castle is a Norman castle in the city of Durham, England. It is the former residence of the Bishop of Durham. University College, Durham is there since 1837. 

Together with Durham Cathedral, the castle is a World Heritage Site in England since 1986. It is open to the general public to visit through guided tours.

The construction of the Castle began in 1072. It follows the usual Norman style. It was built by order of William the Conqueror about six years after the Norman conquest of England, and soon after the Normans first came to the North. The building took place under the supervision of Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria. Stone for the new buildings was cut from the cliffs below the walls and moved up using winches.

The Castle remained the bishop's palace for the Bishop of Durham until Auckland Castle became the bishops' residence in 1832. Durham Castle was donated to the University of Durham by Bishop William Van Mildert and later become the college. The college did not occupy the castle until 1837, renovations of the building was completed by the next Bishop, Edward Maltby.

The Norman Chapel is the oldest accessible part of the castle built in about 1078. Its architecture is Anglian in nature, possibly due to forced Anglian labour being used to build it. In the 15th century, its three windows were all but blocked up because of the expanded keep. It then fell into abandonment until 1841 when it was used as a corridor through which to access the keep. 

During the Second World War, it was used as a command and observation post for the Royal Air Force when its original use was recognised. 

The chapel was re-consecrated shortly after the war and is still used for weekly services by the college.

Tunstall's Chapel, named after Cuthbert Tunstall, was built in the 15th century and is used for worship within the college. It was modified in the 17th Century by Bishop Cosin. 


Studley Royal Park

Studley Royal Park (including the Ruins of Fountains Abbey) is a UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site in North Yorkshire, England. It has an area of 323 hectares (800 acres) and features an 18th-century landscaped garden, some of the largest Cistercian ruins in Europe, a Jacobean mansion, and a Victorian church designed by William Burges.

Fountains Abbey was founded in 1132 by Benedictine monks who left St Mary's Abbey, York to follow the Cistercian order. After the end of the monasteries in 1539 by Henry VIII, the Abbey buildings and over 500 acres (200 ha) of land were sold by the Crown to a merchant named Sir Richard Gresham. The property was passed down through several generations of Sir Gresham's family. Between 1598 and 1604, it was sold to Stephen Proctor, who built Fountains Hall. 

The hall is a Jacobean mansion, built partly with stone from the Abbey ruins. Fountains Abbey mill is the only 12th-century Cistercian cornmill left in the UK and the oldest 'intact' building on the estate.

From 1452 onwards, Studley Royal was inhabited by the Mallory family, most notably by MPs John Mallory and William Mallory. John Aislabie inherited the Studley estate from his elder brother in 1693. In 1966 the estate was bought by West Riding County Council and was taken over by the National Trust in 1983. 

Studley Royal House (or Hall) is in the north-west corner of the park. Originally a medieval manor house, it has a main block with forward projecting wings. It burned down in 1716 and was rebuilt by John Aislabie. The building was destroyed by fire in 1946. A large stable block, built between 1728 and 1732, survived and is now a private house ( 54° 7'30.55"N 1°34'34.82"W ).

In 1966, the estate was purchased by West Riding County Council and was acquired by the National Trust in 1983. The Abbey precinct is managed by English Heritage on behalf of the National Trust. 

In 1986 the entire Park was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is considered “a masterpiece of human creative genius", and" an outstanding example of a type of building or architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates significant stages in human history”.

Since 1994 the estate has been within the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria

Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria (died 31 May 1076) was the last Anglo-Saxon earl. He was the only English aristocrat to be executed during the reign of William I.

Waltheof was the second son of Siward, Earl of Northumbria. His mother was Aelfflaed, daughter of Ealdred, Earl of Bernicia, son of Uhtred, Earl of Northumbria. In 1054, Waltheof became the heir of his father's throne as his elder brother Osbearn was killed in battle. Siward died in 1055, and Waltheof being far too young to succeed as Earl of Northumbria, King Edward appointed Tostig Godwinson to the earldom.

When Sweyn II invaded Northern England in 1069, Waltheof and Edgar Aetheling joined the Danes and took part in the attack on York. He would again make a fresh submission to William after the departure of the invaders in 1070. He was restored to his earldom and went on to marry William's niece, Judith of Lens. In 1072, he was appointed Earl of Northampton.

Waltheof had many enemies in the north. Amongst them were members of a family who had killed Waltheof's maternal great-grandfather, Uchtred the Bold, and his grandfather Ealdred. This was part of a long-running blood feud. In 1074, Waltheof moved against the family by sending his retainers to ambush them and succeeded in killing the two eldest of four brothers in the family. 

In 1075 Waltheof joined the Revolt of the Earls against William I. His motives for taking part in the revolt are unclear, as is the depth of his involvement. However he repented, confessing his guilt first to Archbishop Lanfranc and then in person to William I, who was at the time in Normandy. He returned to England with William but was arrested, brought twice before the king's court and sentenced to death.

In 1092, after a fire in the chapter house, the abbot had Waltheof's body moved to a prominent place in the abbey church. When the coffin was opened, it is reported that the corpse was found to be intact with the severed head re-joined to the trunk. This was regarded as a miracle, and the abbey began to publicise it. As a result, pilgrims began to visit Waltheof's tomb. He was celebrated on 31 August.

Due to the beliefs in the miracle, Waltheof became the subject of popular media. His heroic yet often inaccurate accounts were preserved in the "Vita et Passio Waldevi comitis", a Middle English "Waltheof saga," and the Anglo-Norman "Waldef".

In 1070 Waltheof married Judith de Lens, daughter of Lambert II, Count of Lens and Adelaide of Normandy, Countess of Aumale. They had three children, the eldest of whom, Maud, brought the earldom of Huntingdon to her second husband, David I of Scotland, and another, Adelise (Alice of Nothumbria) married the Anglo-Norman noble Raoul III of Tosny.

One of Waltheof's grandsons was Waltheof (died 1159), abbot of Melrose.

Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd

The Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd is a World Heritage Site recognised by UNESCO. It is located in Gwynedd, Wales. The site includes the castles of Beaumaris and Harlech. It also includes the castles and town walls of Caernarfon and Conwy. It is considered to be the "finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe".

It is described as the "zenith of English castle-building" by D. J. Cathcart King. It is because of the use of concentric defences, barbicans, and substantial gatehouses. Also, Sidney Toy considers them as "some of the most powerful castles of any age or country". Historians such as Michael Prestwich and Abigail Wheatley both appreciate its roles as palaces and symbols of royal power.

The location of the castles in Caernarfon and Conwy were chosen for their political significance and their military uses. The castles include luxury apartments and gardens. Caernarfon's castle and town walls had expensive stonework. They were perhaps made to suggest images of Arthurian or Roman imperial power. They are believed to have been made to improve Edward's personal prestige. 

The exact role of the royal architect James of St George in the construction is still being argued by many academics. The same with the influence of his native county of Savoy on the designs. However, the main sources indicate that he played a key role in its construction. They even described him as: “Magistro Jacobo de sancto Georgio, Magistro operacionum Regis in Wallia”. It means “Master James of Saint George, Master of the King’s Works in Wales.”
In 1986 the sites were announced as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Together, they were called the "Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd". 

UNESCO considered the sites to be the "finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe". UNESCO also brings up the importance of their links to Edward I and James of St George, their scale and advanced military architecture, and their unusually good condition and historical documentation. 

The estimated costs to maintain the sites was around £239,500 during 2002–03. "Buffer zones" have been established around the sites. They are aimed to protect the views and setting from inappropriate development or harm. The sites are protected by a mixture of UK Scheduled Monument, Listed Building and conservation area legislation.

Fountains Abbey

Fountains Abbey is one of the largest and best preserved ruined Cistercian monasteries in England. It is sits approximately south-west of Ripon in North Yorkshire. It was founded in 1132 and operated for 407 years. It one of the wealthiest monasteries in England until it was dissolved in 1539, under the order of Henry VIII.

It is a Grade I listed building owned by the National Trust. It is part of the designated Studley Royal Park including the Ruins of Fountains Abbey. It is one of the recognised World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

After a riot in 1132 at the Benedictine abbey of St Mary's in York, 13 monks were expelled. Among them was Saint Robert of Newminster. They were taken under the protection of Thurstan, Archbishop of York. He provided them with land in the valley of the River Skell, which is a tributary of the Ure. The enclosed valley had all the natural features needed for the creation of a monastery. It provided shelter from the weather as well as stone and timber for building. It also had a good supply of running water. 

After a harsh winter in 1133, the monks applied to join the Cistercian order. At that time, it was a fast-growing reform movement. By the beginning of the 13th century, it had over 500 houses. In 1135, Fountains became the second Cistercian house in northern England, just after Rievaulx. 

The Fountains monks were under Clairvaux Abbey, in Burgundy. It was under the rule of St Bernard. Under the guidance of Geoffrey of Ainai, a monk sent in from Clairvaux, the group learned how to celebrate the seven Canonical Hours. According to Cistercian usage, they were shown how to construct wooden buildings in accordance with Cistercian architecture.

The abbey precinct covers and is surrounded by an wall. The wall was built in the 13th century. Some parts of it are visible to the south and west of the abbey. 

The precinct can be divided into different groups of buildings. The central group is the abbey church, the cloister, and the buildings round the cloister. This was where the monks lived, prayed, ate, slept, and worked. The "inner court" has other buildings for the daily life of the abbey. These are buildings such as the infirmary, the abbot's house, and guest houses for visitors. The infirmary was a place where monks could stay when they were ill.
The "outer court" had buildings for farming and industry, such as the watermill and the wool house. Over the years Fountains Abbey became very rich, mostly by selling wool. 

The original abbey church was built of wood and "was probably" two stories high. It was, however, quickly replaced with stone. The church was damaged in the attack on the abbey in 1146 and was rebuilt as a larger church on the same site. Building work was completed c.1170. This second church was completed around 1170. It was long , made up of 11 bays. The infirmary (marked "Abbots House" on the plan) had one of the largest halls in England in the middle ages , It had its own chapel and kitchens. Parts of it are on top of tunnels where the River Skell flows.
The archaeological excavation of the site began under the supervision of John Richard Walbran. In 1846, he published a paper "On the Necessity of clearing out the Conventual Church of Fountains". In 1966, the Abbey was placed in the guardianship of the Department of the Environment and the estate. It was purchased by the West Riding County Council, which later transferred its ownership to the North Yorkshire County Council in 1974. 

The National Trust bought the Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal estate from North Yorkshire County Council in 1983. In 1986 the parkland in where the abbey stands was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. 

It was recognised for fulfilling the criteria of ""being a masterpiece of human creative genius"." It was described ""as an outstanding example of a type of building or architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates significant stages in human history"." 

Fountains Abbey is owned by the National Trust and maintained by English Heritage. The trust owns Studley Royal Park, Fountains Hall, St Mary's Church, which was designed by William Burges and built around 1873. All of them are significant features of the World Heritage Site.

In January 2010, Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal became two of the first National Trust properties to be included in Google Street View, using the Google Trike.

Fountains Abbey was used as a film location by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark for their single "Maid of Orleans (The Waltz Joan of Arc)" during the cold winter of December 1981. In 1980, Hollywood filmed its final scenes to the film "". Other productions set on location of the abbey include: "Life at the Top", "The Secret Garden", "The History Boys." Television series such as "Flambards", "A History of Britain", "Terry Jones' Medieval Lives", "Cathedral", "Antiques Roadshow." Several game shows such as "Treasure Hunt" The BBC Television series "Gunpowder" (2017) also used Fountains Abbey as a location.

Fountains Abbey was featured twice in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Books. It includes poetical illustrations by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. 



Hurricane Isaac

The name Isaac has been used for five tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean.


Pontcysyllte Aqueduct

The Pontcysyllte Aqueduct () is a canal aqueduct in north east Wales. It took 10 years to design and build. It was completed in 1805. It is the longest aqueduct in Great Britain, and is the highest canal aqueduct in the world. The 18-arched stone and cast iron structure is designed for narrowboats.

The aqueduct was part of a grand plan which was never completed. It was part of the proposed Ellesmere Canal. It would have been an industrial waterway which made a link between the River Severn at Shrewsbury and the port of Liverpool on the River Mersey. 

The westerly high-ground route across the Vale of Llangollen was chosen. A less expensive route was surveyed to the east, but the route chosen would have taken the canal through a mineral-rich area. It would have taken the canal through the coalfields of North-East Wales. However, only parts of the canal route were completed. The plan fell through because the money ran out. The capitalist system at the time was primitive and unreliable. Most major work on the canal stopped after the completion of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in 1805.

The structure is a Grade I listed building. It is recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The name "Pontcysyllte" is Welsh for "Cysyllte Bridge", or "Bridge of Cysyllte". Cysyllte is the township of the old parish of Llangollen, where the southern end of the bridge lies. 

In 1999, the aqueduct and its surrounding lands were submitted to the "tentative list" of properties being considered for UNESCO World Heritage Site status. The aqueduct was suggested as a contender in 2005, its 200th anniversary year. It was finally announced in 2006 that a larger proposal, which covers a section of the canal from the aqueduct to Horseshoe Falls would be the United Kingdom's 2008 nomination.

Parts of the site including the length of canal from Rhoswiel, Shropshire, to the Horseshoe Falls, Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, and Chirk Aqueduct were visited by inspectors from UNESCO in October 2008. It was carried out to analyse and confirm the site management and authenticity. The aqueduct was named by UNESCO on the World Heritage List on 27 June 2009.



2020 Belarusian presidential election

The Presidential elections were held in Belarus on 9 August 2020. 

These candidates appeared on the ballot:


It was announced that Lukashenko won the election, marking his 6th term as President of the Republic of Belarus. This was disputed by both national and international sources. The platform "Golos (voice)" created prior to the election allowed Belarusians to upload photographs of their voting papers. From the sample provided – over 1 million voters – it was proven impossible for former President Lukashenko to obtain the number of votes stated. 


Opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya declared herself as the national leader of the country and called on Lukashenko to start negotiations. Meanwhile, her campaign team stated that they were ready to hold "long-term protests" against the official results.

Many protested the election results. Some governments did not recognise the results.

Blaenavon

Blaenavon () is a town in southeastern Wales. It is on the south of Afon Lwyd and north of Pontypool. Parts of the town and surrounding country form the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape became part of the World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000. There are about 6,057 people living there.

Blaenavon is a community represented by Blaenavon Town Council, and electoral ward of Torfaen County Borough Council. Blaenavon is often

twinned with Coutras in France.

The town is near the source of the Afon Lwyd river. It is in the north of Cwmbran.

Parts of the town and surrounding country form the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape were recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000. Some of the attractions in the town include: 


After Samuel Hopkins death in 1815, his sister Sarah Hopkins of Rugeley, erected Blaenavon Endowed School in his memory.

St Peter's Church was constructed in 1804. It was gifted to the parish by Thomas Hill and Samuel Hopkins.

It had a Blaenavon Golf Club which was founded in 1906. The club closed in 1937.

Some of the most notable people from Blaenavon are:

Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway

Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway (born 21 January 2004) is the elder child of Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit. She is second in line to succeed her grandfather King Harald V. She is a member of the House of Glücksburg; and she is expected to become the country's second female monarch, after the 15th-century Queen Margaret.

Princess Ingrid Alexandra was born on 21 January 2004 at 9:13 am in The National Hospital, part of the Oslo University Hospital in Oslo. She is the first child and only daughter of Crown Prince Haakon, heir apparent to the throne, and the second granddaughter of King Harald V and Queen Sonja. Her mother, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has a son named Marius Borg Høiby, born in 1997 from a previous relationship.

Ingrid Alexandra was baptised by Bishop Gunnar Stålsett in the chapel of the Royal Palace on 17 April 2004. Her godparents were her grandfather the King, her aunt Princess Märtha Louise, the Crown Prince of Denmark, the Crown Princess of Sweden, the then Prince of Asturias, and her maternal grandmother, Marit Tjessem.

On 31 August 2019, Ingrid Alexandra was confirmed in the Palace Chapel in Oslo.

Ingrid Alexandra started her first day of school on 19 August 2010 at Jansløkka elementary school, a local state school attended by her half-brother. School officials hoped to make the school a place where the princess could make friends and enjoy some relief from public scrutiny.

On 17 June 2014, the Norwegian Royal Family announced that from the start of the 2014–2015 school year, Princess Ingrid Alexandra would move to the private English-language Oslo International School, reportedly because her parents wanted her to be fluent in English.

Princess Ingrid Alexandra was transferred to Oslo's Uranienborg School to complete her lower secondary education. In the fall of 2020, she is scheduled to start at Elvebakken Upper Secondary School in Oslo.

Francisco A. Cárdenas

Francisco Atenógenes Cárdenas Garza (born on July 16, 1879 in Abasolo, Nuevo León - died: July 3, 1943 in San Antonio, Texas) was a Mexican engineer and politician. He was Governor of Nuevo León. He later resigned before the end of his term. 

Francisco A. Cárdenas was born in Abasolo, Nuevo León, on July 16, 1879. His parents are José Dolores Cárdenas and Virginia Garza. He studied at the old Monterrey Civil College. He then graduated mining engineer from St. Mary's College in San Antonio, Texas. When he returned home, he dedicated himself to agriculture and livestock activities. His efforts got stopped by the outbreak of the revolutionary conflict in 1910.

Years later, Cárdenas began to show interest in politics. This led him to become mayor of his hometown. Later on, he became the deputy for the XLII Local Legislature. By September 16, 1929, he became second in command and reported to General Aarón Sáenz Garza.

In mid-1931, he was elected the governor for Nuevo León from October 4, 1931 to October 4, 1935. However, he didn't complete the term as he resigned on December 27, 1933.

Governor Cárdenas had to overcome many challenges caused by the world recession in 1929. Among the issues include the fall in state's income as this forced the president to order that the salaries of public servants be reduced. Many reforms were made to the finance laws which caused the property tax to increase in cities throughout the State. At the same time, taxes on salaries were created. Despite the economic difficulties, the industrial sector's growth did not slow down its growth. In fact, new factories were created.

Sensitive to the increasing demand for education at the professional level, he organized and led a general committee for the founding of the State University. The works began in February 1933. 

By May 31, the decree for founding University of Nuevo León was proclaimed. Its first headmaster was writer Héctor González.

He was also instrumental in the construction of the new Civil Hospital. Works began on May 3, 1933 on an area of about thirty hectares. He also setup the Central Board of Conciliation and Arbitration (1931); the founding of the Casa del Campesino (1932); the construction of the first highway from Nuevo Laredo to Monterrey, and the promulgation of a new General Law of Public Instruction.

Francisco A. Cárdenas resigned from his position on December 27, 1933. He led a private life after his retirement. He died in San Antonio, Texas, on July 3, 1943. His remains were buried in Panteón del Carmen, in Monterrey.


Quorn, Leicestershire

Quorn is a village in Leicestershire, a county in the East Midlands region of England. It is situated near to the university town of Loughborough. The village's population in 2011 was 5,177.

The village was named Quorndon until 1899. The name was shortened to Quorn to avoid confusion in posting as the name was similar to the village of Quarndon in nearby Derbyshire.

Quorn is built around the old A6 road, it runs through the centre of the village. On 28 October 1991, a dual carriageway bypass opened. The building of this road took the A6 away to the north-east of the village.

Quorn, the famous meat substitute company, takes its name from the village. It began production in 1985.

The village has a heritage railway station, Quorn and Woodhouse, on the Great Central Steam Railway, a preserved railway that runs between Loughborough and Leicester. The station also serves the hamlet of Woodhouse.

Gordon Banks, former England international football goalkeeper, lived in Quorn for many years of his life.

ParaHoxozoa

ParaHoxozoa is a proposed group within taxonomy. It would be a clade, above phylum but below a kingdom. 

It would include the Bilateria, the Placozoa and the Cnidarians.

Parahoxozoa is named after the groups of genes that scientists found in the organisms in it: (sub)classes (HNF, CUT, PROS, ZF, CERS, K50, S50-PRD) and Hox/ParaHox-ANTP. Some scientists said they thought a similar gene, ANTP, the NK gene, and the Cdx Parahox gene were also in sponges in the phylum Porifera, but for now, Parahoxozoa does not have sponges in it.
Scientists are not sure where to put Placozoa. They think it could be a sister clade to the other Parahoxozoa (the Planulozoa hypothesis) or sister of Cnidaria.

The first bilateral organisms (the first living things that were symmetrical from side to side) were worms which lived on the bottom of bodies of water. This type of worm probably had only one opening in its body instead of both a mouth and an anus, as bilateral organisms do today. A through-gut may already have developed with the ctenophora. The through-gut, the tubelike digestive system with two ends, may have evolved when the organism's one hole closed in the middle. For example, Acoela look like the planula larvae of some cnidarians.

Enskede gård

Enskede gård is a district in Söderort, Stockholm. It shares borders with Johanneshov, Gamla Enskede, Enskedefältet and Årsta. Its name came from the former manor and estate, Enskede farm. The farm was mentioned as early as 1392.

Local Bubble

The Local Bubble, or Local Cavity, is where we are in our galaxy. It is a relative cavity in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Orion Arm in the Milky Way. It contains among others, the Local Interstellar Cloud, which contains the Solar System, and the G-Cloud. It is at least 300 light years across. It has a neutral-hydrogen density of about 0.05 atoms/cm, or about one tenth of the average for the ISM in the Milky Way (0.5 atoms/cm)

The exceptionally sparse gas of the Local Bubble is the result of supernovae that exploded within the past ten to twenty million years. The gas is still in an excited state, emitting in the X-ray band.

Bælum

Bælum is a village in Denmark. It is 31 km from Aalborg. According to January 2020 census, there are 733 people living there. It is a part of Rebild Municipality.

It is 5 km northeast of Terndrup and 16 km north of Hadsund. There is a Bælum Church and Bælum Mill. There is a wind turbine and the motor house. They have been fully restored and are maintained by Bælum Møllelaug.

DNA barcoding

DNA barcoding is a form of genetic analysis. It is part of molecular biology. Scientists use DNA barcoding to tell different species apart from each other. Scientists use DNA barcoding to tell which species are related to each other or evolved from the same older species.

The first types of DNA sequencing started in the 1980s.

In DNA barcoding, the technician sequences part of a gene and compares it to that same gene in other species. Sometimes scientists use the short fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene as a DNA barcode gene. The fragment is usually 400 to 800 base pairs long.

Groups of scientists choose different genes to barcode depending on their project. A good barcode gene has to be short in length and have the exact same sequence at its beginning and end, but its middle has to be different enough in different species.

Some scientists say DNA barcoding is the opposite of genomics. DNA barcoding uses a few specific parts of the genome, and genomics is about looking at the entire genome.

DNA barcoding costs less money than other kinds of DNA sequencing. This means that smaller laboratories can afford to use it, and all laboratories can do more of it. It is also much easier to learn how to do than other forms of taxonomy. That means more people can learn to use it.

One good thing about DNA barcoding is that it helps human beings get around ideas that seem right but are really wrong. For example, some animals look similar even though they are not closely related. Some animals look different even though they are closely related. It is easy for a scientist to think two species are related because they look or act alike. For example, cows are more closely related to whales and orcas than they are to horses, even though cows walk on hooves, live on land, and eat grass like horses do. Looking at DNA barcoding makes it easier to see what really happened in evolution.

Another good thing about DNA barcoding is that scientists do not need to get close to the animal or plant they want to study. This is good for studying animals that are easily damaged, very shy, or dangerous to humans. The scientists do not even need to see the organism to use DNA barcoding. In one study, scientists collected feces (poop) from an African savanna. They used DNA barcoding to tell which species of animal had left it there and which plants it had eaten, all from the undigested DNA.

DNA barcoding makes it much much faster and easier to tell what a species eats. Before DNA barcoding, scientists had to follow an insect or other animal around and watch it eat. This could take many years. With DNA barcoding, scientists can look at what is in the animal's digestive system. This is fast enough that scientists can watch animals' eating habits change with climate change.

With DNA sequencing and DNA barcoding, scientists went into museums to look at specimens, or preserved example animals, that had been collected many years before. Using DNA sequencing, the scientists were able to tell that one butterfly collected in the 1700s was really ten different species of butterfly and not just one. Scientists made many discoveries of this kind in old museum collections.

Herpetologists (amphibian scientists) used DNA barcoding to analyze the parachuting frog in 2019. They found it by climbing mountains in Papua New Guinea.


Actinidia

Canadian Aboriginal syllabics

Canadian syllabic writing, or simply syllabics, is an abugida and brahmic script created by a Christian missionary to write down the languages of some of the First Nations of Canada. This one alphabet later became many alphabets.

Each letter represents a syllable. The letters look like triangles and curves. Different languages have some different letters to represent the sounds in their own language best.

By the late 19th century the Cree had achieved what may have been one of the highest literacy rates in the world.

James Evan was a Methodist missionary from England. He wanted to create an alphabet to teach the Cree and Ojibwe about Christianity. He got inspiration from the Devanagari alphabet from India.

Every consonant has the same shape. For example, the syllables that start with a "p" sound look like a V. To show that they have different vowels, the shapes are rotated. So "pe" would look like ᐯ whole "pa" would be ᐸ.

In some languages, words end in a final consonant, like the "t" in "cat." To show this, a small letter is added to the end of the word.

In some languages, diacritics are added to indicate things like vowel length.

Syllabics is one of the official writing systems of Nunavut. That means that government forms in Inuktitut can be written either in the Latin alphabet (ABCs) or in syllabics.

The story takes place on the fictional island of Anopopei in the South Pacific and is about American soldiers trying to drive off the Japanese so that they can advance into the Philippines.
Staff Sergeant Sam Croft, Woodrow Wilson, and Roy Gallagher are playing cards the night before a scheduled attack. They are members of a recon platoon fighting on Anopopei. The next morning, as the platoon takes boats to the island, they are nervous. Sgt. William Brown and Cpl. Stanley talk about women and the other men in their squad. The assault begins, and as the platoon waits for their turn to come to the island, they nervously joke among themselves. Once the squad reaches the beach, they dig foxholes. Stanley picks a fight with Oscar Ridges and Red Valsen, but ultimately Red knows the time is not right for a fight, and he backs down. Croft leaves to find his commanding officer. Once they’ve begun to settle in on the beach, the Japanese attack. The squad splits up. Cpl. Toglio, Hennessey, and Ridges have completed their foxholes, so they stay on the beach. Brown, Gallagher, Wilson, Red, Stanley, and Sgt. Julio Martinez run after Croft. As the beach is shelled, Hennessey panics and soils himself. He runs down the beach to try to clean his pants, but he is killed.

Croft pleads with higher officers to give him more men to replace those lost. He ultimately earns an extra replacement man, bringing the squad up to fourteen. Roth and Goldstein, two of the new men in the platoon, become friends because they are both Jewish.


The publisher would not let the word "fuck" be in the novel, so Mailer used the word "fug" to replace it.

These are caused by many reasons. One factor is they retire earlier due to marriage, pregnancy and maternity.
In Japan, Go players are always compared with shogi players. This is because newspapers like Asahi Shinbun treat them equal. But there is a big difference among female players. Female Go players usually belong to the same organization with others. But this does not happen for shogi. Female shogi players belong to the Ladies Professional Shogi Association (LPSA). The others belong to the Japan Shogi Association (JSA). Some LPSA players like Kana Satomi have tried to enter JSA. But currently, no one has entered.

Kansai Ki-in has eased the age rules to female players. At Nihon Ki-in, there is a special exam for female players. Most female professionals (except Xie Yimin and Keiko Kato etc.) have got their pro status by this way. In 2019, Nihon Ki-in has started a female player test system to give more support to them. Nihon Ki-in is also sponsoring female amateur games.
This is a tournament operated with the All Japan Student Go Federation. Some winners have got pro status, or became top amateur players. Only players who cleared regional games can attend.

The All Japan Female Amateur Go Championship is the highest match for female amateur Go players. Some winners have became a pro. The next table shows the notable winners.

Old Town, Edinburgh

The Old Town () is oldest part of Edinburgh. It preserved much of its medieval street plan and buildings. Together with New Town, it forms a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The main street in the Old Town is called the "Royal Mile". It runs on a downwards path from Edinburgh Castle to Holyrood Palace and the ruined Holyrood Abbey. 

The streets are not officially called The Royal Mile in terms of legal addresses. The actual street names (running west to east) are Castlehill, Lawnmarket, High Street, Canongate and Abbey Strand. 

Notable buildings in the Old Town include St. Giles' Cathedral, the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland, the National Museum of Scotland, the Old College of the University of Edinburgh and the Scottish Parliament Building. The area is known to have underground vaults and hidden passages that are relics of old phases of construction.
In addition to the Royal Mile, the Old Town may be divided into various areas from west to east:


In 1824, a major fire known as Great Fire of Edinburgh, destroyed most of the buildings on the south side of the High Street. During the Edinburgh International Festival, the High Street and Hunter Square become gathering points. Performers in the Fringe advertise their shows, often through street performances.

On 7 December 2002, the Cowgate fire destroyed a small but dense group of old buildings on the Cowgate and South Bridge. It destroyed the famous comedy club, The Gilded Balloon. Other areas affected were the Informatics Department of the University of Edinburgh. The vast artificial intelligence library was also damaged. The site was redeveloped 2013-2014. There now stands a single new building which largely used as a hotel.

St Martin's Church, Canterbury

The Church of St Martin is an old Church of England church in Canterbury, England. It is best known as having the longest continuous history as a parish church in the English-speaking world. It is often known as "The first church founded in England". Although there were already Roman and Celtic churches had existed for centuries. Together with the Canterbury Cathedral and St Augustine's Abbey, they are part of a World Heritage Site.

Since 1668 the church has been part of the benefice of St Martin and St Paul Canterbury. Both St Martin's and nearby St Paul's churches are used for weekly services. The current rector of the parish is the Reverend Mark Richard Griffin.

St Martin's was the private chapel of Queen Bertha of Kent (died in or after 601). Queen Bertha was a Christian Frankish princess who arrived in England with her chaplain, Bishop Liudhard. Her pagan husband, King Æthelberht of Kent, let her to continue to practise her religion by renovating (ca. AD 580) an existing church. As Bede named it, this church was dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours. It is the city located near where Bertha grew up.

Upon Augustine's arrival, he used St Martin's as his mission headquarters. King Æthelberht was baptised here. When Canterbury Cathedral and St Augustine's Abbey were established, St Martin's lost its initial prestige. However, it still remains of historical importance.

Local finds prove that Christianity did exist in this area of the city at the time. The church contains many reused Roman bricks or spolia. It also has complete sections of walls of Roman tiles. At the core of the church the brick remains of a Roman tomb were integrated into the structure. Several sections of walls are clearly very early. It is possible that a blocked square-headed doorway in the chancel was the entrance to Bertha's church. Meanwhile, other sections of wall come from the period after the Gregorian mission in the 7th or 8th centuries. The apse that was originally at the east end has been removed. The tower came much later, in Perpendicular style. The church is a Grade I listed building.

Many notable local families and well-known graves were buried in its churchyard. These people include: 


The church has a continuing musical tradition from the monks of St Augustine to the present day. The choral director for the parish is Dom del Nevo.

The tower has three bells set for swing-chiming using levers. 



Euronews

Euronews (styled euronews) is a European television news network, headquartered in Brussels, Belgium. The network began broadcasting on 1 January 1993 and covers world news from a European perspective. It is a provider of livestreamed news, which can be viewed in most of the world via its website, on YouTube, and on various mobile devices and digital media players. The service is also aimed at the overseas market, similar to TV Brasil Internacional, ABC Australia, TVP Polonia, Fox Business Network, Bloomberg Television, CNBC, CNN International, CNN, ESPNews, DD India, BBC News, MSNBC, Al Jazeera English, France 24, Phoenix InfoNews Channel, RTP Internacional, TVE Internacional, Rai Italia, CCTV-4, CGTN, DW, TV5Monde, NHK World, Arirang, KBS World, RT, BBC Parliament, CBC News Network, Fox News Channel, Canal del Congreso, CPAC, C-SPAN, BBC One, CBC Television, PBS and RTR-Planeta.

In 1992, following the Persian Gulf War, during which rival cable and satellite international television news channel CNN's position as the preeminent source of 24-hour news programming was cemented, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) proposed a channel to present information from a counterpart European perspective. The inaugural Euronews broadcast was on 1 January 1993 from Écully, Lyon. In 1996, an additional broadcast studio was set up in London.

In late 1997, the British news broadcaster ITN purchased a 49% share of Euronews for £5.1 million from Alcatel-Lucent. ITN supplied the content of the channel along with the remaining shareholders.

In 1999, the broadcast switched from solely analogue to mainly digital transmission. The same year, a Portuguese audio track was added.

In 2001, the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (VGTRK) acquired a 1.8% stake in SOCEMIE. A Russian-language service was launched later in the year.

In April 2003, ITN sold its stake in Euronews as part of its drive to streamline operations and focus on news-gathering rather than channel management.

On 6 February 2006, Ukrainian public broadcaster Natsionalna Telekompanya Ukraïny (NTU) purchased a one percent interest in SOCEMIE.

In 2007, Euronews won the European Commission's tender for an Arabic-language news channel, with a service agreement being signed on 6 December. The Arabic service would eventually be launched in July 2008.

On 27 May 2008, Spanish public broadcaster RTVE decided to leave Euronews, citing legal requirements to maintain low debt levels through careful spending as a factor influencing its decision to leave, as well as to promote its international channel TVE Internacional.

In February 2009, the Turkish public broadcaster TRT became a shareholder in the channel and joined its supervisory board. TRT purchased 15.70% of the channel's shares and became the fourth main partner after France Télévisions (23.93%), RAI (21.54%), and VGTRK (16.94%). Subsequently, Turkish was added as the ninth language service in January 2010. Later that year in October, the channel started broadcasting in Persian, then began broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen format in early 2011, and launched a Ukrainian service in August. A Polish service was launched in mid-2011 amid Poland's accession to the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, although only some selected evening broadcasts were translated. It was shortly after discontinued in January 2012.

In February 2015, the channel's executive board approved a bid by Media Globe Networks, owned by Egyptian telecom magnate Naguib Sawiris, to acquire a 53% controlling stake in the media outlet. The deal raised questions over Euronews's future editorial posture and independence.

On 13 March 2015, it was announced that Inter Media Group, owned by pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, had taken over the Ukrainian service. In response, the Ukrainian government decided to revoke its broadcasting license for its suspected bias and dropped its funding. Firtash later abandoned the project, resulting in the department shutting down and leaving 17 journalists redundant. The Russian service, which was financed by Moscow, refused to provide jobs to the journalists, in violation of French labour legislation. The management explained that not hiring any Ukrainian journalists was a specific instruction from VGTRK.

In October 2015, Euronews moved to a new global headquarters complex in La Confluence, Lyon, designed by Paris-based architecture firm Jakob + MacFarlane and covering a floor area of 10,000 m2 (21⁄2 acres).
The decision to move was announced prior to the majority takeover by Media Globe Networks.

In November 2016, the channel's executive board was in talks with NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News, for a "strategic partnership". NBCU would acquire 15 to 30% ownership of the Euronews network, would contribute to Euronews content, and facilitate NBC News' expanded operations in Europe. After successful negotiations with the European Commission, who feared that the partnership would result in an "Americanization" of Euronews, the NBCUniversal News Group finally purchased a 25% stake in Euronews in February 2017 for $30 million. NBC News president Deborah Turness was appointed to head up international operations, and incumbent Euronews CEO Michael Peters, who had led it since 2004, became CEO of the new partnership. Both reported directly to NBC News chairman Andrew Lack. The resulting partnership became known as Euronews NBC.

In May 2017, Euronews went from having one TV channel with 13 audio tracks, to 10 separate TV channels and 12 websites. This is part of a ’"glocal"’ idea. Now, certain language editions can offer their own selections of local and global news. By doing this, the Arabic and Persian services stopped TV broadcasting, and they are now only on social media and the Euronews website. The Ukrainian service was closed because the Ukrainian government was not giving it money.

In 2018, the English Euronews channel started its first news shows with live presenters. Then, other Euronews language editions did the same and started their own presented evening news shows too.

On 20 April 2020, it was reported that NBCUniversal had sold its stake in Euronews to Media Globe Networks, eventually having an overall majority share of 88%. NBCUniversal's parent company Comcast had recently acquired pan-European satellite service Sky Group, and was prioritizing a collaboration between NBC News and Sky News on a new international news channel. The proposed service was scrapped in August during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, with the project no longer considered commercially viable.

In December 2021, reports surfaced that British-based BBC would buy an 88% controlling stake in Euronews.

Euronews was banned (stopped to be broadcast) in Belarus by its government's decision since April 12, 2021.

Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape

The Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape is a World Heritage site. It includes select mining landscapes in Cornwall and West Devon. The site was added to the on July 2006. Plans to restart mining at South Crofty, and to build a supermarket at Hayle Harbour, caused its status to be questioned.

The World Heritage Committee considered placing the site on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2014. This proposal was rejected. Instead, they agreed on a follow-up "Reactive Monitoring Mission".

Devon made around 25-40% of the amount of tin that Cornwall did up to the mid-16th century. However, the total amount of tin made in both Cornwall and Devon at this time was relatively small. After the 1540s, Cornwall's production took off while Devon's production was only about between a ninth to a tenth of that of Cornwall.

From the mid-16th century onwards, the Devon Stannaries were giving very little in income to the King. They were sidelined after the Supremacy of Parliament Act 1512.

The landscapes of Cornwall and West Devon were reshaped during the 18th and 19th centuries by the mining of copper and tin. The underground mines, engine houses, foundries, new towns, smallholdings, ports, harbours, and other supporting industries together meant the region produced "two-thirds of the world's supply of copper". 

During the late 19th century, arsenic production came to the east of Cornwall and West Devon. As a result, the region supplied half the world’s demand. 
The World Heritage site consists of individual but topical linked areas around Cornwall and West Devon. The areas (with the area codes from the site nomination) are:


Devon and Cornwall rocks were once in the core of huge volcanic mountains. Those rocks usually contain more heavy metallic elements than usually found on the Earth's surface. A recent news item says a new mineral was found in Cornwall called Kernowite.

Rocks from ocean floor mid-ocean ridges (oceanic lithosphere) may come to the surface under orogeny as ophiolites. Wherever there is a large ground-down mountain chain there may be a source of heavy metals.

Spanish naming customs

Spanish naming customs are traditions for naming children as used in Spain. 

A person's name consists of a given name (simple or composite) followed by two surnames. Historically, "the first surname was the father's first surname", and the second the mother's first surname. 

In recent years, the order of the surnames in a family is done when registering the first child. However, the traditional order is still largely the choice. Often, the practice is to use one given name and the first surname most of the time (e.g. "Miguel de Unamuno" for Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo). The complete name being usually reserved for legal, formal, and documentary matters. 

Both surnames are sometimes used when the first surname is very common (e.g., Federico García Lorca, Pablo Ruiz Picasso or José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero) to get a more customized name. In these cases, it is even common to use only the second surname, as in "Lorca", "Picasso" or "Zapatero". This does not affect alphabetization: "Lorca", the Spanish poet, must be alphabetized in an index under "García Lorca" and not "Lorca".

Small Maracanazo

The Small Maracanazo was an historical football match, played in 1971 between the Champion teams of Venezuela and Brazil in Rio de Janeiro.

In 1971, the Deportivo Italia, Venezuela's Champion of the 1971 season (and the team of the Italians of Venezuela), defeated the Fluminense FC, Champion of Brazil, 1:0 (with a goal done by central defender Tenorio) at the Maracana stadium.

The Caracas daily 'El Universal' wrote that:

"... the night of 3 March 1971 will never be forgotten by the fans of Fluminense, who followed on radio and television the match against Deportivo Italia. More than 26,000 people went to the Maracana. The modest Venezuelan team, thrashed in their own field in the previous match, did what no none could do for over a year, not even the powerful Brazilian teams: defeat the Fluminense in their Maracana. That fateful night, Deportivo Italia achieved the victory more enjoyable in the Venezuelan national football history, winning in the largest stadium in the world the Champion of Brazil.."

The Deportivo Italia – under the direct supervision of Mino D'Ambrosio (who ruled the team with his brother Pompeo D'Ambrosio)– that night went to the match with Vito Fasano (who for his performance was recruited in Brazil, Vito is Italian) as goalkeeper. At the defence there were Carlos "Chiquichagua" Marín, Tenorio, Vincente Arrud and Freddy Elie, while as midfielders Delman "Pito" Useche, Negri and Rui. In the attack played Alcyr (who was replaced by Bahia), Beto and Militello.

In the magazine "Incontri" of Caracas, Bruno D'Ambrosio (grandson of Mino who attended the match) wrote that in the final half hour the goalkeeper Vito Fassano did miracles: three hits to the poles helped him, but while two knocked externally the door defended by Fassano, the third would have been goal if the goalkeeper had not deflected it with his fingers stretching in an incredible way. Fassano made the best game of his life, according to sport journalists.

When the Deportivo Italia went back to Venezuela, the players were welcomed by the Italian supporters of the team with one week of celebrations: the victory it is still considered the best achievement -in the football world history- by a Venezuela team. Furthermore, the victory was the most famous achievement of the D'ambrosio brothers (Mino and Pompeo) rule of the team in the sixties and seventies of the XX century.

The match was played in the worldwide famous Maracanã Stadium of Rio de Janeiro. Over 50000 supporters of the Fluminense saw (in the stadium and outside) their team defeated 1 - 0 by the modest team from Caracas. All the sport-media in Latinoamerica were shocked, because the Fluminense was trained by Lobo Zagalo who had just won the World football Cup in 1970. One of the owners of the Fluminense died of heart attack during the final minutes of the match.

Hahoe Village hosts cultural events, including traditional mask dances. It is in the city of Andong, in North Gyeongsang Province. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The people who built the town used Confucian philosophy and the clan system to decide where to put each building and road. The clan system was very important in Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. Some of the houses are made of wood and some are made of mud. Some of the houses have tile roofs and some have thatched roofs. Some of the buildings are made of traditional materials and some have been rebuilt with modern materials. There is a 600 year old zelkova tree in the village. People have named the tree "Samsindang," and there is a shrine next to it. Unlike many homes in South Korea, which face south, the houses in Hahoe Village face the tree. The Byeongsanseowon Confucian Academy is 4 km east of the village.

People still live in Hahoe Folk Village. Many of them are members of the Ryu clan who have lived there since the 1400s. There are about 127 households in Hahoe Folk Village. Some of them still have a "jongga" or head of the family and practice ancestor worship in the Confucian way.

Hahoe Folk Village is known for its traditional outdoor mask performances. Most traditional masks in Korea are made out of calabash and are used only once. Masks in Hahoe are made from wood, usually alder wood, and are reused many times.

Hahoe Folk Village also hosts Seonyu Julbul Nori. On the birthday of the spiritual leader Buddha, people ride down the Nakdong River in boats. People read poetry. There is also a display called line fire. This is a special way of lighting fireworks. Mulberry tree charcoal is put in long pouches that are tied every few centimeters on their length. The pouches are attached to a rope made of straw, one pouch every five meters. The rope is long enough to go between two trees. One end of one charcoal pouch is lit, and it takes a long time for all the charcoal to burn down the whole length of the rope.
The name "Hahoe" comes from "ha" for "river" and "hoe" for "turn around" in Korean. The village is built right where the Nakdong River turns around. 

In 2020, the village added a traditional brushwood bridge near Hahoe Folk Village.

Queen Elizabeth II visited Hahoe Folk village in 2019.

Creswell Crags

Creswell Crags is a limestone gorge on the border between Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, England. It is near the villages of Creswell and Whitwell. 

The cliffs in the ravine have several caves. The caves were occupied during the last ice age, between around 43,000 and 10,000 years ago. They have the northernmost cave art in Europe. The evidence of occupation is found in the rich series of sediments that accumulated over many thousands of years. It is internationally unique in showing how prehistoric people lived at the extreme northernmost limits of their territory in the later Pleistocene Ice Age.

The caves have layers with flint tools from the Mousterian, and later cultures. They were seasonally occupied by nomadic groups of people during the Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods. Evidence of Neolithic, Bronze Age, Roman and post-medieval activity has also been found there. There is evidence of Neanderthal occupation 50,000–60,000 years ago, a brief Gravettian occupation around 32,000 years ago and use of all the main caves during the Magdalenian around 14,000 years ago. The site is open to the public and has a visitor centre with a small museum of objects.

Creswell Crags has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It has also been put forward as a potential World Heritage Site.

In 2006–07, the B6042 road was re-routed from its path through the gorge, by approximately to the north, to minimise traffic impact on the site.


The most occupied caves were:

Gough Island

Gough Island (), historically known as Gonçalo Álvares, is a rugged volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a dependency of Tristan da Cunha. It is part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gough and Inaccessible Islands. 

It is about south-east of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago (which includes Nightingale Island and Inaccessible Island), , north-east from South Georgia Island, west from Cape Town. It is over from the nearest point of South America.

Nobody lives on Gough Island except for the workers of a weather station, which is usually six people. The South African National Antarctic Programme has maintained the island with British permission since 1956. It is one of the most remote places with a people always being there. 

The island was first named "Ilha de Gonçalo Álvares" on Portuguese maps. It was named Gough Island after the British mariner Captain Charles Gough of the "Richmond", who first saw the island in 1732. Confusion of the unusual Portuguese saint name Gonçalo with Spanish Diego led to the wrong name Diego Alvarez Island in English-language sources from the 1800s to 1930s. 

However, the most likely explanation is that it was simply a misreading of 'Is de Go Alvarez', the name by which the island is represented on some of the early charts, the 'de Go' mutating into 'Diego'.

The details of the discovery of Gough Island are unclear, but the most likely occasion is July 1505 by the Portuguese explorer Gonçalo Álvares. Maps during the next three centuries named the island after him. On some later maps, this was erroneously given as Diego Alvarez.

According to some historians, the British merchant Anthony de la Roché was the first to land on the island in the austral autumn of 1675.

Charles Gough rediscovered the island on 3 March 1732. He thought it was a new find. It had been named Gonçalo Álvares since 1505 after the captain of Vasco da Gama's flagship on his epic voyage to the east. It was under this name that it was marked with reasonable accuracy on the charts of the South Atlantic during the following 230 or so years. 

Then, in 1732, Captain Gough of the British ship "Richmond" reported the discovery of a new island. He placed it 400 miles to the east of Gonçalo Álvares. Fifty years later, cartographers realised that the two islands were the same. Despite the priority of the Portuguese discovery, and the greater accuracy of the position given by them, "Gough's Island" was the name adopted.

In the early 19th century, sealers briefly inhabited the island. The earliest known example is a sealing gang from the U.S. ship "Rambler" (Captain Joseph Bowditch) which remained on the island in the 1804–1805 season. The sealing era lasted from 1804 to 1910 during which 34 sealing vessels are known to have visited the island, one of which was lost offshore.

The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition on the "Scotia" made the first visit to the island by a scientific party on 21 April 1904, when William Speirs Bruce and others collected specimens. The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition also stopped at the island in 1922.

Gough Island was formally claimed in 1938 for Britain, during a visit by HMS "Milford" of the Royal Navy. In 1995, the island was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2004, the site was extended to include Inaccessible Island and renamed Gough and Inaccessible Islands.

Gough Island is the only place outside South America from which the solar eclipse of September 12, 2034, will be visible; the centre of the path of totality crosses over the island.

Gough Island is roughly rectangular with a length of and a width of . It has an area of and rises to heights of over above sea level. Topographic features include the highest peak, Edinburgh Peak, Hags Tooth, Mount Rowett, Sea Elephant Bay, Quest Bay, and Hawkins Bay.

It includes small satellite islands and rocks such as Southwest Island, Saddle Island (South), Tristiana Rock, Isolda Rock (West), Round Island, Cone Island, Lot's Wife, Church Rock (North), Penguin Island (Northeast), and The Admirals (East).

According to the Köppen system, Gough Island features an oceanic climate ("Cfb"). Gough Island's temperatures are between and during the day year-round, due to its isolated position far out in the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic is much cooler in the southern hemisphere than the northern, but frosts are still very rare. As a result, summers are not very hot. It features a similar climate to the Fiordland area of New Zealand, the west coast of Scotland, or the Alaskan Panhandle. Precipitation is high during the entire year, and sunshine hours are few. Snow falls in the interior, but is rare at sea level.
A weather station has been running on Gough Island since 1956. It is operated as part of the network of the South African Weather Service. Because cold fronts approach South Africa from the south-west, the Gough station is particularly important in forecasting winter weather. Initially it was housed in the station at The Glen, but moved in 1963 to the South lowlands of the island, more precisely . The new location improved the validity and reliability of the data acquired for use in modeling.

Each year a new overwintering team arrives by ship from Cape Town (beginning in 2012, the "S. A. Agulhas II") to staff the weather station and perform scientific research. The team for a particular year may be termed as "Gough" and an expedition number: for example, the 1956 team were "Gough 01", and the team for 2013 were "Gough 58". Each new team directly replaces the departing one, thereby maintaining a continual human presence on the island.

A team normally consists of:


The team is supplied with enough food to last the whole year. People and cargo are landed either by helicopter, from a helideck-equipped supply ship, or by a fixed crane atop a cliff near the station (a place aptly called "Crane Point").

In 2014 a member of the research team choked to death on the island and his body was taken back to South Africa.

Replay value (colloquially known as replayability) is a term used to figure out how fun it is to play a game after the player completed it already. Factors that may change the replay value are the game's additional characters, secrets or multiple endings.

St. George's, Bermuda

St. George's (formally known as the Town of St. George, or St. George's Town) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. First settlers were there since 1612. It is the first permanent English settlement on the islands of Bermuda. It is usually described as the third successful British settlement in the Americas. It is the oldest British town in the New World where people continue to live up to this day. 

In the Bermudian convention where the name of the place has the name of a person, it sets the person's name in the possessive form. The place is rarely treated as equivalent to the person. 

Other examples include most of the parishes (which – other than St. George's Parish – all commemorate historical people). It includes churches such as Hamilton Parish (named for James Hamilton, 2nd Marquess of Hamilton), Devonshire Parish (named for William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire), and Paget Parish. While the city of Hamilton is commonly referred to as "Hamilton", The Town of St. George, St. George's Parish, St. George's Island, and St. George's Harbour (and any other names of the place usually containing a person's name in the possessive form). It always remains possessive when shortened, such as in the "St. George's Foundation".

For example, Bermudians will always say "St. George's and St. David's are the largest islands in St. George's Parish." It is never "St. George and St. David are the largest islands in St. George Parish". As many maps and other printed materials featuring Bermuda are produced abroad, it is extremely common to find maps, books and other material using the non-possessive forms. However, visitors to Bermuda should be aware that using the non-possessive forms when speaking to Bermudians is likely to cause as much offence as saying "Bermudan". 

Originally called "New London", St. George's was first settled in 1612. This was three years after the first English settlers landed on St. George's Island on their way to Virginia. Led by Admiral Sir George Somers and Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Gates, they had deliberately steered their ship, "Sea Venture," to a reef to escape a storm. The survivors built two new ships, the "Deliverance" and "Patience", and most continued their voyage to Jamestown, but the Virginia Company laid claim to the island.

By the Virginia Company's Third Charter in 1612, the boundaries of the new colony were extended to include Bermuda. The company sent a party of 60 new settlers to Bermuda to join the three men left behind by the "Sea Venture." After a brief period in nearby St. David's, the settlers started building at St. George's. By 1615, the shareholders of the Virginia Company created a second company, the Somers Isles Company. It managed Bermuda separately until the company was dissolved in 1686. The Virginia Company was later dissolved in 1624. 

This small town was the capital of Bermuda until 1815. It was linked to the history of colonial America. Ten thousand Bermudians moved to Virginia and the American Southeast. This was before United States independence made them citizens of separate nations. Branches of wealthy Bermudian merchant families ruled the trade in the area's ports. 

As Bermuda's population centre, St. George's was connected to the development in the North American colonies. During the American War of Independence, and as requested by George Washington, Bermudians assisted the American rebels in stealing much-needed gunpowder from a St. George's magazine. It supplied the forts protecting that were protecting the port. 

In 1996, the town was twinned with Lyme Regis, Dorset, England. It was the birthplace of Admiral Sir George Somers. In 2000, the town, together with numerous surrounding fortifications, including the Castle Islands Fortifications, they were added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Together, they are formally known as the "Historic Town of St George and Related Fortifications".

St. George's Colts and Hamilton Parish football clubs play their games at the Wellington Oval, which also serves as a cricket ground.

St. George's Preschool serves the area. St. George's Primary School is in the community.

Gorham's Cave

Gorham's Cave is a sea-level cave in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. Although it is not a sea cave, it is often mistaken for one. It is considered to be one of the last known habitations of the Neanderthals in Europe. The cave's name, Gorham's Cave complex, is a combination of four distinct caves that are part of the UNESCO World Heritage site. It is the only one in Gibraltar. The three other caves are Vanguard Cave, Hyaena Cave, and Bennett's Cave.

It is located at Governor's Beach on the southeastern face of the Rock of Gibraltar. People lived there about 55,000 years ago. It was approximately 5 kilometres from the shore, but, due to changes in sea level, it is now only a few metres from the Mediterranean Sea.

The cave is named after Captain A. Gorham. He discovered it in 1907 while opening a fissure at the rear of a sea cavern. Gorham wrote his name and the date of his discovery in lamp-black on the wall of the cave. It has his name ever since. After this initial discovery, it seems the cave was forgotten, at least at an official level. Gibraltarian historian and potholer George Palao recalls an inscription on the cave wall that read "J. J. Davies 1943".

Gorham's Cave is a sea cave which has formed in Jurassic limestone. Total length of this cave is approximately 100 m and at the entrance it is approximately 35 m high. Further inside the cave, it becomes narrower, and turns per approximately 90 degrees. From the entrance of cave opens a view on the Alboran Sea. It is possible that during further research the cave will become longer.

Gorham's Cave got its name Gorham's Cave complex. It is a grouping of four distinct caves of such importance that they are combined into a UNESCO heritage site. The three other caves are the nearby Vanguard Cave, the Hyaena Cave, and Bennett's Cave.

In November 2010, the Gorham's Cave complex was put forward to compete for a nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Professor Clive Finlayson, director of the Gibraltar Museum, was responsible for coordinating the efforts to obtain this nomination. The first step was a proposal to the United Kingdom cultural authorities to get Gorham's Cave complex added to the UK's World Heritage tentative list. The list is changed every ten years. The process for a new list was ongoing at the date of the submission.

The ownership of land associated with Gorham's Cave was passed from the UK Ministry of Defence to the government of Gibraltar in 2011. The agreement swapped this MOD land and more than 300 MOD houses with the government of Gibraltar, who in exchange agreed to build 90 new houses on remaining MOD land.

In May 2012 Gorham's Cave complex was on the short list of two sites, along with the Forth Rail Bridge, that was forwarded for submission to UNESCO. The site was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site on 15 July 2016, and is Gibraltar's only World Heritage site.

Roman Theatre of Orange

The Roman Theatre of Orange (French: "Théâtre antique d'Orange") is a Roman theatre in Orange, Vaucluse, France. It was built early in the 1st century AD. The municipality of Orange owns the structure. The theatre is the home of the summer opera festival called the Chorégies d'Orange.

It is a very well preserved Roman theatres. It served the Roman colony of "Arausio" (more specifically, "Colonia Julia Firma Secundanorum Arausio": "the Julian colony of Arausio started by the soldiers of the second legion"). This colony was founded in 40 BC. The theatre played an important role in the life of the citizens. They spent a large part of their free time there.The Roman authorities saw it as a way to spread spreading Roman culture to the colonies. They also saw it as a way to make them forget about political activities.

Mime, pantomime, poetry readings and the "attelana" (a kind of farce, similar to the commedia dell'arte) were the most important forms of entertainment. It often lasted all day. The common people liked spectacular effects and beautiful stage sets became very important. The use of stage machinery also became important. The entertainment was open to everyone. It was free of charge.

The Western Roman Empire declined during the 4th century. Christianity had become the official religion. An official edict closed the theatre in AD 391. This is because at that time the Church was against what it saw as uncivilised performances. The Visigoths probably pillaged it in 412. Like most Roman buildings, a lot of its better stone was used again for other buildings. It was used as a defensive post in the early Middle Ages. By the 12th century, the Church started to use it for religious plays. During the 16th-century there were religious wars. The theatre became a place to hide for the townspeople. In 1981 UNESCO declared the theatre as a World Heritage Site. In modern days, it is used mostly for opera. It is also a tourist attraction.

The Romans made early Roman theatres mostly with wood. They were meant to be temporary structures. In 55 BC Pompey asked for a stone theatre in his home city of Rome. After this, important (and permanent) Roman theatres became more popular in the Empire. The Orange theatre was built under the rule of Augustus. It was one of the first of its kind in this area of France. The grand exterior (outside) facade is one of the most famous parts of the structure. It is 103 meters long and 37 meters high. At the beginning, there was a wooden roof across the theatre. This protected the people watching from bad weather. There is evidence on the walls that shows that, at some point, the roof burnt in a fire. There is not very much decoration on the theatre. However, the tall wall gives an imposing look to the whole building. The three main doors on the first level of the facade open directly onto the stage inside the theatre. The theatre can seat between 5,800 up to 7,300. Today, much of the seating is new. This is to make sure that tourists and people watching plays are safe. 

The stage is 61 meters long. It is about one meter above the ground. To the back is the wall. Its height is the same as in Roman times. This wall is very important to the theatre. This is because it helps to make the sound louder for the large audience. The wall is also known as the scaenae frons. It is the only place with decoration in the entire theatre. It used to have marble mosaics of many different colours. It also had many columns, friezes and statues placed in niches. The central niche contains a statue of the emperor Augustus. This was likely a restoration of an original statue of Apollo, the god of music and the arts. The central door, below the central niche, is called the Royal Door, or "valva regia." Only by the most important actors used this door to enter and exit the stage. Above the door there was a frieze decorated with centaurs. It is not there anymore. It is now on display across the street in the Orange Museum. Only some parts of it are left. The stage now has a modern platform. This is to stop damage when actors use it for operas and other performances.

The reconstruction (building again) of the theatre started in 1825. People wanted to bring back the theatre to its original use: to host large, exciting performances. In 1869, the theatre was still being restored. It hosted “The Roman Festivals,” which brought over 10,000 guests. A very important part of the restoration was excavating the area around the theatre. This happened in the 1930s. This excavation and levelling of buildings around the theatre helped find many historical objects and artifacts. These helped make knowledge better about the history and uses of the structure. Today, all three levels of seating have been completely restored. This is the same for many staircases, large parts of the pavement, the stage, the orchestra, and parts of walls.

During the Middle Ages, around the 12th century, the Church used the theatre to host plays. Theatre companies also hosted plays. In the 16th century this tradition stopped once again when the town was sacked during The French Wars of Religion. Much of the population left.In the 19th century, the theatre went back to its original use. Today, the Orange theatre is considered the best preserved (kept) Roman theatre in all of Europe. Culturespaces manages it. This is an organisation that also manages other related cultural sites in the area, for example the Orange Museum and the Triumphal Arch. It also manages other sites in the South of France. 

The theatre is a historical site, but also a venue for concerts and theatrical performances. The first major festival held in the theatre in 1869 after the restoration started was called “The Roman Festival”. This festival became a yearly festival called the Chorégies (see below). These decadent events brought in thousands of visitors from around the world. During the rest of the year, the Théâtre d'Orange is a major tourist attraction. Tourists can walk through the main theatre and rooms around it. They can also walk through the corridors.

During the 19th century, the theatre slowly started to look better again. Prosper Mérimée helped with this. At the time, he was the director of ""Monuments Historiques"." He led the restoration. The work began in 1825 and in 1869 the theatre became the home of a "Roman Festival" which celebrated the glory of Rome. It included a performance of Méhul's opera, "Joseph". In the second half of the 19th century, and early 20th century, all the major players of the French classical stage appeared in the Orange festivals. For example, Sarah Bernhardt played "Phèdre" there in 1903.

By the end of the century, the tiered seats were restored. In 1902 the festival had a new name, the "Chorégies". It was planned as a yearly summer festival. The name comes from the tax that wealthy Romans had to pay for theatre productions. Until 1969 the Chorégies consisted of plays and musical works, for example opera and symphonies. However, after that date, it became just an opera festival. Plays were done at Avignon.

In 1981 UNESCO made the theatre a World Heritage Site.


Chatham Dockyard

Chatham Dockyard was a Royal Navy Dockyard located on the River Medway in Kent. It was established in Chatham in the mid-16th century. The dockyard was then expanded into neighbouring Gillingham. Chatham Dockyards and its Defences are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

It existed after the Reformation. It was at a time when relations with the Catholic countries of Europe had worsened, which increased the need for additional defences.

For 414 years, 500 ships were made available for the Royal Navy because of Chatham Royal Dockyard. It was at the forefront of shipbuilding, industrial and architectural technology. At its height, it employed over 10,000 skilled artisans. It covered . 

Chatham Dockyard was closed in 1984. The Georgian dockyard is now managed as the Chatham Historic Dockyard. It is a visitor attraction by the Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust. 



No War but the Class War

No War but the Class War is a slogan that is used by people who do not like capitalism. It means that people should not go fight in wars, which they believe support the rich and powerful, but fight the rich and powerful instead (in a special kind of war called "class struggle").

This slogan has been used in many arts and shows.

Some groups have used the name "No War but the Class War." These groups appeared in London around the time that the Gulf War and the Kosovo War were taking place.

Yangdong Folk Village

Yangdong Folk Village is a village in South Korea's North Gyeongsang Province. It is inside the city of Gyeongju, which used to be the capital of Korea. It has buildings and other things that were built in the Joseon Dynasty or that have been rebuilt in the same style. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Yangdong was built in the 1400s by two important clans, Yeogang Lee and Wolseong Son. Many of the people who live in Yangdong now are from these families. Many members of these families who do not live in Yangdong come back a few times a year for special occasions.

Yangdong Folk Village is a World Heritage Site as part of a pair with Hahoe Folk Village. Both places were built during the Joseon Dynasty and many of the buildings are still intact. Some of the buildings have been rebuilt with modern materials, though. Like Hahoe, Yangdong's layout shows influences from the Confucian way of thinking and the importance of the clan system in Korea at the time. There are timber houses with tiled roofs for high-ranking people and mud houses with thatched roofs that were originally for low-ranking people. The village is on the sides of hills. The buildings were built in specific places so their rooftops would match and complement the hillsides around them. The buildings belonging to nobler or richer people are higher up on the hills. One home once had 99 rooms.

There are two Confucian schools, Oksanseowon and Donggangseowon, near Yangdong Folk Village.

There are about 149 houses in Yangdong Folk Village and people still live in them. Yangdong Folk Village has modern, paved roads, some modern bridges, and a railway.

Before it was declared a World Heritage Site around 2010, few people visited Yangdong. After it was declared a World Heritage Site, many more came. People worried about whether the extra visitors would damage the site. Tourists, including schoolchildren on field trips, often visit Yangdong.

Famous people from Yangdong include the Joseon era philosopher Lee Eon-jeok (1491-1553), nicknamed "Hoejae." Hojae is called one of the "Five Great Sages of the East."

The complex of Koguryo tombs or Goguryeo tombs is a group of tombs, or places where human bodies are buried, in North Korea. The tombs were built during the Kingdom of Koguryo, which ruled parts of China and Korea from 37 BCE. to the 7th century CE. These tombs were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.

The tombs are made of stonework and earthwork and some of them have large, detailed paintings inside them. Historians have found about 10,000 tombs from the Koguryo kingdom in China and Korea. Only about 100 of them have paintings on the inside. 80 of these painted tombs are in what we today call the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or North Korea. 63 tombs are part of the World Heritage Site, and 16 of these tombs have paintings. They were chosen because their paintings are so detailed and show daily life, because the way they were built shows good engineering, because modern people can use the tombs to tell what the people of the Kingdom of Koguryo thought about burying people, and because the burials in the Kingdom of Koguryo affected many later countries, including the modern Koreas and Japan.

The 63 tombs of the World Heritage Site are not all in the same place. They are spread out across the city of Pyongyang and nearby provinces. Historians think these tombs were made for kings and other royals and nobles.

Sometimes experts from North Korea and South Korea work together on the Koguryo tombs, but this depends on how well the two countries are getting along.

Thieves and other looters broke into some of the tombs, and only a few were completely untouched when scientists first saw them.

In 2018, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea began to allow more visitors from outside the country to see the tombs. This was part of a plan to improve the economy.

In May 2020, the National Museum of Korea in Seoul, South Korea, produced a digital exhibit called Immersive Digital Galleries. This exhibit included digital versions of some of the paintings from the Anak No. 3 tomb.

Cladoxylopsida

The cladoxylopsids are a group of plants known only as fossils that may be ancestors of ferns and horsetails.

They had a central trunk, from the top of which several lateral branches were attached. Fossils of these plants start in the middle Devonian to early Carboniferous periods, mostly just as stems.

Cladoxylopsida contains two orders. The order Hyeniales is now included in Pseudosporochnales.

Intact fossils of the Middle Devonian cladoxylopsid "Wattieza" show it was a tree, the earliest known in the fossil record as of 2007. In 2019, experts discovered more fossils of Cladoxylopsida and "Archaeopteris" in a quarry in Cairo, New York.

Crevasse

A crevasse is a deep crack, or fracture, found in an ice sheet or glacier. It is like a crevice that forms in rock. Crevasses form as a result of the movement caused by the shear stress between two semi-rigid pieces of ice.

Crevasses often have vertical or near-vertical walls, which can then melt and create seracs, arches, and other ice formations.

Surrender of Japan

The surrender of Imperial Japan was announced by Japanese Emperor Hirohito on August 15 and formally signed on September 2, 1945. This ended World War II.

Together with the British Empire and China, the United States called for the unconditional surrender of the Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945.

A key factor in Japan's surrender were the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Baltimore Plot

The Baltimore Plot was a plan by pro-slavery owners in late February 1861 to assassinate President-elect of the United States Abraham Lincoln. The plan was to kill Lincoln while he was on his way to his inauguration. 

Allan Pinkerton, founder of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, played a key role by being in charge of Lincoln's security throughout the journey. Though scholars debate whether or not the threat was real, clearly Lincoln and his advisors believed that there was a threat and took actions to make sure he traveled safely through Baltimore, Maryland. This was where Lincoln's plotted assassination would have happened.

Lincoln arrived secretly in Washington, D.C. on February 23, 1861. A planned train route through Bellaire, Ohio, to Wheeling, Virginia (West Virginia had yet to break off from Virginia) and eastward, was redirected up through the Pittsburgh through Pennsylvania, into Maryland and eventually to Washington.

For the remainder of his presidency, Lincoln's many critics would call him a coward because he was in disguise while travelling secretly to Washington.

Allan Pinkerton

Allan J. Pinkerton (August 25, 1819 – July 1, 1884) was a Scottish–American detective and spy. He was best known for creating the Pinkerton National Detective Agency.

Pinkerton's agents performed services ranging from security guarding to private military contracting work. 

The Pinkerton National Detective Agency hired women and minorities from its founding. Pinkerton was the largest private law enforcement organization in the world at the height of its power.

Ray tracing

Ray tracing is a computer algorithm for drawing very realistic 3D images.

With ray tracing, objects in the scene are described with geometrical shapes like spheres or planes. The computer then sends rays (straight lines) forward from where the camera is. The objects that get hit by these rays are the objects that the camera can see. The computer then draws these objects. This is similar to how our eyes see but in the real world the rays (light) go the opposite way – from the world to our eyes. If we made rays go from the world to the camera, most of the rays would not hit the camera, and we would have to wait a long time until we see an image appear. That is why instead, we make rays go from the camera to the world, meaning we know all the rays we create will go to the camera.

Ray Tracing was first mentioned by Albrecht Dürer in the XVI century. In 1982, Scott Roth called this technique "ray emission" in the computer graphics context, but in that time, it was a less accurate version of the Ray Tracing that didn't include reflection and refraction of light.

Crinkle crankle wall

A crinkle crankle wall is a brick wall built in alternate convex and concave curves. It is sometimes described as a serpentine wall or a wavy wall. It is found most often in England, though the idea has been used elsewhere. The walls do look elegant, but the main object is practical. The format resists the usual pushes from the surrounding earth, and so needs fewer repairs than straight walls do.

Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) incorporated serpentine walls into the architecture of the University of Virginia, which he founded. On both sides of its rotunda and down the length of the lawn are ten pavilions. Each has its own walled garden separated by crinkle crankle walls.

Many crinkle crankle walls are found in East Anglia, England. There the marshes of The Fens were drained by Dutch engineers, starting in the mid-1600s. They apparently introduced the idea.  The county of Suffolk has at least 50 examples, twice as many as in the rest of the country. The term "crinkle crankle" is said to derive from a Suffolk dialect. The crinkle crankle wall running from the former manor house to All Saints' Church in the estate village of Easton is believed to be the longest existing example.

The idea, which is never seen in cities, is not that uncommon in south-eastern England. The ancient village of Wheathampstead in Hertfordshire has a crinckle-crankle wall near its church. It has needed far less maintenance than the straight walls in the vicinity.

In Lymington, Hampshire, there are at least two examples of crinkle crankle walls. The older of the two is thought to have been constructed at the time of the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) by exiled Hanoverian soldiers living in a nearby house.

Crofting

Crofting is a form of land tenure. It also involves small-scale food production, particularly in the Scottish Highlands. Within the 19th century, townships, and individual crofts were established on the better land. Then a large area of poorer-quality hill ground was shared by all the crofters of the township for feeding their livestock.

Crofting is a traditional social system in Scotland defined by small-scale food production. It is a group of common working communities, or "townships". Individual crofts are typically established on of in-bye for better quality forage, arable and vegetable production. Each township manages poorer-quality hill ground as common grazing for cattle and sheep.

Despite its challenges, crofting is important to the Highlands. In 2014-15 there were 19,422 crofts, with 15,388 crofters. S

Tenants and owner-occupier crofters are required to comply with a range of duties specified in sections 5AA to 5C and 19C of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993. There is a requirement to be ordinarily resident within 32 km of the croft. If the croft is the sole dwelling and the crofter's family are resident while the croft is away this would probably be accepted as ordinarily resident. Other situations involving other places of residence would need to be assessed individually. In addition to the duty of residence tenants and owner occupier crofters are required to ensure the croft is cultivated, maintained and not neglected or misused.

Butrint

Butrint (; from ) was an ancient Greek and later Roman city and bishopric in Epirus. The city is considered as one of the most important archaeological sites in Albania. With its vast cultural, historical and natural value with a considerable history, Butrint became part of UNESCO World Heritage site in 1992. It became a National Park in 2000.

Buthrotum was a city of the Epirote tribe of the Chaonians. It started declining in Late Antiquity. It later became abandoned during the Middle Ages after a major earthquake flooded most of the city. 

It is now an archeological site in Vlorë County, Albania. It is about 14 kilometres south of Sarandë and close to the Greek border. It is located on a hill overlooking the Vivari Channel, and is part of the Butrint National Park.

The site of Butrint is accessible from Sarandë. Its road was first built in 1959 for a visit by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. The road was improved during the summer of 2010. 

The construction was somewhat of an environmental disaster. It one point, it threatened Butrint's World Heritage Site status. The ancient city is becoming a popular tourist destination. It attracts day-trippers from the nearby Greek holiday island of Corfu. Hydrofoils (30 minutes) and ferries (90 minutes) run daily between the New Port in Corfu Town and Saranda. 

Many visitors from Corfu use chartered coach services to visit Butrint from Sarandë. A regular public bus service runs between Sarandë port and Butrint. Others arrive from the Qafe Bote border crossing with Greece near Konispol and cross the Vivari Channel by the cable ferry at Butrint.





Pont Saint-Bénézet

The Pont Saint-Bénézet (; Provençal: "Pònt de Sant Beneset") is a famous medieval bridge in the town of Avignon, in the south of France. It is also known as the Pont d'Avignon ().

A wooden bridge was built between 1177 and 1185. It went across the Rhône river between Villeneuve-lès-Avignon and Avignon. This early bridge was destroyed forty years later in 1226. This was during the Albigensian Crusade when Louis VIII of France attacked Avignon. In 1234 building started again for a new bridge with 22 stone arches. The stone bridge was about long and only wide. This width included the parapets at the sides. The bridge was abandoned in the mid-17th century. The arches collapsed (broke and fell into the water) each time the Rhône flooded. This made it very expensive to maintain (fix) the bridge.

Four arches and the gatehouse at the Avignon end of the bridge still exist. The Chapel of Saint Nicholas sits on the second pier of the bridge. It was built in the second half of 12th century. It has changed a lot since then. The western terminus, the Tour Philippe-le-Bel also still exists.

The bridge was the inspiration for the French song "Sur le pont d'Avignon." The bridge is an important landmark in the city. In 1995, the arches of the bridge, together with the Palais des Papes and Cathédrale Notre-Dame des Doms were classified as a World Heritage Site.

The bridge went across the Rhône between Avignon and Villeneuve-lès-Avignon. The first bridge was built between 1177 and 1185. It was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. They started rebuilding the bridge again by 1234. Many historians think that the first bridge was made of wood or maybe a wooden structure supported on stone piers. When the bridge was built a second time, it was all made of stone. The stone bridge had 22 arches and 21 piers. Its length was . It did not run directly between the two gatehouses. It had a curved path. This was probably because of the position of the islands on the river at the time. Over the centuries the Rhône has moved across its floodplain. The position of the islands in the 13th century is not well documented. A 17th-century map shows that the southern end of the Île de la Barthelasse was upstream of the bridge. The bridge crossed small islands that were upstream of the Île de Piot. The space between the piers was between . The bridge was only in width with the parapets at the sides. The arches sometimes broke when the river flooded. They were sometimes replaced with temporary wooden structures, and after they were rebuilt in stone.

The bridge fell into a bad state during the 17th century. By 1644 the bridge was missing four arches. A flood in 1669 broke even more of the structure. After this, the other arches have collapsed one after the other, or they have been demolished. As of 2020, only four of the arches are left. The only other visible part of the bridge is some masonry from pier 11. This is attached to a private building on the Île de la Barthelasse. Remains of other piers are buried under a thick layer of sediment on the island or at the bottom of the Rhône. Piers 9 and 10 are both now on the Île de la Barthelasse. They were confirmed by cores drilled at the positions historians thought. They found masonry from the piers at a depth of below ground level. Just below the masonry, at a depth of around there were wooden fragments (small pieces). These were made of silver fir ("Abies alba"). Carbon-14 dating of this material gave dates of 1238–1301 AD for pier 9 and 1213–1280 AD for pier 10 (the range is for 2σ).

The arches are segmental rather than the semi-circular shape usually used in Roman bridges. Of the 4 arches that still exist, the largest span is . This is between the third and fourth piers. The piers have cutwaters. These are pointed both upstream and downstream. These mean there is less scour around the piers. This is one of the main problems for the stability of stone bridges. The piers were built with holes in the stone. This was to help lessen pressure from the flow of water when the river was in flood.

After the collapse of the Saint-Bénézet bridge, people crossed the Rhône at Avignon by ferry. This happened until the beginning of the 19th century. Between 1806 and 1818 a wooden bridge was built across the river. The new bridge was a few hundred metres south of the old bridge at the . A suspension bridge replaced the section across the Avignon branch of the Rhône in 1843. This was demolished in 1960 with the opening of the Edouard Daladier bridge. The section of the wooden bridge across the Villeneuve branch of the Rhône was not replaced until 1909. The replacement stone bridge, the Nouveau Pont, was damaged by bombing in 1944. It was repaired after the war but was replaced by the Pont du Royaume in 1972.

Saint Bénézet inspired the building of the bridge. He was a shepherd boy from the hamlet of Villard in the Ardèche. According to tradition, he heard the voice of Jesus Christ while he was looking after his sheep. Jesus asked him to build a bridge across the river. Although he was ridiculed at first, he "proved" his divine inspiration by miraculously lifting a very large block of stone. He won support for his project and formed a Bridge Brotherhood to help with building the bridge. After his death, he was interred on the bridge itself. This was in a small chapel standing on one of the bridge's surviving piers on the Avignon side.

The Saint Nicholas Chapel sits on a platform on the upstream side of the second pier (between the second and third arches). The bridge chapel has been restored and built again a few times. It now has two floors. Each floor has a nave and an apse. The upper floor is at the same level as the platform of the bridge. It makes the width of the walkway smaller. In this place, the walkway is only . There is a set of steps to get to the lower floor from the bridge.

The outside of the chapel shows marks of the rebuilding work. For example, there are blocked windows on the south-eastern wall. The nave is covered with stone roof tiles. These tiles rest on a series of corbels. The polygonal apse has a flat roof. It sits above the cutwater of the pier.

The lower chapel's apse is decorated with five arches. It is from the second half of the 12th century. At a later date, maybe as early as the 13th century, there was a floor supported by a ribbed quadripartite vault inserted into the structure. The simple rectangular upper chapel was consecrated in 1411. A side door was created in the lower chapel. This is because the stonework of the raised bridge blocked the original entrance. In 1513 a pentagonal apse with gothic columns was added to the upper chapel.

In 1670, after the bridge was abandoned, the relics of Saint Bénézet were transferred to the Hôpital du Pont (also called the Hôpital St Bénézet). This is within the city walls next to the gatehouse.

The bridge was also the site of devotion by the Rhône boatmen. This is because their patron saint was Saint Nicholas. They initially worshipped in the Saint Nicholas Chapel on the bridge itself (where Saint Bénézet's body was also interred). However, the bad condition of the bridge made it difficult to go there. In 1715 the confraternity of boatmen built a chapel on dry land on the Avignon side of the bridge. This was outside the ramparts next to the gatehouse. This chapel was destroyed by a major flood of the Rhône in 1856. A house for a caretaker was built on the ruins during the restoration work. This started around 1878. The residence was demolished after the restoration work on the bridge and gatehouse in the 1980s.
The bridge had great strategic importance. When it was built, it was the only fixed river crossing between Lyon and the Mediterranean Sea. It was also the only river crossing between the Comtat Venaissin (an enclave controlled by the Pope) and France controlled by the kings of France. As such, it was closely guarded on both sides of the river. The right bank was controlled by the French crown. The fortress of the Tour Philippe-le-Bel was close enough to see the bridge. This was built at the beginning of the 14th century. On the Avignon side, a large gatehouse was built in the 14th century. It was changed a lot in the 15th century. The walkway passed over the city wall and down a ramp (now destroyed). This led into the city.

Between 1265 and 1309 another stone bridge was built across the Rhône, . This was upstream from Avignon, at what is now Pont-Saint-Esprit. At the time, it was called Saint-Saturnin-du-Port. The Pont-Saint-Esprit bridge originally had 20 arches. It was long. Although it is now changed, the medieval bridge still exists as of 2020.

The Chapel of Saint Nicholas and the four remaining arches were listed as a "Monument historique" in 1840.

There has been a debate on whether there was a bridge before the Saint Bénézet bridge was built in the 12th century. Henri Revoil first said there may have been an older bridge. He said this at the French Archaeological Conference held in Avignon in 1882. His main argument was that the stonework at the base of the four surviving piers became visible. At very low water, stone blocks were visible. They were larger than those above. They had features that looked foreign to the existing bridge. The style of the masonry indicated to Revoil that there had been an earlier bridge dating from either the late Roman or Carolingian periods. In 1892 Louis Rochetin published an article. It said that the stone blocks at the base of the first pier and those on either side of the second pier supporting the chapel were the remains of springers that would have supported earlier Roman arches.

Denis-Marcel Marié self-published a book about the bridge in 1953. It looked at all the previous publications. In the last chapter it supported the hypothesis that there was an earlier bridge built by the Gallo-Romans around the end of the Roman occupation. He said that the bases of the piers that were still there belonged to this earlier bridge. He also said that the semi-circular arches used during the Roman period meant that the level of the roadway would have been higher than the top of the surviving chapel. Marié supposed that this early bridge had collapsed over the following seven centuries. He said that the 12th century Bénézet bridge had a decking supported on wooden piles linking the ruined Roman piers. The piles were needed because the gaps between the Roman stone piers would have been too large to span with wooden beams without the support in between. The height of the Bénézet bridge would have been at the level of the lower chapel.

Perrot "et al." published an article in 1971 about a Roman bridge too. The article talked about a survey in 1969 on the vestiges of the piers in the Villeneuve branch of the river the Compagnie Nationale du Rhône (CNR) destroyed them. The article also had long quotes from an unpublished report by Mr Mathian, an engineer working for the CNR. This was about a survey carried out in 1965 on the four intact piers on the Avignon side of the river. This survey found a layer of wood, at least 20 cm in thickness. This was under the foundations of each of the four intact piers.

A sample of the wood was dated by the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS). They used the radiocarbon technique. It was from between 290 and 530 AD, corresponding to the end of the Roman Empire. In the survey of the ruined piers in the Villeneuve channel, a pier (listed as number 14) was found to contain wooden beams inside the masonry. A sample of this wood was radiodated to 890 AD. During the dredging of the Villeneuve channel the remains of three large wooden piles were recovered. Two of these were still covered with iron tips.

The archaeologist Dominique Carru, accepted the radiocarbon date for the sample of wood. However, he argued in 1999 that it is very unlikely that an earlier bridge existed. It is not mentioned in the surviving texts from the high medieval period . Also, a bridge would have led to the development of a town on the right bank of the Rhône opposite Avignon, similar to those at other locations in the Rhône valley, such as Trinquetaille opposite Arles and Saint-Romain-en-Gal near Vienne. There is no evidence for an important early settlement near the terminus of the bridge. The main east-west route in the Roman period passed through Tarascon-Beaucaire, to the south. It avoided the river at Avignon which was wide and variable in position.

The bridge has became famous with the song "Sur le Pont d'Avignon" ("On the Bridge of Avignon"). An earlier song with the same title was popular in the 16th and 17th centuries. Ottaviano Petrucci published the melody in his "Harmonice Musices Odhecaton" of 1503-4. The 16th-century composer Pierre Certon used the melody in a mass with the title: "Sus le Pont d'Avignon". The modern version of the song dates from the mid-19th century. Adolphe Adam included it in the opéra comique "Le Sourd ou l'Auberge pleine." This was first played in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.




Belfries of Belgium and France

The Belfries of Belgium and France are a group of 56 historical buildings. They are part of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Europe. It shows a design change from feudal and religious influence in historic Flanders and its neighboring regions of the Duchy of Burgundy.

UNESCO included 32 towers of Belfries of Flanders and Wallonia in 1999. In 2005, the bell tower of Gembloux in the Walloon Region of Belgium and 23 others from the Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Picardy regions were added to the renamed list. Brussels Town Hall and its bell tower were not included since was already part of the Grand Place World Heritage Site.

Additional six church towers were also added since they served as watchtowers or alarm bell towers. These include Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp, St. Rumbolds Cathedral in Mechelen, St. Peter's Church, Leuven, St. Germanus Church in Tienen, the Basilica of Our Lady in Tongeren and St. Leonard's Church in Zoutleeuw.

Most of the buildings in the list are towers from bigger buildings. A few of them are restoration of towers previously connected to nearby bigger buildings.

Jeju language

The Jeju language (Jeju: 제주말, "Jeju-mal") is a Koreanic language spoken on the South Korean island of Jeju. It is related to Korean.

The Jeju language comes from Middle Korean, which is also the ancestor of the Korean language.

Jeju became a separate language from (mainland) Korean due to its isolation as an island and because in 1629, Jejuans were banned from leaving Jeju, causing more disconnection.

UNESCO lists Jeju as a "critically endangered" language, since most of its speakers are over the age of 70. Younger Jejuans speak Korean instead. As of 2010, the language is spoken by 5,000 - 10,000 people, which is less than 2% of Jeju Island's total population.

Many linguists think Jeju is its own language, mostly because mainland Koreans cannot understand it. Others think Jeju is a dialect of Korean, although a very different one. The local government calls Jeju as a separate language, and the idea of it being a language is becoming more accepted in both Korean and foreign academia. UNESCO listed Jeju as one of the world's languages in 2011.


Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong

Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong are a group of archaeological sites in North Korea that show the history of the Koryo Dynasty, which ruled Korea from 918 c.e. to 1392 c.e. All together, they were named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013.

Kaesong was the capital city of the Kingdom of Koryo. The city's gates, palaces, tombs and monuments, walls, schools, tower for looking at the stars and other buildings all together make up the World Heritage Site because they show the philosophy, culture, politics and spiritual beliefs of the Koryo people. The city's layout shows a mixture of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. It especially shows the change from Buddhism to neo-Confucianism that happened during the Koryo Dynasty.

UNESCO says three different sections of wall and a few gates in Kaesong have enough historical value to be part of the site. The Palocham Wall was built in 896 c.e., just before the Koryo Dynasty. The Outer Wall was built in 1009-1029 and connected the city to the nearby Songak, Puhung, Tokam, Jine and Ryongsu Mountains. The wall was built to defend the city, but it also shows what people believed about the magic or spiritual power of mountains. The Inner Wall was built in 1391-3, just as the Koryo Dynasty was ending.

The Namdae Gate in the Inner Wall was the main gate on the south side of Kaesong.

Manwoldae Palace is now an archaeological site. It was the royal palace for 500 years. It burned down four times and the people rebuilt it over and over. In modern times, North Korean and South Korean teams have worked at the site together to study it. 

The ruins of the Kaesong Chomsongdae are also part of the site.. Comsongdae was an observatory where people studied the stars and weather. The Koryo Songgyungwan was a school for government officials and Sungyang Sowon was a school of Confucian philosophy.

Sonjuk Bridge is where the high official Jong Mong Ju was assassinated, an event that was part of the end of the Koryo Dynasty.

The Heritage Site includes large mausoleums for King Taejo of Goryeo and King Gongmin of Goryeo. It has two other groups of tombs as well, the Seven Tombs Cluster and Myongrung Tombs Cluster. There are also two steles for Jeong Mong-ju, called the Phyochung Monuments. Steles are memorial pillars that may have the dead person's name written on them but do not contain his or her body.

List of World Heritage Sites in North Korea

As of 2013, two sites in North Korea have been added to the World Heritage List. Both are cultural sites. There are also five sites on the tentative list.


Chiappa Rhino

The Chiappa Rhino is a revolver. It fires bullets from the bottom of the cylinder. This is different from most other revolvers, which fire from the top of the cylinder. This allows the Rhino to shoot even powerful bullets, like the .357 Magnum, with little recoil. As a result, the Rhino also has high accuracy and high rate of fire.

The Rhino is named after the rhinoceros because it looks somewhat like a rhinoceros's head. Most models shoot the .357 Magnum (as well as the .38 Special), but there are also models that shoot the 9x19mm Parabellum or the S&W .40. Due to its futuristic look, it is often shown in science-fiction movies like the live-action "Ghost in the Shell", "", and the remake of "Total Recall".

USS Enterprise (CVN-80)

USS "Enterprise" (CVN-80) will be the third to be built for the United States Navy. She will be the ninth United States naval vessel to bear the name, and is scheduled to be in operation by 2027. Her construction began in August 2017 with a steel-cutting ceremony.

On 1 December 2012, during the presentation of a pre-recorded speech at the inactivation ceremony for , then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that CVN-80 would be named "Enterprise". She will be the ninth ship and the third aircraft carrier in the history of the United States Navy to bear the name. CVN-80 will also be the first American supercarrier not to be named in honor of a person since the was commissioned in 1966. In December 2016, Mabus chose Olympic gold medalists Katie Ledecky and Simone Biles to sponsor the ship.

CVN-80 will be built by Huntington Ingalls Industries-Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia. "Enterprise" is scheduled to begin active construction around 2018 and be delivered by 2025. However, in an effort to save costs, the Congressional Research Service indicates that the Department of the Navy is reviewing the possibility of extending the length of time used to build both and "Enterprise" by two years. If approved, the ship would not enter service until 2027 and prevent any instance of 12 carriers being in service at any one time. The steel from CVN-65 will be recycled and used to construct CVN-80. The ship is currently scheduled to replace . The first cut of steel ceremony, marking the beginning of fabrication of the ship's components, was held on 21 August 2017, with ship's sponsors Katie Ledecky and Simone Biles present. Construction began in advance of the purchase contract and construction award, in early 2018. In the spring of 2018, a piece of steel from CVN-65 was melted down and remade into a keel plate for CVN-80.

Jongmyo

Jongmyo Shrine is a religious building in Seoul, South Korea. It is a Confucian royal shrine from the Joseon Dynasty. It was built in the late 1300s, destroyed during a Japanese invasion in the 1500s, and rebuilt in the 1600s. People still use it in modern times.

The Jongmyo Shrine holds spirit tablets, each dedicated to a specific king or queen from the Joseon Dynasty. The Confucian way of life includes ancestor worship. During the Joseon Dynasty, the king of Korea would go to Jongmyo to pray to earlier kings and queens. There were also larger rites, with more people. Some of them involved singing and dancing. Some of these rites are still performed in modern times.

The layout of the shrine was planned very carefully to complement and work with the hills and other natural structures around it. 

Jongmyo has a main shrine, called Jeongjeon. It has a smaller shrine called Yeongnyeongjeon, or "the Hall of Eternal Peace" in English. It also has a place specifically for the king, a storage building for ritual items, and a waiting area. There is also a specific shrine to King Kongmin from the earlier Koryo Dynasty. That shrine was built by the Joseon-era King Taejo.

The Jongmyo-Daejae, or "Royal Shrine Ritual" in English, was the most important rite performed at the shrine. During the Joseon Dynasty, it was performed five times each year. During the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945), it was not performed because the Japanese did not allow it. Since 1969, the Royal Family Association has performed the Jongmyo-Daejae once each year. The Jongmyo-Daejae itself and the music used in the Jongmyo-Daejae were both declared Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in 2001.

Jongmyo was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995.

Echo sounding

Echo sounding is a way out measure the depth of water. This is done by sending out sound waves, and measuring how long it takes for the echo of the sound to come back. The speed of sound in the water is known, so the depth can be calculated. It is a kind of sonar. Note that the word sounding is used for all kinds of technologies, even though some do not use sound. Before echo sounding was used (in the early 20th century), sounding lines were lowered into the water to measure the depth.

The sound reflects off the seafloor and returns to the transducer. The time the sound takes to travel to the bottom and back is used to calculate the distance to the seafloor. Water depth is estimated by using the speed of sound through the water (approximately 1,500 meters per second). The product is divided by two because the measured time is the round-trip time (from the transducer to the seafloor and back to the transducer). The faster the sound pulses return to the transducer from the ocean floor, the shallower the water depth is and the higher the elevation of the sea floor. The sound pulses are sent out regularly as the ship moves along the surface, which produces a line showing the depth of the ocean beneath the ship. This continuous depth data is used to create bathymetry maps of the survey area.

Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes

Jeju Volcanic Island and lava tubes are located off the coast of South Korea. They are in Jeju Province. Jeju has Mount Halla, a shield volcano located over a volcanic hotspot with many parasitic volcanoes, called oreums, around it. According to UNESCO, the Geomunoreum lava caves are "the finest lava tube system of caves anywhere." UNESCO named Jeju Volcanic Island a Biosphere Reserve in 2002, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007, and a Global Geopark in 2010. It is the only island in the world with three UNESCO designations.

Jeju Volcanic Island started to form 1.8 million years ago when the volcano was still active.

According to UNESCO, the three important things that make Jeju Volcanic Island and lava caves a World Heritage site are the Geomonoreum lava cages, Seongsang Ilchulbong, and Hallasan.

The Geomunoreum lava caves are covered in many-colored carbonate deposits on the roof and floor. They formed about 300,000 years ago when magma from the Geomonoreum parasitic volcano cooled.

The Seongsan Ilchulbong tuff cone rises straight out of the ocean. It formed between 50,000 and 120,000 years ago from underwater volcanic activity. It is 180 meters tall. Because it is surrounded by cliffs and sharp rocks, many people think it looks like a fortress.

Hallasan, or Mount Halla, also called Yeongjusan Mountain, is Korea's tallest mountain, 1950 meters. It has not been an active volcano for 1000 years. It has many rock formations, a crater lake full of islands, and many cliffs and waterfalls. Over 1800 types of plants live on the mountain and 4000 types of animals, including 3300 species of insects.

Other parts of Jeju Volcanic Island are considered important by the government of South Korea but not UNESCO. For example, Bijarim Forest, which is on Mount Halla, is Natural Monument No. 374.

Jeju Volcanic Island is a popular tourist destination in South Korea, with 14.4 million visitors in 2019 alone. Environmentalists say they make 20,000 tons of garbage each year. Environmentalists and scientists have said that the government has cut down too much of Jeju's forests to make roads, buildings, resorts and golf courses for visitors. In 2020, environmentalists protested plans to build a second airport on the island. Among other problems, this airport would need a road through Bijarim Forest. This is a forest of nutmeg trees, some of them 800 years old. It is the only place in the world where nutmeg trees grow so closely together.

In 2008, Jeju Volcanic Island and Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park became sister parks.

Grand-Pré National Historic Site

Grand-Pré National Historic Site is a park set to honour the Grand-Pré area of Nova Scotia. Grand-Pré is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the main site of the two National Historic Sites of Canada. 

It was the centre of Acadian settlement from 1682 to 1755. It honours the memory of the deportation of the Acadians that happened during the French and Indian War. The original village of Grand Pré is four kilometres along the ridge between present-day Wolfville and Hortonville.

Grand-Pré (French for "great meadow") is located on the shore of the Minas Basin. It was an area of tidal marshland. The first people who lived in the area in 1680 were Pierre Melanson dit Laverdure and his wife Marguerite Mius d'Entremont. They had five young children. They came from the nearby Port-Royal. It was the first capital of the French settlement of Acadia ("Acadie" in French).

Pierre Melanson and other Acadians who joined him in Grand-Pré built dykes there to hold back the tides along the Minas Basin. They made rich pastures for their animals and fertile fields for their crops. Grand-Pré became the bread basket of Acadia. It soon outgrew Port-Royal. By the mid-18th century, it was the largest of the numerous Acadian communities around the Bay of Fundy and the coastline of Nova Scotia (Latin for "New Scotland").

The "Landscape of Grand Pré" was added to Canada's tentative list of potential World Heritage Sites in 2004. By June 20, 2012, it became part of the World Heritage Sites by UNESCO It has of polderised marshland. Its archaeological sites were recognized as an "exceptional example of the adaptation of the first European settlers to the conditions of the North American Atlantic coast" and as "a memorial to Acadian way of life and deportation".

On the 300th anniversary of the arrival of the first Acadians in the region in 1682, the Grand-Pré memorial park was designated the "Grand-Pré National Historic Site of Canada" in commemoration of the settlement, and later deportation of the Acadians. In 1995, the site and its surrounding regions were assigned the "Grand-Pré Rural Historic District National Historic Site of Canada". It was given in honour of the rural cultural landscape which features one of the oldest land occupation and use patterns of European origin in Canada.

The "Grand Pré Heritage Conservation District" was chosen under the provincial Heritage Property Act in 1999. It includes the area in and around the hamlet of Grand-Pré, as well as the Grand-Pré National Historic Site of Canada.


Cairngorms

The Cairngorms (Scottish Gaelic: "Am Monadh Ruadh") is a group of mountains in the eastern part of Highlands of Scotland. It is usually linked with the mountain of the Cairn Gorm. The Cairngorms became part of Scotland's second national park (the Cairngorms National Park) on 1 September 2003. It was part of the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. 

The Cairgorms, Angus Glens, Monadhliath, and lower areas of Strathspey, make up the Cairngorms National Park.

The Cairngorms is made of high plateau that is about 1000–1200 m above sea level. They have domed summits that that are around 1300 m. high. Many of the summits have tors. These are basically free-standing rock formations that stand on top of the rocky landscape. 

The edges of the plateau that have narrow cliffs of granite. It makes it ideal for skiing, rock climbing and ice climbing. 

The area is home to birds such as ptarmigan, dotterel, snow bunting, curlew and red grouse, as well as mammals such as mountain hare. 

The plateau is also home to Britain's only herd of reindeer. Next to the central massif are the remainders of the Caledonian forest. These forests support many species that are not found anywhere elsewhere in the United Kingdom. These include red squirrels, pine marten, wood ants, Scottish crossbill, capercaillie and crested tit.

There are no glaciers in the area. However, snow can fall at any month of the year. In fact, some snow may be found all summer. It is the most ideal place for ice climbing in Britain. 

The mountains are also popular for hill-walking, ski touring and climbing. There are also three alpine ski centres within the area: Cairn Gorm, The Lecht and Glenshee.

The range lies in the Scottish council areas of Aberdeenshire, Moray and Highland, and within the counties of Aberdeenshire, Invernessshire and Banffshire.

The original Gaelic name for the area is "Am Monadh Ruadh", (the red hills). It is different from "Am Monadh Liath" (the grey hills) which lie to the west of the River Spey:

The English language name for the area is Cairngorms. It came from Cairn Gorm. It is the prominent in the view of the mountains from Speyside. The earliest time when the name appeared in the history is from a Colonel T. Thornton who visited the area in about 1786:

Cairn Gorm means "Blue Cairn. A"lthough the Gaelic "gorm" can also be used as an adjective and verb. It means green or greening, and is often seen in connection with growing grass.

Fall Guys is a battle royale game, developed by Mediatonic and published by Devolver Digital. The gameplay for Fall Guys was inspired by the 1980s gameshow "Takeshi's Castle". In "Fall Guys", up to 60 players in a match compete to win each round. Players must survive each round by completing the goals of each round. The winner of the match is the last player standing. The game had experienced a rise in popularity in the summer of 2020 because it was given attention by Twitch streamers and PewDiePie.

In "Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout", the main gameplay comes from playing a series of mini-games in the game. Most mini-games are categorized into four major categories: races, survival, hunting, and logic. The only exception is for "finals", which are basically variations of some of the main mini-games. Most mini-games feature obstacles that block the progress of other players. Certain mini-games include elements of teamwork.

The goal is to race to the finish line. Only around two-thirds of the participants can qualify. When the last qualifiable player passes the finish line, all remaining players are eliminated.

These are the current races as of December 2020:



In these rounds, players must stay alive until the timer runs out, or all activities have been completed:



These rounds have you focusing and hunting down other players for tails or hoops, etc:


These levels are a lower category and mistaken for Survival levels, the biggest differences are that your brain is key, not reflex:


Players are divided equally (where possible) into teams. Each game has a certain, unchanging number of teams. All games with two teams will be Blue and Yellow. Games with a third team will introduce Red. Games with a fourth team will introduce Green:


When enough players have been eliminated and only a few remain, the final round will be played. Whoever wins these games will be crowned the overall winner of the show.

Every few months, Fall Guys regularly hosts a new season. Each season hosts a new theme and comes with additional content.

Death of Ms Dhu

Julieka Ivanna Dhu (December 26, 1991 — August 4, 2014) (usually called Ms Dhu out of respect for Aboriginal customs) was an Aboriginal Australian woman who died in police custody on 4 August 2014.

She was put in jail for not paying fines. She complained about pain and was sent to hospital, but staff there believed she was suffering from the effects of drugs. She was returned to prison and then sent back to hospital about complaining about not being able to stand. It turned out that she died from an infection caused by a rib that was broken before she was arrested.

A lot of people in Australia were sad about Ms Dhu's death. They thought she died because the police and hospital staff were being racist to her.

Ms Dhu was born on 26 December 1991 in Western Australia. She was of the Yamatji people. She was "cheerful" as a child and didn't have a lot of serious health problems. Dhu completed Year Eleven; but her family said that after not completing school, her friends were "bad" and that she was a "wild child".

In November 2009, when she was 17, police found Dhu sleeping near Cable Beach; when they woke her up, she seemed to be intoxicated, used bad language at them, and said "I don't remember anything after taking that eccy". The police arrested her for her behaviour and for not telling the police her name and address, keeping her in jail for one night. They let her go the next morning on bail, but she did not come to Court when the police case against her was held, and the court said she had to pay the police $200 as punishment. The next year, Dhu got in some small troubles with the police after she moved back to Port Hedland. Once, she kicked a female police officer while being put under police control for Dhu's behaviour. The court again said she had to pay the police money as punishment.

In 2013, when Dhu was 21 years old, her boyfriend was a 42 year old man, Dion Ruffin, who Dhu did not know did violent acts against his girlfriends.

Ms Dhu's partner was abusing her, so she called the police for help. Instead, they arrested both of them. She had a warrant for her arrest due to unpaid fines that came from three arrests when she was a teenager.

Ms Dhu said that she could not stand. The officers thought she was out of her mind and called her names like "junkie". Dhu fell and the officers let her fall to the ground and hit her head. They got tired of her and so sent her to hospital. When they got there, the officers told the nurses that Dhu was acting.

53 minutes after Ms Dhu arrived at hospital, she was pronounced dead.

Royal Tombs of the Joseon dynasty

The Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty are a group of burial sites in Seoul, South Korea. Some of them are in other parts of WHICH Province. They were built for the rulers of the Joseon Dynasty and their families. They were named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009.

The tombs show Confucian philosophy. The location of each tomb was chosen carefully. Most tombs have a hillside behind them and face a body of water. Many of them have mountains visible in the background. Many of the tombs have statues, burial mounds, shrines for ancestor worship and buildings for guards and groundskeepers.

The oldest tomb was built in 1408 and the newest in 1966.

Unlike royal tombs in many other parts of the world, the Joseon Royal Tombs have not been robbed by grave robbers. Whenever archaeologists examined a grave, they found the dead man or woman still had a crown, gold, jewels, or other valuable grave goods. As far as scholars can tell, the only people to ever dig up Joseon Royal Tombs were modern archaeologists, starting in 1930 during the Japanese occupation of Korea. That team was careful to treat the tomb with respect so that the people of Korea would not become angry. Scholars know which king or queen was buried in some tombs and do not know which king or queen was buried in other tombs. Archaeologists only dig up tombs whose owner is not known.

Treble (association football)

A treble in association football is when a club team wins three trophies in a single season. A "continental treble" is when a clubs wins the national league competition, the main national cup competition and the main continental trophy. A "domestic treble" is when a clubs wins three national competitions. Usually this means the league title, the main cup competition and one secondary competition.

This list has clubs who have won their country's highest level league and the primary cup competition (the double), as well as the main continental tournament, all in the same season. Celtic was the first club to do this in 1967. They won the Scottish Football League, Scottish Cup, and European Cup. They also won the Scottish League Cup that year. This makes them the only team in history to win the domestic treble and the European Cup in the same season (although most European nations do not have a League Cup).

In men's football, seven European clubs have achieved the treble since 1967. FC Barcelona and Fc Bayern are the only clubs to win this treble twice. Cruz Azul is the only Mexican team to win a continental treble. It has done this twice, in 1969 and 1997.

No South American team has achieved the treble. This is because many countries there do not (or did not) have a major knockout cup. The Copa do Brasil only began in 1989, and the Copa Argentina began in 2011. Uruguay still does not have a knockout cup.

Bruno Fernandes

Bruno Miguel Borges Fernandes (born 8 September 1994 in Maia, Porto) is a Portuguese professional footballer. He plays as a midfielder for club Manchester United and for the Portugal national team.

He has previously played in Italy for Novara, Udinese, and Sampdoria, as well as in Portugal with Sporting CP. He was named Primeira Liga Player of the Year in both 2018 and 2019. In January 2020, Manchester United signed him for an initial fee of €55 million (£47 million).

Fernandes made his senior debut for Portugal in November 2017. He had previously played for Portugal's under-19s, under-20s and under-21s. He also played for Portugal at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Fernandes was born in Maia, Metropolitan Area of Porto. He played most of his youth football with local club Boavista FC. On 27 August 2012, he went to play for Novara Calcio in Italy.

After only a few weeks with the youth side, Fernandes started to play to the first team in Serie B. He played in just over half of the league games during the 2012–13 season. He helped his team to fifth place and the promotion play-offs.

In summer 2013, Fernandes signed for Udinese Calcio in a co-ownership deal. He made his debut in Serie A on 3 November. He came on as a second-half substitute. Udinese lost 0–3 at home against Inter Milan.

Fernandes scored his first league goal on 7 December 2013. This was in a 3–3 draw at S.S.C. Napoli. He scored again in the second match between the sides (a 1–1 draw).

On 15 May 2018, Fernandes and several of his teammates and coaches were injured following an attack by around 50 Sporting supporters at the club's training ground. This was after the team finished third in the league and did not get to the Champions League qualification stage. Despite this, the team still played in the final of the Taça de Portugal the weekend after. Sporting lost against C.D. Aves.

Fernandes was named the Primeira Liga Player of the Year on 6 July 2018. Four days later he signed a new five-year contract with a €100 million release clause.

He scored seven goals in his first 10 appearances of the 2019–20 season. This included scoring in six matches in a row. This made him the third Sporting player in the 21st century to score in six or more matches in a row, after Mário Jardel and Bas Dost. On 28 November 2019, he scored twice and assisted the other two goals in a 4–0 win against PSV Eindhoven. This made sure Sporting qualified for the knockout stages of the UEFA Europa League.

On 29 January 2020, English club Manchester United agreed with Sporting to buy Fernandes. This was for a fee of up to €80 million (£67.6 million). Fernandes also needed to pass a medical and agree personal terms. The transfer was officially done the day after. The initial fee is around €55 million (£47 million), and up to €25 million (£21 million) in add-ons. Sporting will also get 10% of the profits if United ever sell Fernandes.

He scored his first goal for Manchester United against Watford on 23 February. This was a penalty in a 3–0 victory at Old Trafford. In this match, he also made an assist for the third goal scored by Mason Greenwood. His first European goal for the club was in the second leg of their UEFA Europa League round of 32 tie against Club Brugge at Old Trafford. Fernandes scored a penalty. This helped Manchester United to win 5–0. On 16 March 2020, Fernandes was voted as the Premier League Player of the Month for February. On 30 June 2020, Fernandes scored his first brace (two goals in one match) for the club in a 3–0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion. In June 2020, he won awards for the club and in the Premier League. This included winning the Premier League Player of the Month and Goal of the Month. He became the first player to win both awards at the same time in the Premier League. He also became the first Manchester United player to win the Premier League Player of the Month award two months in a row since Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2006–07 season. Bruno Fernandes has scored 8 goals and assisted 7 times in 14 games in his Premier League first season with Manchester United.

Fernandes has played for Portugal at five levels. Before he played in the senior team (the main Portugal team), he was captain of the under-21 team.

Fernandes played for Portugal in the 2016 Summer Olympics. He started every game, as Portuagl reached the quarter-finals.

When he played in Italy, he did not play for Portugal. He was called up for the national team on 28 August 2017. He took the place of Pizzi because he was injured. This was for World Cup qualifiers against the Faroe Islands and Hungary.

Fernandes won his first full cap on 10 November 2017. He came on in place of Manuel Fernandes for the last 34 minutes of the 3–0 friendly win over Saudi Arabia. Fernando Santos chose him in his team for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. He scored his first national team goal on 7 June.

Fernandes' first World Cup game was on 15 June 2018. He played 66 minutes in a 3–3 group stage draw against Spain.

Fernandes is an attacking midfielder. He is a direct, energetic playmaker. He can take on defenders and also set the rhythm of play. Because he is direct, Fernandes sometimes takes risks. He tries difficult passes to create chances of scoring goals.He often presses the opposition quickly after losing possession. In addition, he is a a good free-kick taker. He likes to shoot from outside the penalty area. His movement off the ball is also important, as he looks to find space to create chances. Fernandes can also play in a deeper central midfield role, or as a second striker.

Ranoidea (genus)

Ranoidea is a genus of frogs in the subfamily Pelodryadinae. They live in Australia, New Guinea, the Maluku Islands, and the Louisiade Archipelago. Scientists still disagree with each other about whether "Ranoidea" should be its own genus or not and which frogs should be in it. Many of the frogs in "Ranoidea" used to be in "Litoria", "Dryopsophus", or "Hyla". In 2016, one team of scientists wrote a paper saying "Litoria" should be divided up into other genuses. Many other amphibian scientists read it and agreed, but some did not. One reason for this was that not all of the frogs in "Litoria" had been studied on the DNA level.

All frogs in "Ranoidea" have side-to-side pupils that open up-and-down and no coloring in their eyelid membrane. Many species have tadpoles that swim in mountain streams and have very large mouths on the undersides of their bodies.

The following species are or were recognized in the genus "Ranoidea":
Scientists also think the Papua big-eyed tree frog might be in "Ranoidea" but they want to collect more data about where the frog lives first.

Ranoidea

The Ranoidea are a superfamily of frogs in the order Anura. These frogs have a fused pectoral girdle bone in their chests, no ribs, and the males hold on to the female with an axillary grip during mating. The tadpoles have a single spiracle on the left side and complex mouthparts. Some species do not have tadpoles, and small frogs grow straight from eggs. Scientists disagree about exactly which frogs should be placed in which family and on exactly where Ranoidea belongs among groups of amphibians. Amphibian scientists often change their minds about exactly which frogs are related to each other and how closely, usually when someone finds new information (Glaw,Vences, 2001).

This superfamily contains seventeen different families, each containing at least 2 species (some contain over 300 different species).

These families are copied from and 

The family of Ranixalidae (Leaping Frogs) has one genus containing 10 different species. They live in central and southern India. They live in leaf litter and in tropical deciduous forests, near streams and can be found between 200 m and 1100 m above sea level.

The family of Mantellidae (Malagasy Poison Frogs) has 3 different genera with 191 species total. They live in Madagascar and Mayotte Island. They are both terrestrial and tree frogs and live between 800 and 1000 m above sea level.

The family of Rhacophoridae (Afroasian Tree Frogs) has two subfamilies, 14 genera, and a total of 321 species. They live in Sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, and South Asia. They are mainly tree frogs.
The family of Pyxicephalidae (African Bullfrogs) has two subfamilies, 13 genera, and 68 total species. They live in Sub-Saharan Africa. The two subfamilies are completely different. Cacosternine frogs are small and slender and live on the ground or in and out of water. Pyxicephaline frogs are large bullfrog-like frogs with thick bodies and fanglike bones on their lower jaws, used to smash their prey.

The family of Petropedetidae (African Water Frogs and Goliath Frog) has two genera with a total of 18 different species. They live in Sub-Saharan Africa. This family contains the world's largest living frog, the "Conraua goliath."

The family of Ptychadenidae (Grassland Frogs) has 3 genera with a total of 53 different species. They live in sub-Saharan Africa. They live in grasslands and savannas. They have slender bodies with long arms and legs.

The family of Ceratobatrachidae (Triangle Frogs) has 5 genera with a total of 84 different species. They live in Malaysia, the Philippines, Borneo, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. Most have very angular bodies and are small to medium-sized. They live in the forests.

The family of Brevicipitidae (Rain frogs) has 5 genera with 31 total species. They live in the southeast corner of Africa. They are typically small with round shaped bodies, which become even more round when they are disturbed because they inflate themselves.

Eclectus parrot

The eclectus parrot ("Eclectus roratus") is a parrot that lives in the Solomon Islands, Sumba, New Guinea and nearby islands, northeastern Australia, and the Maluku Islands (Moluccas). The parrot is about 35 cm (14 in) long. 

The male is mostly bright green with a yellow-tinge on the head. It has blue flight feathers, and red flanks and underwing coverts. Its tail is creamy yellow, and is dark grey edged with creamy yellow underneath. The tail feathers are green and blue. The upper beak of the adult male is orange.

The female is mostly bright red with a darker hue on the back and wings. The mantle and underwing coverts darken to a more purple in colour. The tail is edged with yellowish-orange above, and is more orange tipped with yellow underneath. The beak of the adult female is all black. The upper beak of the young ones are brown and yellow.

The colours are interesting because they are the reverse of normal. In most birds the females are "self-coloured" (all one colour, and usually quite dull). Males, who compete for females, are usually brightly coloured. The essential idea is that the female should be dull or camouflaged because she carries the "precious package", the eggs. Parrots are often native to tropical forests, where green is camouflage. The males, on the other hand, need to signal their excellent health and general fitness. An extreme case would be the Twelve-wired bird-of-paradise. The implication of colouring in the "Eclectus" must be that the selection pressure is somehow different from that experienced by most bird species.

The birds eats fruits, wild figs, unripe nuts, flower and leaf buds, and some seeds. In captivity, they mostly eat fruit. 

The eclectus has an unusually long digestive tract, so it tolerates food with lots of fiber. In captivity, the eclectus parrot benefits from specially made pellets, fruits, vegetables, and a small amount of seeds and nuts such as almonds and walnuts.

In its natural habitat, the eclectus parrot builds its nests in holes in large rainforest trees. Males may travel up to 20 km to find food. Eclectus parrots are polygynandrous, which means that females may mate with different males, and males may travel from nest to nest to mate with females.

Two white eggs are laid. They are incubated for 28–30 days. Young fledge at about 11 weeks. Although eclectus parrots usually reach sexual maturity between 2–3 years.

Eclectus hens have a strong maternal instinct, which is shown in captivity. It is often possible to place abandoned eggs from other types of parrot under a female eclectus hen, which she will always accept. She will then incubate the egg until it hatches. She will even raise the chick until it grows big enough to leave the nest.

Eclectus parrots are one of the popular birds kept in captivity. Unlike many other types of parrot they are easy to breed but are difficult to feed with the hand. Eclectus parrots are generally calm birds in captivity.

The average lifespan of the eclectus parrots in captivity is not known, because these birds are not kept in captivity in big numbers until the 1980s. Some sources say that the lifespan is 30 years.

Toothpick

A toothpick is a small thin stick of wood, plastic, bamboo, metal, bone or other material. It has at least one and sometimes two pointed ends. The first mention and patent for it was in February 1872. A person can push a toothpick between their teeth to remove very small pieces of food, after a meal. Toothpicks are also used for celebrations to hold or stick small appetizers (like cheese cubes or olives). 

Toothpicks sometimes have plastic frills or look like small paper umbrellas or flags.

The toothpick is the oldest tool for cleaning teeth. The skulls of Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, show clear signs of teeth picked with a tool. Toothpicks that are made of bronze have been found in prehistoric graves in Northern Italy and in the East Alps.

There are artistic toothpicks made of silver in antiquity, as well as from mastic wood.
In the 17th century, toothpicks were luxury objects. They were made using precious metal and set with expensive stones.

The first toothpick-manufacturing machine was developed by Marc Signorello in 1869. Another was patented in 1872, by Silas Noble and J. P. Cooley.

Wooden toothpicks are cut from birch wood. Logs are first cut into thin sheets, which are then cut, chopped, milled and bleached into each toothpicks. Plastic toothpicks, also called dental pics, are still made in America in Georgia, by Armond's Manufacturing. Nowadays other ways of keeping include using dental floss, toothbrushes, and oral irrigators.

Representative Albert Jan Verbeek had the idea to create a national library. He suggested this on August 17, 1798. The basis of the collection would be William V's confiscated book collection. The library was officially founded as the "Nationale Bibliotheek" on November 8 1798. This was after a group of representatives gave advice for the creation of a national library on the same day. At first, the National Library was only open to members of the Representative Body.

King Louis Bonaparte (the brother of Napoleon Bonaparte) gave called the national library the Royal Library in 1806. Napoleon Bonaparte transferred the Royal Library to The Hague as property, while also allowing the Imperial Library in Paris to expropriate publications from the Royal Library. In 1815 King William I of the Netherlands confirmed the name of 'Royal Library' (Dutch: Koninklijke Bibliotheek) by royal resolution. It has been known as the National Library of the Netherlands since 1982, when it opened new quarters. The institution became 'Independent Administrative Body' of the state in 1996, although it is financed by the Department of Education, Culture and Science.

The humanities are central to the collection of the KB, with an emphasis on Dutch history, language and culture.

In 2016, the KB contained 7,000,000 items, equivalent to 115 kilometers of bookshelves. Most items in the collection are books. There are also pieces of "grey literature", where the author, publisher, or date may not be apparent but the document has cultural or intellectual significance. The collection contains almost the entire literature of the Netherlands, from medieval manuscripts to modern scientific publications. As there was no law for depositing Dutch publication the library started on January 1 1974 the voluntary . This in contrast with most other countries that have a legal deposit of publications. For a publication to be accepted, it must be from a registered Dutch publisher. 

The collection is accessible for members. Any person aged 16 years or older can become a member. One day passes are also available. Requests for material take approximately 30 minutes. The KB hosts several open access websites, including the "Memory of the Netherlands" ("Geheugen van Nederland"), Digital Library for Dutch Literature and Delpher, an archive of more than 100 million pages as of 2020.

The Literature museum (in Dutch: Literatuurmuseum) was founded in 1750 as Nederlands Letterkundig Museum, The museum contains a large collection of letters, manuscripts and memorabilia. The museum has three permanent and several temporary exhibitions. It also contains a special children's book museum. On 4 February 2016, an online museum was opened. On 1 November 2016, the museum was renamed to Literature museum. The museum has a reading room with an extensive collection of newspaper clipping, and under certain conditions, some archival material can be consulted.

The KB's Research Department is engaged in internationally renowned research in the field of digital technology, sustainable preservation and accessibility of both paper and digital heritage. Important topics are the applicability of artificial intelligence, the use of big data, the increasing importance of privacy & security, the changes in the publishing and publishing world and the role of public libraries in today's society.

MacGuffin

In fiction, a MacGuffin is an object, detail, or event in the story that is important to the plot or the motivation of the story's characters. The term was first used by filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock. He was not the first to use or discover the trope, but he is given credit for coming up with the name. Other filmmakers like George Lucas used the term MacGuffin as well, but their definition was somewhat different from Hitchcock's. Nevertheless, details about MacGuffins below will describe Hitchcock's point of view.

According to Hitchcock, the MacGuffin has no importance other than moving the story forward, and it has no meaning by itself. It does not matter what the "thing" the characters want is, as long as it drives the character or moves the plot forward. In other words, any detail of a story is a MacGuffin if it can be replaced by something else without changing the rest of the story. If changing what the "thing" the characters want changes anything else in the story, then it is not a MacGuffin.

An example of a MacGuffin is Marsellus Wallace's briefcase in the movie "Pulp Fiction". Getting the suitcase and giving it back to Marsellus Wallace is the reason why Wallace's hit men are willing to kill other people and risk their lives to keep it, but what is inside the briefcase is never shown or explained. According to the movie's writer and director Quentin Tarantino, he says that whatever is in the briefcase is whatever the audience wants it to be, because such knowledge of what is inside does not affect the story at all.

An example of a detail that is not a MacGuffin is the Ark of the Covenant in the movie "Raiders of the Lost Ark". Even though the Ark is important to the motivation of the movie's hero, Indiana Jones, and the villains, the Nazis, the Ark's importance becomes more clear in the later half of the movie, and it cannot be replaced by anything else because the Nazis' misuse of the Ark was the direct cause of their death at the climax of the movie.

Noli me tangere

The phrase is commonly translated as "don't touch me". In Koine Greek, the phrase reads Μή μου ἅπτου ("mḗ mou háptou"), which is translated differently, as cease holding on to me or stop clinging to me. Many artists and painters have been inspired by the phrase.

In the translation of Saint Jerome, the text is as follows:

"11. Maria "autem stabat ad monumentum foris, plorans. Dum ergo fleret, inclinavit se, et prospexit in monumentum"" - Mary [on the other hand] was near the tomb and wept. While she was weeping, she bent forwards and looked inside the tomb

"12. "et vidit duos angelos in albis sedentes, unum ad caput, et unum ad pedes, ubi positum fuerat corpus Jesu." - And she sees two angels, [dressed in] white, which were sitting, where the corpse of Jesus had been; one at the head, the other at the feet.

"13. "Dicunt ei illi : Mulier, quid ploras ? Dicit eis : Quia tulerunt Dominum meum : et nescio ubi posuerunt eum." - They ask her: woman, why do you weep - she answers them: They have taken my lord, and I don't know where they have put him"

"14. "Hæc cum dixisset, conversa est retrorsum, et vidit Jesum stantem : et non sciebat quia Jesus est." - When she had said this, she turned around, and she sees Jesus standing [there], and she did not know that it was Jesus"

""15 . Dicit ei Jesus : Mulier, quid ploras ? quem quæris ? Illa existimans quia hortulanus esset, dicit ei : Domine, si tu sustulisti eum, dicito mihi ubi posuisti eum, et ego eum tollam."" - Jesus asked her: Woman, why do you weep? Who are you looking for? - She answered him, thinking he was the gardener: My lord, if it was you who took him, you should tell me where you put him, and I will remove him.

"16: "Dicit ei Jesus : Maria. Conversa illa, dicit ei : Rabboni (quod dicitur Magister)." - Jesus said to her "Maria" - she turned around, and said "Raboni", which means master

"17.   "Dicit ei Jesus : Noli me tangere, nondum enim ascendi ad Patrem meum : vade autem ad fratres meos, et dic eis : Ascendo ad Patrem meum, et Patrem vestrum, Deum meum, et Deum vestrum." - Jesus told her: Don't touch me, because I have not risen towards my father. Go, to my brothers, and tell them: I rise twords my father and your father, my god and your god.

"18.   "Venit Maria Magdalene annuntians discipulis : Quia vidi Dominum, et hæc dixit mihi. - Maria of Magdala comes, and she tells the disciples: I have seen the lord, and that's what he told me."

They are marketed as 'Sveriges mest köpta bil' (Swedish for "Sweden's most bought car"), which might technically be correct because of the total number of marshmallows in the shape of cars that are sold. Ahlgrens bilar are so popular in Sweden that some stores that are designed to cater for tourists and residents from Sweden in other countries have started to also sell them.

Other car-related and road-related products are sold as Ahlgrens bilar, including liquorice car tyres, travel trailers and sour road signs. Out of the sour road signs, tourists from Germany specifically enjoy the elk warning signs.

Petunia was introduced by the animator Frank Tashlin in the 1937 short "Porky's Romance". The movie is a parody of a 1932 Walt Disney cartoon called "Mickey's Nightmare", except Mickey Mouse marries his long-time girlfriend Minnie Mouse in that movie. Porky's overtures toward Petunia bring him only the scornful laughs of his lover pig. 

Tashlin adopted Petunia as a regular member of Porky's crew. He (Tashlin) showed her in two more cartoons: "The Case of the Stuttering Pig" and "Porky's Double Trouble".

As Porky's being popular was overshadowed in the late 1930s and 1940s by other characters, such as Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny, he himself was reduced to a supporting player under new Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes shorts. Petunia, only a bit player to Porky's lead, fared worse.

But later, Petunia made appearances in other specials, like "Bugs Bunny's Christmas Carol".

The regular adult Petunia was a guest star under DC Comics' "Looney Tunes"' comic book and in the official "Looney Tunes" website.

Petunia also appears in "Looney Tunes Cartoons". Her first showing in the series was presented in the piece "Happy Birthday, Bugs Bunny".

Baruch Dov Povarsky

Rabbi Baruch Dov Povarsky (born August 17, 1931) is a Haredi rabbi who lives in Israel. He is the rosh yeshiva of the Ponevezh Yeshiva, which is located in the Israeli city of Bnei Brak. 

Rabbi Povarsky was born in the city of Kletsk in the Second Polish Republic; his father was Rabbi Dovid Povarsky. When he was three months old, he and his family moved to the city of Baranavichy, which was in the same country; this was because his father was becoming a teacher in the yeshiva of Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman. When he was ten years old, his entire family moved to Mandatory Palestine (present-day Israel), where he attended several schools before joining the Ponovezh Yeshiva, the school where his father was appointed rosh yeshiva. At that point, Baruch Dov was still a student. In 1954, after he got married, he became a teacher in the yeshiva, and later he became the rosh yeshiva.

Women who have sex with women

Women who have sex with women (WSW) are women who engage in sexual activities with other women. They may be lesbian, heterosexual or bisexual. They may not at all have "any" sexual identity. The term WSW is used often in medical literature to describe such women in a clinical study.

Lesbians are less likely than heterosexual or bisexual women to get screened for cervical cancer. Some are refused medical screenings by medical professionals. 

The lower rate of lesbians tested by regular pap smears makes it more difficult to detect cervical cancer at early stages in these women. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbian women.

Many doctors find woman-to-woman sex to have negligible risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The doctors fail to offer any information on prevention of STI transmission for sex between two females. Lesbians have a lower rate of getting STIs than heterosexual or bisexual women, although the risk still exists.

Dental dams, sex toys and cling wraps are often used as protection when one woman has sex with another woman.

Yisrael Meir Kagan

Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (January 26, 1838 – September 15, 1933) was a rabbi in Eastern Europe who was known as the leader of of Orthodox Jewry. He also wrote very famous books, including "Sefer Chofetz Chaim", and therefore, he is usually referred to as the Chofetz Chaim. He is also famous for being the rosh yeshiva of the Radin Yeshiva.

Rabbi Kagan was born on January 26, 1838 in Dzyatlava, a town that was in those days part of the Russian Empire (nowadays in Belarus). His parents were Rabbi Aryeh Zev and Dobrusha Kagan. When he was nine years old, his father brought him to Vilnius to study in the yeshiva that Rabbi Chaim Nachman Parnes ran. His father was a teacher in the yeshiva as well. Rabbi Kagan's father died when he was eleven years old. His mother married a second husband, whose name was R' Shimon, and their family moved to Radun where R' Shimon came from. Rabbi Kagan married R' Shimon's daughter, whose name was Freida.

In 1869, Rabbi Kagan opened up a yeshiva in Radun, Belarus that became known as the Radin Yeshiva, and was sometimes also called "Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim", since Rabbi Kagan, who opened it, was called "the Chofetz Chaim". In the 1870s, he wrote the "Sefer Chofetz Chaim", a book that discusses the "halachos" (Jewish laws) about not saying hurtful things. The book was very popular, and nowadays, he's known as the "Chofetz Chaim." In 1907, he completed a six volume series called the "Mishna Berurah", in which he discussed the "halachos" pertaining to Jews' everyday life, Shabbat, and holidays. He became famous to Orthodox Jews and many people came to visit him for blessings; he was considered the leader of Orthodox Jewry. He died on September 15, 1933.

Colorado tick fever

Colorado tick fever (CTF) is a viral infection (Coltivirus) transmitted from the bite of an infected Rocky Mountain wood tick ("Dermacentor andersoni"). It should not be confused with the bacterial tick-borne infection, Rocky Mountain spotted fever. CTF is transmitted to humans most commonly by the bite of an infected adult wood tick, and while there is no evidence of natural person-to-person transmission, rare cases of transmission by blood transfusion have been reported. In general, adult ticks are approximately the size of a sesame seed and nymphal ticks are approximately the size of a poppy seed. The Lyme disease bacterium, "Borrelia burgdorferi", is spread through the bite of infected ticks. Symptoms include:

Jerome Kern

Jerome Kern was an American songwriter. He was born in New York City on January 27, 1885 and died in New York City on November 11, 1945 at the age of 60.

Jerome Kern is often called the father of American musical theater. Kern is remembered for the hundreds of songs he wrote for musical plays and movies. Music historians say that Kern gave artistic importance to American popular music for the first time. And, they say, he led the development of the first truly American theater music.

Jerome Kern was born into a middle-class family in New York City in 1885. Jerome’s mother, Fanny, loved the piano. She began to teach Jerome how to play when he was very young. He became a fair piano player but not so good that anyone expected him to become a great musician.

Jerome was a quiet boy and not a top student. When he completed high school, his father said he would have to work in the family’s store. Mister Kern said his son could never make money writing music. But he later came to believe that Jerome might do better in music than in business after all. So he let the boy go to Europe to study music, as almost all serious young musicians did at the time.

Jerome Kern began his career as a songwriter in theaters in London and New York City. Success came quickly. By the early 1920s, Kern was a successful young composer for Broadway musical comedies. In one three-year period alone, he wrote music for 19 shows.

Other people wrote the words for Kern's songs. Kern wrote only the music. And he worked with each song until he was satisfied that the music was perfect. He almost never changed his music to fit the words. One of Kern's best-loved songs is "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes", sung by Dinah Washington.

Although Kern's songs are easy to remember after hearing a few times, they are not simple. His melodies -- the musical line of the song -- are always inventive, even demanding. An example of his inventiveness is the song "All the Things You Are". Several composers say they consider it the greatest song ever written. Singers continue to like Kern songs because they can be sung in many different ways. The melody remains the same. But different singers can change the feeling of the song completely.

Jerome Kern once said he was trying to bring modern art to music. One critic wrote this about his music: Kern's songs are like black and white drawings. They need no color, no decoration. A Kern song is always in balance, perfect in form and pleasing in design. Here is an example, "Why Do I Love You?" played by Andre Previn and friends.

All but one of Kern's songs were written for musical plays. American musical plays at that time were still usually copied from European ones. Often the stories seemed foolish and the people in them did not seem real. Songs and dances often had no connection to the story.

Kern wanted to try something completely new. He thought a musical play should be a real work of art, not just a collection of songs and dances. He thought songs should help move the action of the play along, by showing a person's feelings. Kern wanted to do a truly American musical, with real American characters and real situations.

In 1927, he found the story he wanted. It was the book "Show Boat" by American writer Edna Ferber. "Show Boat" takes place in the 1818s on a passenger steam boat that travels along the Mississippi River. The boat is called a show boat because singers and dancers entertain the passengers. The captain of the show boat has a daughter who is a singer on the boat. She falls in love with a man who earns his money by gambling with cards.

The story dealt with some unusually serious issues for a musical. It showed the hard lives of African-Americans in the South. And it showed marriage between people of different races, which was against the law at that time. Although serious in places, "Show Boat" was not a tragedy.

The public and critics loved it. "Show Boat" became the greatest work of American musical theater. Music critics said Kern's effect on musical theater was revolutionary. It was Kern's music that made the show a great success. Perhaps his most famous song was written for "Show Boat." It is called "Ol' Man River".

It is about what life was like for black people who worked along the Mississippi River. Edna Ferber later remembered her excitement when Kern first played the melody for her. She said her hair stood up, and tears came to her eyes. Paul Robeson sang the song.

West Potomac Park

The West Potomac Park is a park in Washington, D.C.. It is just west of the National Mall. It is home to some of Washington's most famous places, like the Jefferson Memorial, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, and the Tidal Basin. But, the park’s most famous attraction is cherry blossoms.

Thousands of cherry trees bloom around the waters of the Tidal Basin, which reflect the trees’ images. The basin was created in the late 1800s to prevent the Potomac River from flooding. These pink and white flowers serve as a symbol of international friendship. 

The original cherry trees were a gift from Japan. On March 26, 1912, more than 3,000 cherry trees arrived in Washington. Most were planted around the Tidal Basin. But cherry trees were also planted near the Washington Monument and the White House.

The park service maintains West Potomac Park, and helps protect the cherry trees.

It is a wonderful gift that is over 100 years old now. The 1912 gift from the people of Japan has grown to this 3,800 trees. The cherry blossoms also serve as a symbol of the beginning of springtime. The trees burst with colors of soft pink and white. The blossoming of the cherry blossoms every spring is sort of the great springtime celebration, not only in the District of Columbia but throughout the United States.

Every year, Washington celebrates the arrival of spring with a two-week Cherry Blossom Festival. More than 1.5 million people from around the world visit the nation’s capital during the festival. They all hope to see the cherry trees at their “peak bloom.” Park officials define "peak bloom" as the period when 70 percent of Washington’s most common cherry tree variety -- the Yoshino trees -- are blooming. Yoshino cherry trees are one of 12 types of cherry trees in Washington. Peak bloom lasts several days each year.

Experts begin making peak bloom predictions in February. Visitors make their travel plans to Washington based on these predictions.

Hurricane Laura

Hurricane Laura was a deadly and destructive tropical cyclone. Hurricane Laura, the 1856 Last Island hurricane and Hurricane Ida are the strongest hurricanes to make landfall in Louisiana in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the strongest to affect Louisiana since Hurricane Camille brought category 5 winds to the rural southeast portion of the state. The twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first major storm of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Laura formed from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of West Africa on August 16, and formed into a tropical depression by August 20. On August 21, Laura strengthened into a tropical storm, becoming the earliest twelfth named storm, and breaking 1995's Hurricane Luis's record by eight days.

Laura first moved over the Lesser Antilles and brushing Puerto Rico as a tropical storm. It made landfall in the resort city of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, killing four people in the Dominican Republic and 31 in Haiti. The storm then moved over the entire island of Cuba, forcing the evacuation of more than 260,000 people. Then, the outer rainbands of Laura moved over parts of the Florida Keys and Southern Florida. It then moved over the warm Gulf of Mexico, strengthening slowly at first, before undergoing rapid intensification by August 26. Later that day, Laura became a major hurricane, and soon reached a peak intensity of , making it a Category 4 hurricane.

Then, just a couple of hours after reaching peak intensity, at 6:00 UCT on August 27, Laura made landfall in Cameron, Louisiana just below peak intensity with 150 mph (240 km/h) and a pressure of 939 mbar, at the same wind speed of the 1856 Last Island hurricane. It was the 10th strongest tropical cyclone to ever hit the United States in terms of wind speed, killed 42 people in the U.S, and caused $19 billion in damage on the Gulf Coast of the United States and inland areas. After landfall, Laura weakened, falling to tropical storm status later in the day, and tropical depression status over Arkansas the next day. On August 29, Laura weakened to a remnant low over Kentucky, before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone over the East Coast. Overall, Laura caused $19.1 billion in damage and killed 81 people. Areas that were badly affected by Laura, mostly southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana, were badly affected by more flooding and strong winds during Hurricane Delta around six weeks later.

Sarah Emma Edmonds

Sarah Emma Edmonds (December 1841 – September 5, 1898), was a Canadian woman who claimed to have served as a man as a nurse and spy with the Union Army during the American Civil War. In 1992, she was enlisted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.

In 1864, Boston publisher DeWolfe, Fiske, & Co. published her account of her military experiences as "The Female Spy of the Union Army".

Born in 1841 in New Brunswick, at that point a British settlement, Edmonds grew up with her sisters on their family's homestead close to Magaguadavic Lake, not a long way from the State of Maine. Edmonds fled home at age fifteen to get away from a planned marriage and the maltreatment of her dad, who needed a child rather than a girl. Supported by her mother, who herself married young, Edmonds got away from the marriage and pretended to be a man to travel more easily. A male mask let Edmonds eat, travel, and work freely. Edmonds worked selling Bibles door to door. for a Bible book retailer and distributer in Hartford, Connecticut.

Her enthusiasm was started by a book she read in her childhood by Maturin Murray Ballou called "Fanny Campbell, the Female Pirate Captain", telling the story of Fanny Campbell on a privateer transport during the American Revolution while dressed as a man. Fanny stayed dressed as a man so as to seek after different experiences, to which Edmonds credits her longing to dress in drag. During the Civil War, on May 25, 1861, she enrolled in Company F of the second Michigan Infantry, otherwise called the Flint Union Grays. Later she masked herself as a man named "Franklin Flint Thompson," named after Flint, Michigan. She felt that it was her obligation to serve her nation. She from the start filled in as a male field nurse in campaigns under General McClellan, including the First and Second Battle of Bull Run, Antietam, the Peninsula Campaign, Vicksburg, Fredericksburg, and others. 

She had an opportunity during the war when a Union spy in Richmond, Virginia was found and shot, and a companion, James Vesey, was executed in a snare. She exploited the open spot and the chance to vindicate her companion's demise. She applied for, and won, the situation as Franklin Thompson. There is no proof in her military records that she actually served as a spy, but there is plenty about it in her book.

Making a trip into hostile area to assemble data required many disguises.. One camouflage required Edmonds to utilize silver nitrate to color her skin dark, wear a dark hairpiece, and stroll into the Confederacy masked as an individual of color by the name of Cuff. Some other time she entered as an Irish vendor lady by the name of Bridget O'Shea, guaranteeing that she was offering apples and cleanser to the officers. Once more, she was "working for the Confederates" as a dark laundress when a bundle of authentic papers dropped out of an official's coat. At the point when Thompson came back to the Union with the papers, the commanders were enchanted. Some other time, she filled in as an investigator in Kentucky as Charles Mayberry, revealing a Confederacy operator.

Edmonds' profession as Frank Thompson came to an end when she traveled to Berry's Brigade so as to convey mail to Union powers. While trying to take an easy route, she was tossed into a ditch by her donkey and injured. In 1863, she contracted malaria. She thought if she went to a military emergency clinic she would be found out. She went to a private medical clinic, expecting to come back to military life once she had recovered. Then she saw banners posting Frank Thompson as a deserter. She chose to fill in as a female nurse at a Washington, D.C. clinic for injured troopers run by the United States Christian Commission. 

In 1882, Edmonds began the process of clearing the charge of desertion from Thompson's record in order to receive a pension. She got a pension of $12 a month.

Farmers to Families Food Box

The Farmers to Families Food Box program is set up by the United States' government during the COVID-19 pandemic to help get fresh food from farmers to consumers. The food is put into "family-sized" boxes containing produce, dairy products and/or meat. The programs is run by the USDA (Department of Agriculture). It is part of the government's general response to the pandemic, called the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program run by the USDA. It was announced on April 15, 2020. According to the program's home page, over 70,000,000 boxes were invoiced between the start date and then end of August. As of the second week of August 2020, the program's budget was three billion dollars. 

The USDA buys the produce from farmers. Then the food is sent to local packaging companies. These companies distribute the packages to local organizations such as NGOs and religious orga
nizations. The program sets no restrictions on which families may pick of the boxes. 

The program has been positively received. However, there has been some criticism. For example, the boxes weigh forty pounds. This can make it difficult for people without a car to get the boxes home. Also, the program initially only had boxes with produce, dairy products and meat. Since some people do not eat dairy or meat products, this created a problem. 
It has also been stated that specialty-crop farmers have not been helped enough by the program.

Run out

A run out is a way of getting a batter out in cricket. It involves hitting a wicket with the ball when no batsman is in the ground of that wicket; the batsman who is out is the one who is nearest to that ground, or if both batsmen are in a ground, the batsman who reached that ground second. Run outs can happen when batters are trying to score runs by running between the two grounds.

When a bowler is readying himself to bowl, the ball becomes live; if the nonstriker leaves the ground at the bowler's end before the bowler has thrown the ball, then the bowler can hit the wicket in this ground with the ball to "mankad" the nonstriker.

A stumping is a special type of run out in which the wicketkeeper (the fielder with gloves behind the striking batter) hits the wicket in the ground at the striker's end with the ball when the striker is out of that ground.

Stumpings are not allowed on no-balls; a striker who is not trying to run can only be run out on a no-ball if the wicketkeeper has another fielder help him.

Bowled

In cricket, a batter can be out bowled if the bowler delivers the ball to the batter and it hits the wicket behind the batter before touching anyone other than the batter. When the wicket is hit, one of its 5 sticks must fall to the ground for the batter to be out. A batter can't be bowled if the ball was not delivered legally.

A batter can also be out leg before wicket (LBW) if they use their body to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket.

South American sea lion

The South American sea lion ("Otaria flavescens"), is a type of sea lion. It is also called the Southern Sea lion and the Patagonian sea lion.

Pseudorandom number generator

A pseudorandom number generator is a way that computers generate numbers. "There is no known way for a computer to generate numbers which are truly random". A computer algorithm can generate numbers which look random.

An analogy is a jar of (numbered) marbles. Humans can reach into the jar and grab "random" marbles. However, to understand pseudo random numbers, we must understand that this process is not random. We decided to reach into the bag based off of our brain giving us a signal to reach in this way, and the marbles themselves being arranged in a certain way.

Pseudo-random number generators are computer routines which tell the computer how to produce a number which "looks" random.

The initial position of the marbles is called the "seed." The seed is used to create the randomness. To come up with the seed some programs use time of day, while others convert background noise into a number.

When you need to get the next random number ("marble") the generator calculates it with some algorithm. It is based on the previous generated number, in turn, depending on the initial "seed." The algorithm is strict, it will always produce the same sequence of random numbers ("marbles") given the same initial "seed".

The batter can hit the ball and then run between the wickets to score runs, while his partner does the same but crossing him. If the ball is thrown at a wicket before a player from the batting team gets to it, then the teams swap. 


Plaquita

La plaquita or la placa is a form of street cricket played in the Dominican Republic. It involves two teams of two players, and two wickets (which can be license plates, known as "placas" in Spanish).

Bluestar's Prophecy

Bluestar's Prophecy is a teen fantasy novel in the "Warriors" series by Erin Hunter. This is the second "Warriors" "Super Edition" (a standalone story that is longer than most "Warriors" books). The main character is a cat named Bluestar. The book tells her life story, from her birth to the day she becomes leader of a group of cats called ThunderClan. It was published by HarperCollins and released on 28 July 2009.

Bluestar is called Bluekit, Bluepaw, and Bluefur during different parts of her life.

"Bluestar's Prophecy" follows the life of Bluestar, the leader of ThunderClan. The book starts with a prologue that recounts Bluestar's death in "A Dangerous Path". The book then goes back to Bluestar's childhood, during which Goosefeather, the Clan's medicine cat, receives a prophecy about Bluepaw being a fire that will blaze through the forest, but who will be destroyed by water. A few moons later, Bluepaw's mother, Moonflower, is killed in a battle.

Bluestar's childhood is defined by her relationship with her sister, Snowfur, which is damaged when Snowfur falls in love with Thistleclaw, whom Bluefur finds arrogant and untrustworthy. Snowfur is later killed when she is hit by a car, leaving a heartbroken Bluefur to care for Snowfur's son, Whitekit.

Bluefur later meets a RiverClan warrior named Oakheart, and although they do not like each other at first, they eventually fall in love. They decide to spend one night together, but agree that for the good of their Clans, they will never meet again afterwards. One moon later, Bluefur is horrified to find out that she is expecting kittens. Thrushpelt, a ThunderClan warrior with feelings for Bluefur, offers to help her take care of her kits. Bluefur accepts his offer, allowing the rest of ThunderClan to believe that Thrushpelt is the father of her kits.

Sunstar, ThunderClan's leader, tells Bluefur that he was planning to make her ThunderClan's new deputy (second-in-command), but because of her kittens, he will promote Thistleclaw to deputy instead. After having a vision of Thistleclaw drenched in blood, Bluefur realizes that allowing him to become deputy and then leader would be deadly to the Clan. She decides to take her three kits to Oakheart and let them be raised in RiverClan. During this, one of her kits, Mosskit, freezes to death. Her other kits, Mistykit and Stonekit, make it to RiverClan. She explains the disappearance of her kits by pretending they have been taken by a starving fox.

Without her kits, Bluefur is made deputy. After Sunstar dies, she becomes leader, taking on the name Bluestar. After successfully leading ThunderClan for several seasons, she receives a prophecy from the ThunderClan medicine cat (healer), Spottedleaf: “Fire alone can save our Clan.” Later, while walking by a human town, she catches sight of a bright ginger house cat named Rusty. Recognizing him as the cat from Spottedleaf's prophecy, she names him Firepaw and takes him into ThunderClan.

Yellowfang's Secret

Yellowfang's Secret is a teen fantasy novel written by Cherith Baldry under the pen name Erin Hunter. It is the fifth "Super Edition" in the "Warriors" novel series. "Yellowfang's Secret" was first released in hardcover on 9 October 2012. It focuses on a cat named Yellowfang, who lives with forest cats who call themselves Clans.

"Yellowfang's Secret" follows Yellowfang, the ThunderClan medicine cat (healer), during her early life in ShadowClan. Yellowfang trains as a warrior apprentice (a cat who hunts and fights), but realizes that she would do better as a medicine cat. The story in the book takes place at the same time as the other Super Editions "Bluestar's Prophecy" and "Crookedstar's Promise". It is written for readers 8-12 years old.

Yellowfang is called Yellowkit when she is born. She is born in ShadowClan. Her parents are Brightflower and Brackenfoot. Her siblings are Nutkit and Rowankit. Yellowfang has a special power: she feels other cats' pain as if it were hers. When she is small, both she and Nutkit have pain in their stomach one day, even though Nutkit is the only one who is really sick.

When Yellowkit is older, she is renamed Yellowpaw. A cat named Deerleap teaches her how to be a warrior, where she will hunt and fight for her Clan. She becomes close with a cat called Raggedpelt. The other cats do not like Raggedpelt because the think his father might have been a house cat (Clan cats do not like house cats because they think they are lazy). Yellowpaw tries to help Raggedpelt find out who his father was. But when they find out his father really was a house cat, things become worse for Raggedpelt. Hal, Raggedpelt's father, rejects Raggedpelt, and then Raggedpelt kills Hal. Another female cat, Foxheart, also likes Raggedpelt, but Raggedpelt likes Yellowpaw.

Yellowpaw is eventually renamed Yellowfang, and she completes her training and becomes a warrior. Sagewhisker, the ShadowClan medicine cat, convinces Yellowfang that her ability to feel other cats' pain would make her a very good medicine cat. At first, Yellowfang wants to stay as a warrior instead, but later she changes her mind. Yellowfang becomes Sagewhisker's apprentice and takes the medicine cat's vows. In this book, being a medicine cat means never having a mate or kittens. But Yellowfang stays with Raggedpelt in secret, against the rules.

Yellowfang finds out that she is pregnant. Because this is against the medicine cat rules, Yellowfang gives birth in secret. Only one kitten survives. She names the kitten Brokenkit and gives it to Raggedpelt. The Clan thinks Foxheart is Brokenkit's mother. However, he is nursed by a cat named Lizardstripe, who is mean to him. Her kittens also bully him. Brokenkit grows up angry and misguided. Eventually, Brokenkit becomes a warrior and is renamed Brokentail. He eventually becomes the deputy (second-in-command) of the Clan. Brokentail trains the young cats of his Clan harshly. When Raggedpelt (who has become leader of ShadowClan and is now called Raggedstar) tells Brokentail it is too much, Brokentail pretends to agree, but seceretly plans to kill him, so that he can become leader of the Clan. Brokentail's plan works, and he makes it look like cats from another Clan, WindClan, killed Raggedpelt.

Brokentail becomes Brokenstar. He rules ShadowClan cruelly. Using his father's death as an excuse, he has ShadowClan attack WindClan, eventually driving them out. He begins training kittens before they are six months old, which is against the rules the Clans live by. He tells old cats to leave the camp and fend for themselves, which is also against the Clan's rules. When a kitten dies in battle, Yellowfang speaks up against Brokenstar's cruelty, which leads Brokenstar to set up another plan: falsely accusing her of the deaths of two other kittens, and banishing her from the Clan.

Yellowfang leaves and she goes to ThunderClan territory, where, exhausted by rage and hunger, she is attacked by a ThunderClan cat named Firepaw. After a brief fight, Yellowfang admits defeat. Yellowfang is taken to the ThunderClan camp, where she slowly comes to love ThunderClan, and is eventually invited to stay there for good.

A bonus comic scene at the end of the book shows Yellowfang killing Brokenstar with a poisonous berry, in an attempt to put right everything she has done wrong in her life.

Barnes & Noble said this book was "an epic stand-alone adventure." It has a ranking of 4.7 out of 5 stars on the Barnes & Noble website.

Free culture

Free culture is a concept and a movement that tries to help people share art very freely. It says copyright laws are too strict and tries to create a less limiting system. The word "free" In "free culture" means "freedom", not price.

The beginning of the movement is connected to Lawrence Lessig who has written a book named Free Culture and started Creative Commons, an organization that supports things like free culture and education. The movement is similar to free software movement but focuses on all art works, e.g. images or songs. Some free cultural works are for example the movie Big Buck Bunny or files at Wikimedia Commons. Wikipedia is also part of free culture because it uses a free license for its articles.

Works, for example movies, that respect free culture are called "free cultural works" or simply "free works". These works have to allow anyone to:


The artist who creates something can make it free by adding a free license to it. Most famous free licenses are Creative Commons (CC) licenses. However, not all Creative Commons licenses are free (some for example prohibit commercial use or changing the work). The free CC licenses are CC0, CC-BY and CC-BY-SA.

Urban morphology

Urban morphology is the field of research, study, study, and design of the form of human settlement and the process of their formation and change. This study seeks to understand the spatial structure and nature of: "metropolis, city, town, neighborhood, compound, or agricultural locality" of any kind, by examining the patterns of the component parts Its and the ownership or control and given of the form of land uses. Usually the analysis of the physical form focuses on the pattern of the street, the plot (or for example in UK "the plot") and the building patterns. Land use analysis specifically is usually conducted using cartographic sources and the development process is derived from a comparison of historical maps. Special attention is paid to how the physical shape of a city changes over time and how different cities compare to each other. Another significant part of this research profession deals with the study of the social forms that are expressed in the physical arrangement of a city, and vice versa, how the physical form produces or recreates various social forms.

Olfactores

Olfactores is a group, called a clade, in taxonomy. Taxonomy is the way scientists put living things in groups to show how they are related to each other. Olfactores is part of the phylum Chordata, animals with notochords. These are rods of tissue that form inside the developing embryo. In many organisms, the notochord helps the spine or nervous system grow, but some animals have only a notochord and no spinal bones. Olfactores contains Vetulicolia, Tunicata (Urochordata) and Vertebrata (also named Craniata). Most animals in Chordata are also in Olfactores. Only the animals in Cephalochordata are in Chordata but not Olfactores.

Scientists started to think taxonomy needed a special name for this group of living things in 2006. They studied large numbers of data and saw a pattern that said the organisms in Olfactores had a relationship with each other that they did not have with cephalochordates. The name "olfactores" comes from Latin word "olfactus" for "sense of smell." Scientists named this clade "Olfactores" because the animals in it grow a pharynx as part of their respiratory system and use it to breathe. Cephalochordates, for example the lancelet, do not have respiratory systems and they do not have any organs whose job is only to smell things.

The shooting happened in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 23, 2020, as officers were attempting to arrest Blake. There was an arrest warrant against Blake for criminal trespass, domestic abuse, and sexual assault. 

During the encounter, Blake was tasered and scuffled with officers. He was shot as he opened the driver's door to his SUV and leaned in. Three of Blake's sons were in the backseat. 

The shooting was followed by protests, property damage, arson, and shooting deaths in downtown Kenosha.

Both the state of Wisconsin and the U.S. federal government decided not to charge police officer Rusten Sheskey with a crime for the shooting.

Kenosha unrest

In August 2020, in the aftermath of the Jacob Blake shooting, protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States and elsewhere occurred as part of the larger Black Lives Matter movement and reactions to other high-profile police killings of unarmed Black people in 2020. 
After police shot Jacob Blake, many people protested in Kenosha. It was not wholly a peaceful protest. Some people broke into shops and stole the things inside. Some shops were burned down. Armed civilian counter-protesters also came, some of them from other states. They said they wanted to protect businesses.
On August 24, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers activated the Wisconsin National Guard to protect fire fighters and critical infrastructure in Kenosha.

On August 25, one of the civilian volunteers shot three people, two of whom were later pronounced dead. The shooter was a 17 year old named Kyle Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse later walked towards police vehicles with his hands up and still armed with a semi-automatic rifle, but the police vehicles drove past him. Both the men he killed, Anthon Huber, 26, and Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, were white. Many conservatives thought Rittenhouse did not deserve to go to prison, and an online fund for his $2 million bail was filled.

Kyle Rittenhouse's trial is scheduled to start on November 1. He is charged with homicide: first-degree reckless homicide, first-degree intentional homicide and attempted first-degree intentional homicide. He is also charged with carrying a weapon even though he was under 18 years old, which is illegal in that state. The largest punishment he could get is life in prison.

Davies' tree frog tadpoles are different from other tadpoles. Their mouths have no beaks or teeth.

There are fewer Davies' tree frogs than there were. The IUCN Red List says they are a vulnerable species. Scientists say there are fewer Davies' tree frogs because human beings have changed their places where they live from forests, because of predators, and because there are not enough Davies' tree frogs in one place for them to find unrelated partners and make healthy offspring.

INaturalist

iNaturalist is an American website where people post scientific information about plants, animals and other living things. Usually, they send photographs of which living things they saw and say where and when they saw them.

iNaturalist works by crowdsourcing, by asking many, many people to work on the project. Some of the people who send information to iNaturalist are professional scientists and some are citizen scientists, ordinary people who want to help scientific projects. iNaturalist sends information to International Union for the Conservation of Nature and other projects that watch endangered animals and other populations. iNaturalist users can help park rangers and other people who work in forests find and identify invasive species, for example kudzu. According to one park ranger from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the United States, rangers usually already know an invasive plant is in their park, but iNaturalist and programs like it help them find out exactly where it is. Then they can gather people to remove it.

Parks, conservation programs and research teams in many countries have used iNaturalist, for example the United States, Canada and New Zealand.

Students at the University of California at Berkeley founded iNaturalist in 2008. It was a master's thesis project. Since 2014, the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society have run iNaturalist together.

People use their smart phones to look at or send information to iNaturalist, usually photographs. Then other users on the website figure out what the is in the picture.

In 2020, iNaturalist launched a smaller program called Seek. Users with Seek can point their phones at a plant or animal and the program will try to tell them its name. According to iNature's Tony Iwane, "Seek's machine-learning model is based entirely on observations from . . the iNaturalist community, so it's really the hard work of thousands and thousands of people on iNaturalist that enables Seek to function."

The Simpsons (season 2)

The 2nd season of The Simpsons first started showing on the Fox network from October 11, 1990 to July 11, 1991. It has 22 episodes. The season started with the episode "Bart Gets an "F"" and ended with "Blood Feud". The season was first put on DVD for Region 1 on August 6, 2002, Region 2 on July 8, 2002, and Region 4 on July 24, 2002. The season's executive producers were Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon. They were the executive producers for the first season. The episode "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" won a Primetime Emmy Award.

"Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish" was the first episode made in the season. "Bart Gets an "F"" was broadcast first because Bart Simpson was liked by many people in 1990. The 2nd season had a new opening sequence. It was shorter than the one before (which was about 90 seconds). In the opening sequence before, it showed Bart taking a bus stop sign. The opening sequence in the 2nd season shows Bart skateboarding past characters that were shown in the first season. There were three opening sequences made for this season. One was 75 seconds, one was 45 seconds, and one was 25 seconds. This was done so that editors of "The Simpsons" could do more with the length of each episode.

Many new characters were first shown in this season: Mayor Quimby, Kang and Kodos, Maude Flanders, Bill and Marty, Dr. Hibbert, Roger Meyers, Jr., Sideshow Mel, Lionel Hutz, Dr. Nick Riviera, the Blue Haired Lawyer, Rainier Wolfcastle, Troy McClure, Groundskeeper Willie, Hans Moleman, Professor Frink, and Comic Book Guy.

After the first season, Fox moved showings of "The Simpsons" from Sundays to Thursday so that more people would see it. It was to be shown on 8:00 PM, which started competition with "The Cosby Show". Producers of "The Simpsons" thought that the competition would make their ratings lower. In the summer of 1990, many news companies made stories about the competition. In this time, NBC had 208 television stations. Fox only had 133. 

"Bart Gets an "F"" (the first episode of the season) got almost the same Neilsen rating as "The Cosby Show". The episode got a rating of 18.4 and "The Cosby Show" got a rating of 18.5. "Bart Gets an "F"" was watched by 33.6 million people, which was more than the "Cosby Show". It was the most watched show on that week. In that time, it was the most watched episode on the Fox network ever. The next episode ("Simpson and Delilah") got a Nielsen rating of 16.2, and "The Cosby Show" got a rating of 18.5 again. "Simpson and Delilah" also had more people who watched it when it was first shown. 

The 3rd episode ("Treehouse of Horror") did not get as many people to watch it as "The Cosby Show" did. After that, "The Cosby Show" had higher ratings than most of the other episode of "The Simpsons" 2nd season. "Three Men and a Comic Book" was the only episode of this season to get a higher Neilsen rating than "The Cosby Show" did. That episode was 23rd and "The Cosby Show" was 26th in the ratings for that week. "The Simpsons" did not get higher ratings again until in the 3rd season with the episode "Homer at the Bat". "The Simpsons" stopped showing on Thursdays in the 6th season.

The Book of the City of Ladies

The Book of the City of Ladies or Le Livre de la Cité des Dames (published in 1405), is perhaps Christine de Pizan's most famous literary work. Pizan originally wrote Le Livre de la Cité des Dames in Middle French but it was later translated into English (1999). The book serves as her formal response to Jean de Meun's popular "Roman de la Rose". Pizan combats Meun's statements about women by creating an allegorical city of ladies. She defends women by collecting a wide array of famous women throughout history. These women are "housed" in the City of Ladies, which is an imaginary city from the book. As Pizan builds her city, she uses each famous woman as a building block for the walls and houses of the city. Each woman added to the city adds to Pizan's argument towards women as valued participants in society. She also advocates in favour of education for woman.

Part I opens with Christine reading from Matheolus's Lamentations, a work from the thirteenth century that addresses marriage wherein the author writes that women make men's lives miserable. Upon reading these words, Christine becomes upset and feels ashamed to be a woman. The three Virtues then appear to Christine, and tell her that she has been chosen by god to create a city for woman.

In Part II, Lady Rectitude says she will help Christine "construct the houses and buildings inside the walls of the City of Ladies" and fill it with inhabitants who are "valiant ladies of great renown". As they build, Lady Rectitude tells Christine stories of powerful woman that will be housed inside the city. Lady Rectitude also refutes allegations that women are unchaste, inconstant, unfaithful, and mean by nature through her stories. This part closes with Christine addressing women and asking them to pray for her as she continues her work with Lady Justice to complete the city.

In Part III, Lady Justice joins with Christine to "add the finishing touches" to the city, including bringing a queen to rule the city. Lady Justice tells Christine of female saints who were praised for their martyrdom. At the close of this part, Christine makes another address to all women announcing the completion of the City of Ladies. She beseeches them to defend and protect the city and to follow their queen (the Virgin Mary). She also warns the women against the lies of slanderers, saying, "Drive back these treacherous liars who use nothing but tricks and honeyed words to steal from you that which you should keep safe above all else: your chastity and your glorious good name".

A few women who were mentioned include:
Medusa, Helen of Troy, Polyxena, Florence of Rome, Isabeau of Bavaria, Joan of Armagnac, Margaret of Bavaria, Isis, Marie, Duchess of Auvergne, Margaret of Burgundy, Duchess of Bavaria, Marie of Savoy, Countess of Saint-Pol, Anne de Bourbon and The Virgin Mary.

Australian lace-lid

The Australian lace-lid, Day's big-eyed tree frog or lace-eyed tree frog ("Ranoidea dayi") is a tree frog from Australia. It lives in northeastern Queensland.

The adult frog is 5.0 cm long. Unlike other male frogs, which can sing in groups, male Australian lace-lids are always at least 1 metre apart from each other when they sing. Scientists think that the males compete against each other for the females, that they are territorial animals.

This frog lives in rainforests, especially mountain rainforests. It will eat almost anything it can catch, usually invertebrates, for example spiders and insects. Its large eyes help it hunt at night.

The female frog lays eggs under rocks in streams where the water flows fast. The eggs are clear and 3.3 to 3.5 mm in diameter. The tadpoles have strong tails so they can swim in the fast water. The tadpoles eat algae on the bottom of the stream. Tadpoles that hatch early become frogs in 3-4 months. Tadpoles that hatch in the fall may stay tadpoles through the winter and become frogs the next year.

Scientists are not sure why this frog is endangered. One idea is that feral pigs have come to their rainforests and rip up the low plants that the frog likes to climb on and hide in. Another idea is that the fugal disease chytridiomycosis could be killing these frogs.

Kolkhoz

Kolkhoz (, a contraction of коллективное хозяйство, "collective ownership", kollektivnoye khozaystvo) is the name given to large farms that existed in the Soviet Union, and that were organised as a cooperative. A group of people would run these farms; they also owned the means of production (like the machines they needed), but not the land, which was owned by the state. 

The state also ran farms during that time, which were known as Sovkhoz. These farms existed from about 1917, the date of the October Revolution, to 1991, when the Soviet Union was disbanded. In a Sovkhoz, people were employed, and did not own any means of production. 

As a collective farm, a "kolkhoz" was legally organized as a production cooperative. The Standard Charter of a kolkhoz is a model of cooperative principles in print. It speaks of the kolkhoz as a "form of agricultural production cooperative of peasants that voluntarily unite for the purpose of joint agricultural production based on [...] collective labor". It asserts that "the kolkhoz is managed according to the principles of socialist self-management, democracy, and openness, with active participation of the members in decisions concerning all aspects of internal life".

They imposed detailed work programs and nominated their preferred managerial candidates. Since the mid-1930s, the kolkhozes had been in effect an offshoot of the state sector (although notionally they continued to be owned by their members). Nevertheless, in locations with particularly good land or if it happened to have capable management, some kolkhozes accumulated substantial sums of money in their bank accounts. As a result, many kolkhozes were formally nationalized by changing their status to "sovkhozes". The faint dividing lines between collective and state farms were obliterated almost totally in the late 1960s, when Khrushchev's administration authorized a guaranteed wage to kolkhoz members, similarly to sovkhoz employees. Essentially, his administration recognized their status as hired hands rather than authentic cooperative members. The guaranteed wage provision was incorporated in the 1969 version of the Standard Charter.

Cohabitation

Cohabitation is an arrangement where people who are romantically or sexually attracted to each other live together, without being married. In most cases, the two people will be of opposite sex, but the term can also be used to describe same-sex relationships. Cohabitation has become common in many countries. In these countries, a percentage of children are born outside marriage.

Wyoming toad

The Wyoming toad or Baxter's toad ("Anaxyrus baxteri") is a toad that has become rare. The only living Wyoming toads are in captivity. For example, the Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Wyoming breeds these toads. It was listed as "endangered" in 1984, and as "extinct in the wild" in 1991. There were suddenly far fewer Wyoming toads around 1975 and the toad extremely rare by 1980. To prevent extinction, a captive breeding program was started in 1989 at the Thorne Williams Unit. This program produced enough young toads in the first few years to send toads to seven different zoos. In 1998, the Saratoga National Fish Hatchery received toads to breed. Between 1995 and 2006, when the remaining captive toads were moved from the Thorne Williams Unit to the Red Buttes Environmental Biology Laboratory south of Laramie, nearly 46,000 offspring had been produced at the Thorne Williams Unit and released back into the wild. Before the sharp declines occurred, this toad was classified as a subspecies of the Canadian toad.
In nature, the female toad leaves her eggs in the shallow parts of ponds and lakes. The tadpoles swim in the warmest parts of the water.

Adult frogs look for food during the day and hide at night. Sometimes they go into burrows dug by rodents. Adult frogs eat mostly ants but they also eat beetles and other animals without backbones.

Scientists are not sure why the Wyoming toad started to die out in the 1970s. They think it might have been that people were using an insect-killing chemical called Baytex, that seagulls, pelicans and raccoons were eating the toads, or that irrigation for hay growing changed their living space.

Ten Little Indians

The Ten Little Indians is an American nursery rhyme. The term "Indians" in this sense refers to the Native Americans in the United States.

The modern lyrics for this song are:

Songwriter Septimus Winner created an elaborated version of the children's song, called "Ten Little Injuns", in 1868 for a minstrel show.

It is generally thought the song was adapted, possibly by Frank J. Green in 1869 as "Ten Little Niggers". It's also possible, however, that the influence was the other way around, with "Ten Little Niggers" being a close reflection of the text which then became "Ten Little Indians". 

Agatha Christie's book, "And Then There Were None", was first called "Ten Little Niggers" and then "Ten Little Indians".

Due to the use of racist words, modern versions for children usually use "soldier boys" or "teddy bears" as objects in the rhyme.

"Ten Little Indians" is a 1962 pop and rock-n-roll song from the Beach Boys. It's on their studio album "Surfin' Safari".

Several "Looney Tunes" and "Merrie Melodies" short films used the song. In "Tom Tom Tomcat", Tweety sings the song while writing down the number of Indian cats Granny has taken down so far.

In England's "Mickey Mouse Annual" No. 6, the song was adapted into the comic "10 Little Mickey Kids". It told of little mouse babies who met their end until there were two left.

2019 Hong Kong extradition bill

The Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 was a proposed bill in Hong Kong. It would have changed a law that was already there, the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance (Cap. 503) in relation to special submission arrangements and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance (Cap. 525). It would have changed the way the government of Hong Kong asked for people to be arrested in any other part of the People's Republic of China, namely mainland China, Macau, and Taiwan, with which it did not already have an existing law. The Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 was never passed.

Early in 2018, a 19-year-old Hong Kong resident was arrested in Taiwan for killing his 20-year-old girlfriend. He was tried in Taiwan because the government of Hong Kong had no way to extradite him, to formally ask the government of Taiwan to send him to them as a prisoner. Because of this, people started talking about Hong Kong's criminal law.

In February 2019, the government proposed a change to criminal laws. The law is meant to allow a the government of Hong Kong to arrest anyone suspected of a crime and send them to places where it does not already have a formal extradition treaty, such as mainland China, Macau and Taiwan.

However, organizations like Amnesty International and many Hong Kongers saw that the law could also be used in another way. The law could allow the government to arrest almost any Hong Konger suspected of a crime and send them to be tried in mainland China instead of in Hong Kong. Mainland China has a reputation for unfair trials. They worried that the government would use this to arrest Hong Kongers who spoke against the mainland government and bring them to China as political prisoners and scare the people of Hong Kong.

The government stopped trying to pass the bill on June 15 and formally withdrew it on October 23, 2019.

This bill was one of the reasons Hong Kongers protested in the 2019 Hong Kong protests.


Subzero (horse)

Subzero (nickname: Subbie) (foaled 26 September 1988 in Australia 29 August 2020) was a Thoroughbred racehorse.

Subzero won the 1992 Melbourne Cup. Trained by Lee Freedman and ridden by veteran jockey Greg Hall, the four-year-old revelled in the rain-affected going to defeat the favourite Veandercross and the two-miler Castletown. The win was to be Subzero's last, but, as one of the few grey winners of the race in the post-War era, his fame was assured.

Upon retirement from racing, the big, near-white gelding with a lovely temperament was employed as the clerk of the course's horse by Racing Victoria's long-time Clerk, Graham Salisbury, and has made numerous appearances on television, at charity functions, and at schools. In July 2008, he was fully retired as he had developed arthritis.

In October 2009, it was reported that Subzero might need to be put down as the medication he needed for his arthritis became unavailable in Australia. However the medication was subsequently sourced from the United States, and Subzero continued to appear in public. In his retirement he was gentle natured, very patient with children and remained with Graham Salisbury until Salisbury's death in June 2020.

On 29 August 2020, he was humanely put down due to a heart condition. He was 31.

Chalcid wasp

The chalcid wasps are formally called the Chalcidoidea. They are a superfamily of parasitoid wasps. They have a huge number of species, estimated as over 500,000 (half a million). The superfamily includes 22 families. The data included morphology and ribosomal 18S data. The researchers comment that only about 22,506 species of the half-million have been formally described.

Most of the species are parasitic on other kinds of insect. They attack the egg or larval stages of at least 12 different insect orders. When that insect is itself a parasitoid, then the chalcid is called a hyperparasitoid. Chalcids are sometimes used to control crop pests. A few chalcids actually eat plants, and the most famous of these are the fig wasps.

There are 19 living families of chalcids.

Nethuns

Nethuns is somewhat like Poseidon except he isn't. Think as though they're cousin yet they're like the same person but different ethnicity. Nethuns is the god of water as well as the god of wells.

Hyperparasite

A hyperparasite is a parasite (or parasitoid) which is parasitic on another parasite. Usually, this means it is parasitic on the larval stage of the victim species.

Typical examples are members of the Apocrita, and some species in two other insect orders, the Diptera (true flies) and Coleoptera (beetles). Seventeen families in the Hymenoptera and a few species of Diptera and Coleoptera are hyperparasitic. 

Primary parasitism in the Hymenoptera evolved in the Jurassic period about 135 million years ago. 

Jonathan Swift refers to hyperparasitism in these lines from his poem "On Poetry: A Rhapsody":

So nat'ralists observe, a flea
Hath smaller fleas that on him prey;
And these have smaller fleas to bite 'em.
And so proceeds "ad infinitum".

Three levels of parasitism have been seen in fungi (a fungus on a fungus on a fungus on a tree).

Political spectrum

A political spectrum is a way to talk about different political positions and how they are similar to or different from other political positions. These positions sit upon one or more geometric axes that represent independent political dimensions. Traditionally, the political spectrum has people who support left-wing ideas on the left and people who support right-wing ideas on the right. 

The Political Compass is like the Political Spectrum but it also asks if people are libertarian or authoritarian.

Fig wasp

Fig wasps are wasps of the superfamily Chalcidoidea which spend their larval stage inside figs. Most pollinate the figs, but others simply feed on the plant. 

The non-pollinators belong to several groups in the superfamily Chalcidoidea. So, the fig wasps are a polyphyletic group: they include several unrelated lineages whose similarities are based upon their shared association with figs. 

The pollinators are all in the family Agaonidae. They make galls. The other types either make their own galls or use the galls of other fig wasps.

Least weasel

The least weasel ("Mustela nivalis") is the world's smallest mammalian carnivore. It is the smallest member of the genus "Mustela", the smallest member of the family Mustelidae and the order Carnivora. 
It is also called the little weasel or common weasel. 

The weasel is native to Eurasia, North America and North Africa. It has been introduced to New Zealand, Malta, Crete, Bermuda, Madeira Island, the Azores, the Canary Islands, São Tomé, the Falkland Islands, Argentina and Chile. It is a least concern species.

The least weasel has a thin, long and very flexible body. It has a small, long, head. The legs and tail are short. The feet have sharp, dark-coloured claws and a lot of hairs on the bottom. Its eyes are small when compared to their head size. Its eyes are dark colored.

The legs and tail are relatively short. The tail makes up less than half the body length.

Males have an average length of long. Females have an average length of long. Males weigh . Females weigh .

Male least weasels have territories that include many female territories. The number of least weasels in each territory depends on the amount of food and reproductive success. The male least weasel has a bigger territory during spring or when there is less food. It uses faeces and urine to mark its territory. The least weasel does not dig its own den, but stays in the burrows that other animals have left, like a mole or rat.

The least weasel mates from April to July. The gestation period is 34 to 37 days. In the Northern Hemisphere, the least weasel usually give birth to 6 kits. Kit is the name for baby weasels. The least weasel is able to reproduce by the age of three to four months.

The female takes care of its kits without help from the male. The kits weigh . Newborn kits are born pink, naked, blind and deaf. They will have a white coat of downy fur at the age of four days. The first teeth come out at the age of two to three weeks. They start to eat solid food at that time.

The eyes and ears open at the age of at three to four weeks. By eight weeks they learn how to kill the animals that they eat. The young ones leave the family after nine to twelve weeks. Least weasels can live for seven or eight years.

The least weasel mostly eats rodents, for example mice, hamsters, and gerbils. It usually does not attack adult hamsters and rats. Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are almost never eaten. It can attack adult pikas and gerbils. Least weasels sometimes kill prey larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel grouse and hares. In England, the least weasel likes to eat the field vole.

Even though it is small, the least weasel is a great hunter. It is able to kill a rabbit five to 10 times its own weight. Even though they are commonly eaten, the rabbits are usually young ones. Rabbits become a very important source of food during the spring, when there are few small rodents.

Red foxes, sables, steppe and forest polecats, stoats, eagle owls and buzzards are predators of the least weasel. Owls are very good at catching least weasels. Some of the owls that hunt least weasels include barn owls, barred owls, and great horned owls. Other birds of prey that eat the least weasel include broad-winged buzzards and rough-legged buzzards. Some types of snake may eat the least weasel. They include the black rat snake and the copperhead.

Ectoparasites also target weasels. Common ones are different species of lice, mites and fleas. Very often, weasels get the parasites from the nests or burrows of their prey. Certain species of nematode also infect weasels.

The least weasel lives in Europe, North Africa, Asia and parts of northern North America. It mostly lives in places where there are no stoats. It has become extinct from New York City. It has been introduced in New Zealand, Malta, Crete, the Azore Islands and São Tomé off West Africa. It is found throughout Europe (but not Ireland). It is also found on many islands, including the Azores, Great Britain, and all major Mediterranean islands. It also lives in Honshū and Hokkaidō Islands in Japan and on Kunashir, Iturup, and Sakhalin Islands in Russia.

The least weasel can be found in fields, open woodland, bushy or rocky places, parks and gardens. It can be found at altitudes of up to about .

The least weasel is listed as a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It has a very large range and a large total population. It is common in Eurasia but less abundant in North America. It is thought to be rare in the southeastern United States.

Bad Mojo

Bad Mojo is a computer game by Pulse Entertainment and Drew Pictures. It was made in 1996. In this game, an insect scientist named Roger is turned into a cockroach and must move through an old house back to his human body. On the way, he learns his landlord Eddie's big secret. It was released on CD-ROM. Vincent Carrella and Phill Simon made the game.

This is an adventure game, which means the player moves through the game world and solves puzzles. There is almost no fighting in this game. The player uses the arrow keys to tell the character where to go. Because he is a cockroach, he can only move himself and very small things. For example, the player can use a lit cigarette butt to burn up a spider that wants to eat the player.

Roger can die by being killed by an animal or by getting stuck in one place for too long. For example, if the player makes Roger step in paint, he can be stuck. Like in arcade games, the player has "lives" meaning Roger can die more than once and still keep playing the game. "Bad Mojo" starts with five lives. The player can also save the game and come back later.

Touching some things in the game starts a full motion video in which actors give clues.

During the game, the spirit of Roger's dead mother, Angelina, can help the player. He can also talk to other cockroaches.

Someone who is good at video games can play "Bad Mojo" from beginning to end in about an hour.

Part of the story for this game came from "Metamorphosis" by Franz Kafka. It is a famous story from 1915. In "Metamorphosis", a man called Gregor Samsa wakes up as a giant insect-like monster.

In "Bad Mojo", insect scientist Roger Sams has stolen one million dollars. He plans to run away with it. Roger's mother, Angelina, died before the game began. Before leaving with his stolen money, Roger touches a necklace that had been his mother's necklace. It is a magical necklace and it turns him into a cockroach and drops him in the sewer below the building. Roger's human body is still upstairs.

Roger has a mean landlord named Eddie. Eddie keeps the building very dirty, so it is full of roaches, rats and spiders. Many of the puzzles the player solves are about sneaking past rats and other animals.

The game can end four different ways depending on whether only Roger lives at the end of the game, only Eddie lives, they both live or they both die.

The electronica group Xorcist made the music for "Bad Mojo". As of 2019, this music was available at Bandcamp.

Richard Cobbett of "PC Gamer" said "Bad Mojo" was "easily the game with the most real-world kills to its name." The gamemakers used many real dead animals to make art for this game.

For one puzzle, the player has to sneak past a trapped rat without being eaten. The gamemakers put a real dead rat on a scanner to make the image. The gamemakers said the only reason they didn't do this with spiders was because the heat of the scanner would turn the spiders' bodies into gas. They also used many live cockroaches and a real dead catfish. They hired a professional cat trainer to manage the real cat, and this cat was not killed or harmed.

The gamemakers said "We only harmed real animals that were on Death Row anyway." For example, the dead rat had already been killed by a restaurant owner.

Reviewers thought "Bad Mojo" was a very good game. Jeffrey Adams of "GameSpot" said it had a "poignant story" and "best computer art you've ever seen in a game." "Metacritic" gave it #10 of the Best Games of 1996 and #9 for the Most Discussed Games of 1996.

In 2004, Pulse Entertainment released "Bad Mojo Redux". It is the same game and story as the original "Bad Mojo" but updated to run on newer computers. Some of the videos and acting were improved as well.

Steppe polecat

The steppe polecat ("Mustela eversmanii"), is a type of mustelid. It is also called the white or masked polecat. It is native to Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is a Least Concern species. It is generally light yellowish, with dark limbs and a dark mask across the face.

Males are 320–562 mm in length. Females are 290–520 mm. Males may weigh up to 2,050 grams. For may weigh up to 1,350 grams.

The winter fur is soft and tall, with short, dense underfur and long, sparse guard hairs. The summer coat is shorter and coarser than the winter fur, and is not as dense and close-fitting, with a more strongly developed ochreous or reddish tone. The ears are completely white, while the throat is yellowish-white or almost white. Sometimes, the head is entirely white. The lower part of the neck is dark blackish-brown or brown, while the chest and front legs are black or blackish-brown. The abdomen is light, yellowish-straw in colour.

During warm seasons, especially in places with lots of ground squirrels. Old steppe polecats do not change territories until there are no prey in it's territory. Generally, the steppe polecat only lives one home range for a few days or up to a few months. In winter, the steppe polecat is more active, and will move 12–18 km a day. During heavy snowfall, the steppe polecat migrates to much better places, such as along the slopes of steppe ravines, near settlements and winter encampments.

The species does not usually dig its own burrow. Instead it uses those of marmots, ground squirrels, hamsters, moles, voles, jerboas and others, after making the burrow a little bit wider.

The mating season is different in different regions. Usually, the steppe polecat mates once a year. The gestation period lasts from 36–43 days. The steppe polecat gives birth to three to six kits. But, the steppe polecat have been known to give birth to 18 kits.

Kits are born blind and naked. At the age of 20 days, the kits darken in colour. Their eyes open after 28–34 days. By the age of 45 days, they are able to hunt young ground squirrels. They start hunting adult ground squirrel at the age of 60 days. The kits stay in the family burrow for 2.0-2.5 months. The kits begin to leave the family from July or later. Steppe polecats reach sexual maturity at the age of 10 months. They become adults at the age of two years.

The steppe polecat hunts large, mammals that live in the steppe such as ground squirrels, hamsters, pikas and young or injured adult marmots. Ground squirrels are the most abundant prey of the steppe polecat throughout the year. In warm seasons, they are hunted on the top of the ground. In autumn, they are dug from their burrows. Male polecats usually have to make the burrows of the ground squirrel to enter them. But, young or female polecats can easily enter them. In places where there are no ground squirrels, the steppe polecat mainly feeds on hamsters and pikas, or water voles on the banks of water bodies. Along the shores of rivers and lakes, fish, chickens and carrion may be eaten. Birds are sometimes killed by the steppe polecat. Amphibians and reptiles are rarely eaten.

The steppe polecat lives in Central and Eastern Europe, southern Russia, northern Georgia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan to Mongolia and northern and western China. In 2014, it has been seen at an altitude of 5,050 m (16,570 ft) in Nepal.

Colombian weasel

The Colombian weasel ("Mustela felipei"), is a very rare type of weasel. It is also called the Don Felipe's weasel. It is only known from the departments of Huila and Cauca in Colombia and nearby northern Ecuador. The Colombian weasel is only known from one Colombian weasel.

It only lives in riparian habitats at an altitude of 1,100 to 2,700 m (3,600 to 8,900 ft). There is lots of deforestation in the riparian habitats in the northern Andes of Colombia and Ecuador. There is less than 10 known dead Colombian weasels that were studied. It is could be the rarest carnivore in South America. It is a vulnerable species.

It is the second-smallest living carnivore on average. The upperparts and tail are blackish-brown, while the underparts are orange-buff.

The first photo of a living Colombian weasel was taken in 2011 by an amateur naturalist who found one trapped in his parents' house; the weasel later escaped. The image was uploaded to iNaturalist in 2018. It gained widespread attention.

The Colombian weasel has a long body. It has an average length of 22 cm (8.7 in). Its tail is 11.5 cm (4.5 in) long. It weighs between 120 and 150 g (4.2 and 5.3 oz). The Colombian weasel has a dark dorsal color. It also has a light orange color. The bottom of the feet does not have any fur. It has webbed feet that is found on the second, third, and fourth toes.

The Colombian weasel is a carnivore. It mainly hunts fish, other small aquatic animals, and small terrestrial mammals.

Long-tailed weasel

The long-tailed weasel ("Mustela frenata"), is a type of mustelid. It is also called the bridled weasel or big stoat. It lives in southern Canada throughout all the United States and Mexico, through all of Central America and northern South America.

Males are 330 and 420 mm (12–16 in) long. Females are 280–350 mm (11–13 in) long. In males, the tail is 132–294 mm (5–11 in) long. In females, the tail is 112 to 245 mm (4–9 in) long. Long-tailed weasels weighs between 3 and 9 ounces (85-267 g) with males being about twice as large as the females.

The summer fur is brown, with whitish underparts and tinged with yellowish or buffy brown. The tail has a black tip. In northern areas, the winter fur becomes white, sometimes with yellow tints, but the tail still have its black tip. The long-tailed weasel moults two times each year, once in autumn (October to mid-November) and once in spring (March–April). The bottom of the long-tailed weasel's feet has no fur in summer. Unlike skunks, which spray their musk, the long-tailed weasel drags and rubs its body over surfaces, to mark their territory and, when scared, to scare predators away.

The long-tailed weasel lives in most of North America, south to Central America to northern South America. Long-tailed weasels have the largest distribution of any mustelid in the Western Hemisphere.

Long-tailed weasels are found in temperate and tropical habitats in North and Central America. These habitats range from crop fields to small places with lots of trees to suburban areas. They are not found in deserts or thick forests. Their burrows and nests are in hollow logs, rock piles, and under barns. Sometimes instead of making a new nest, long-tailed weasels take the burrow of the animal they have killed.

Long-tailed weasels live by themselves except during the mating season. Long-tailed weasels do not like other long-tailed weasels to enter their home range.

Long-tailed weasels are fast and agile. They are good climbers and swimmers. Long-tailed weasels hunt their prey by smell or sound.

While long-tailed weasels can be active during the day, they are more active at night. These weasels are also known to be noisy animals, but this usually means that they are disturbed.

The long-tailed weasel is a carnivore. It may attack animals far larger than itself. It hunts small animals, such as mice. It also hunts large animals, such as rabbits. Long-tailed weasels help to control populations of rodents and rabbits.

The long-tailed weasel likes its prey to be fresh or alive. It only eats the carrion stored in its burrows. Its mainly hunts animals such as mice, rats, squirrels, chipmunks, shrews, moles and rabbits. Sometimes, it may eat small birds, bird eggs, reptiles, amphibians, fish, earthworms and some insects. The long-tailed weasel has also been seen eating bats. It sometimes kill animals in big numbers, usually in spring when the kits are being fed, and again in autumn. Some of the surplus kills may be stored, but are usually left uneaten. When stealing eggs, the long-tailed weasel removes each egg from its nest one at a time. It carries them in its mouth to a safe place. It bites off the top and licks out the fluids in the egg. If they have babies in the burrow they may hold it in their mouth all the way back to them.

They may be hunted by larger animals, such as large owls, coyotes, or large snakes, such as eastern massasauga rattlesnakes.

The long-tailed weasel mates in July–August. The gestation period lasts 10 months. Long-tailed weasels give birth to 5–8 kits, which are born in April–May.

The kits are born partially naked and blind. At birth, they weigh 3 grams. Long-tailed weasels grow fast. By the age of three weeks, the kits have lots of fur. They can crawl outside the nest and eat meat. At five weeks of age, the kit's eyes open, and the young become active. At this stage, the kits are weaned. The kits are fully grown by autumn. They leave the family at this time. The females are able to breed at 3–4 months of age. Males become sexually mature at 15–18 months.

The fur of long-tailed weasels were available in the fur trade but were not a popular commodity. Long-tailed weasels are good at catching rats and mice, so farmers do not mind having weasels around their farms because they kill these pests. Long-tailed weasels are known to take poultry from poultry farms.

Spaghetti Junction

Spaghetti Junction is a motorway interchange in Birmingham, England. It is junction 6 of the M6 motorway. 

The junction's official name is Gravelly Hill Interchange, but this name is not used very often. The junction links the M6 with the A38(M) motorway which passes through Birmingham. The interchange was opened in 24 May 1972, and was given its popular name by local journalists.

The junction covers 30 acres, serves 18 routes and includes 4 km (2.5 miles) of slip roads. There are five levels, and it flies over two railway lines, three canals and two rivers. It took nearly four years to build it, against an estimated three years. It cost £8 million, which is a deceptively small amount. It can only be understood by realising the extent of monetary inflation during the past half century.

The junction has had a lot of repair work done a number of times since it was built. There is very heavy traffic through the junction, and there were some alleged cost-saving measures during its construction.

Neshat Jahandari

Neshat Jahandari is an Iranian pilot. She is the first female captain of a McDonnell Douglas MD-80 based in Tehran, Iran. She is the second Iranian woman to qualify as a commercial airline pilot. 

She has flown 3000 thousand hours and is the youngest and only MD80 female captain of the Iranian airline. After qualifying as an airline captain, the company's video went viral. 

Another fame wave came when she made history being the Captain of the first all-female-crew operating a flight from Tehran to the northeastern city of Mashhad.

The departing flight from the capital Tehran to Mashhad in northeast Iran was done with 160 passengers on Monday, and the return flight carried 171 passengers.

Captain Jahandari posted about the news on her Instagram page, describing it as a “historic event” in Iran’s aviation industry.

Pilot Neshat Jahandari became Iran's first female certified captain in July 2019. Awarded four stripes, she is qualified to take full control of an aircraft, either on her own or supported by a copilot. In an industry still largely closed to women in the Islamic Republic, this is a significant achievement.

She began to work with Zagros Airlines in the field of flight safety and the review of Flight Data Monitoring. About three and a half years later, the company needed a pilot; she passed the test and was accepted with merit.

At the age of 17, she began her pilot training classes, and at the same time studied at the University. She received her degree in Aviation Flight Engineering Technology.

Due to her interest in this field, after receiving her license, she received all the flight-related documents for the airliners, such as the Commercial Pilot License and the Instrument Rating. Finally, her dream came true and she became a pilot.

Although, there is no that says that women cannot be pilots, it has never been easy for this to happen.

“When I entered the pilot school, many were surprised and said this is a male profession and is not suitable for me,” she says.

“This strange behavior could be a hindrance to me, but I believed in it and I was doing my job. I believe that everyone who does his/her best in every field, will certainly enjoy its result. In today’s world, as we have male professional chefs, we also have successful female mechanics engineers. Success has nothing to do with gender. Of course, it’s natural to be surprised to see a female pilot,” she noted.

Adventure game

An adventure game is a type of video game or computer game. Gameplay in adventure games is mostly exploration, solving puzzles and finishing stories. Some adventure games also have combat systems so the player can fight enemies like in an action game, beat 'em up or role-playing game, but many adventure games have no fighting in them at all. The first adventure game was "Colossal Cave Adventure" in 1975.

In adventure games, the player usually acts through a character in the story. This character sometimes has a history. For example Roger Sams in "Bad Mojo" is a sad insect scientist and Alexander in "King's Quest VI" is a prince trying to rescue a princess. Other player characters have almost no history. In "Myst" and "Zork", the game does not even give the player character a name. Other characters and the game's voice call the player "you."

Adventure games can be played on computers, for example PCs and Macs. Adventure games can be played on consoles, for example Playstations and Xboxes.

Many adventure games are called point-and-click adventure games because the player uses a computer mouse to click on things on the screen. Not all adventure games do this. In the 1996 game "Bad Mojo", the player can only use the computer's arrow keys. In the 1977 game "Zork", the player must write commands using the keyboard.

Because they are about exploration, adventure games usually have an interesting world setting. Some games have art with painted graphics. Others show off the newest image-making technology, for example "Myst". Other games, like the early "Zork" games, had no graphics at all. The "Zork" games told the player what was happening using words.

Some famous adventure game series are "Myst" by Brøderbund, "Monkey Island" by LucasArts, and the "King's Quest" and "Quest for Glory" series by Sierra on-line.

The modern fish fry is strong in Wisconsin. In the state, hundreds of eateries have a fish fry on Fridays and sometimes on Wednesdays. The Friday night fish fry is a popular tradition for religious and "non"-religious people alike. Fish fries in Wisconsin are usually offered at many non-chain restaurants, some chain restaurants and at Roman Catholic churches as fundraisers.

Batter (cooking)

Batter is thin dough that can be easily poured into a pan. Batter is used mainly for pancakes, light cakes and as the coating for some fried foods. The word "batter" comes from a French word "battre". "Battre" means beat. Many batters require vigorous beating or whisking in their preparation.

A number of batters are made by combining dry flour with liquids, like eggs, milk and water. Often, a leavening agent such as baking powder is included to fluff up the batter while it cooks. The mixture may be naturally fermented for this actual purpose, as well as to add flavor.

The viscosity of batter may be from very 'heavy" to "thin". Heat is applied to the batter, often by frying, baking or steaming in order to cook the ingredients and to "set" the batter in a solid form.

Beer is a popular ingredient in batters used to coat food before frying. One reason is that a basic batter can be made from flour, beer and some salt. The purpose of using beer is so the bubbles in the beer will add lightness and body to the batter. The practice of beer battering is popular in several countries, including the United States, Iceland, Germany and Australia.

European mink

The European mink ("Mustela lutreola"), is a semiaquatic type of mustelid. It is also called the Russian mink and Eurasian mink. It is native to Europe.

The European mink has a very long body with short limbs. The European mink has a large, wide head with short ears. The mink's tail is short. Males are 373–430 mm (14.7–16.9 in) long. Females are 352–400 mm (13.9–15.7 in) long. The tail is 153–190 mm (6.0–7.5 in) in males. It is 150–180 mm (5.9–7.1 in) in females. It weighs 550–800 grams (1.21–1.76 lb). It is a fast and agile animal. It is great at swimming. It is able to run along stream beds. It can stay underwater for one to two minutes.

The winter fur, is very thick and dense. The fur is not long. The summer fur is a little bit shorter, hairier and less dense than the winter fur. In dark coloured European minks, the fur is dark brown or almost blackish-brown. Lighter European minks are reddish brown.

European minks are found in Northeast Spain and France and throughout Europe to the Irtysh and Ob Rivers.

The European mink lives in densely shaded banks of fresh water creeks, rivers, and lakes. The European minks may make their own burrows. They may live in the burrow of a water vole. They may live in cracks among root of trees.

The European mink eats different animals that lives in aquatic and riparian habitats. Voles are the most important source of food for the European mink. It also eats crustaceans, frogs and water insects. Fish are an important food source in floodlands. When there is a lot of food, it stores its food.

The mating season happens from February to March. The gestation period is 35–72 days. The kits are given birth to in April and May. They give birth to three to seven kits. At birth, kits weigh about 6.5 grams (0.23 oz), and grow fast. They are born blind; the eyes open after 30–31 days. The kits suck milk for 2.0 to 2.5 months, even though the kits eat solid food after 20–25 days. They follow their mother to hunt by the age of 56–70 days. They leave the family at the age 70–84 days.

European mink populations have been decreasing because of ecological and commercial reasons. They are now listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. The main reason is capturing them for their fur. Another reason for the decline is water pollution and hydroelectric dams. Efforts to bring European minks to the Kuril Islands and Tajikistan have begun.

Croatia Records

Croatia Records is the largest record label in Croatia, based in Zagreb.

Croatia Records d.d. is a company led by Želimir Babogredac, an important sound engineer. It releases mostly (but not all) mainstream music, and it has had many popular Croatian musicians of many music genres such as Dražen Zečić, Arsen Dedić, Mišo Kovač, Josipa Lisac, Goran Bare, Teška industrija, Thompson, Maksim Mrvica, Crvena jabuka, Jelena Rozga, Novi fosili, Opća opasnost, Rade Šerbedžija, Jacques Houdek, Parni valjak, Leteći odred, Mladen Grdović, Dino Dvornik, Dino Merlin, Hari Rončević, Adastra, Radojka Šverko, Klapa Sveti Florijan, Giuliano, Dječaci, Mate Bulić, Disciplin a Kitschme, Srebrna krila, Divlje jagode, Bosutski bećari, Indexi, Sinan Alimanović, Lu Jakelić, Mia Dimšić, Mia Negovetić, Nina Donelli and others. Today, Croatia Records claims to have a 70% share of the Croatian music market and has 30 record stores. Being a successor of Jugoton, from which it gained a very large audio and video collection, Croatia Records is also active in re-releasing numerous digitally remastered former Yugoslav pop and rock titles. During the global retro trend, the company decided to re-introduce gramophone records as well.

The company that is today Croatia Records was founded in 1947 in Zagreb, the capital of the then-People's Republic of Croatia under the name Jugoton, a publicly owned company which was the largest record label and chain record store in the former SFR Yugoslavia. Jugoton signed many popular Yugoslav artists such as: Indexi, Bijelo Dugme, Električni Orgazam, Haustor, Idoli and Leb i Sol, and also many popular foreign stars for the Yugoslav market including: Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Madonna, U2, David Bowie, Queen, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Iron Maiden, Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode etc. The company also owned a chain of record shops across Yugoslavia. Many Yugoslav entries in the Eurovision Song Contest were signed with Jugoton, like the 1989 winners Riva.

After the change from socialist state to parliamentary democracy in 1989, the question of Croatia's independence from Yugoslavia was raised. In 1991, shortly before the declaration of Croatian independence and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the company's name Jugoton, a portmanteau word of "Jugoslavija" (Yugoslavia) and "tone", was changed to Croatia Records. Parallelly, the major labels in Serbia and Slovenia such as PGP RTB and ZKP RTLJ were renamed to PGP-RTS and ZKP RTVS. The company was now owned by the independent Republic of Croatia, but since socialism had ended, it was sold off to private owners. Since the year of 2000, Croatia Records is ran by professionals from the music industry who are in the partnership company called AUTOR d.o.o. (limited company). In 2001, the musician Miroslav Škoro became the leader of Croatia Records, until his resignation in 2006.

Croatia Records Music Publishing (CRMP d.o.o.) is a company owned by Croatia Records d.d. that works in the managing of rules for the use of copyrighted music and its digital sale.

Founded in 1947 as part of Jugoton, today Croatia Records Music Publishing is its own company. Croatia Records Music Publishing has the largest catalog of Croatian songs and the largest catalog of master recordings made in the last 40 years of the most famous Croatian singers such as Arsen Dedić, Đorđe Novković, Damir Urban, Nenad Ninčević, Zlatan Stipišić - Gibonni, Zdenko Runjić.

Often, the company was a target of public complaint on various issues.

Croatia Records has been the object of an issue raised by singer Branimir Štulić over royalty rights. Štulić claims that the royalties of songs by former rock band Azra, of which he was the lead singer in the 1980s, and which was then managed by Jugoton. Štulić has named a sum of 12 million Euros that he thinks Croatia Records owes him, but he has not tried to take legal action to claim it. Želimir Babogredac said in response that Croatia Records has all the legal rights to release titles by Štulić and Azra, as the company is a direct successor of Jugoton, whom these artists were signed for. He also said that the sum Štulić claims is too large. However, he added that Croatia Records is proud to have the very popular Štulić in the list of its artists and that he may receive a payment from the sale of audio CDs only if he joins the Croatian Composers' Society - .



Thompson (band)

Thompson is a Croatian ethno band, founded by Marko Perković aka "Thompson", often thought of as the same as the band itself. "Thompson" is Perković's stage name. He is the songwriter and lead vocalist. The members of the band, aside from him, are Tomislav Mandarić, Ivan Ivanković, Duje Ivić, and Ivica Bilić Ike.

The band name originates from the Thompson submachine gun, a nickname given to Perković while he fought in the Croatian War of Independence. Although mostly formed in Čavoglave, Thompson is currently based in Zagreb. Thompson came to be popular during the Croatian war in 1991, with the release of the first single "Bojna Čavoglave", which is about the Croatian participation in the Yugoslav Wars and was included in the compilation album "Rock za Hrvatsku". This song, with slightly different lyrics, named "Branitelji Sarajeva", was sung by the BiH Army during the Siege of Sarajevo ("Sarajevo zaboravit neće nikada"). During the 1990s Thompson became popular in Croatia with the release of the first album "Moli mala" in 1992. They later became popular again with the hit "Prijatelji" in 1998. 

In 2002, Thompson started their first major tour to promote the album "E, moj narode". This tour continued on and off until 2005, and included concerts at the Sydney Entertainment Centre and Melbourne's Vodafone Arena. In May 2005, the album was declared a Diamond Record with more than 60,000 copies sold. Touring continued in 2006 with "Bilo jednom u Hrvatskoj", again performing internationally with concerts in Germany, Sweden, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

Thompson features annually at the Homeland Victory celebrations in their hometown of Čavoglave. These performances are attended by as many as 60,000 to 100,000 viewers, and feature Croatian singers like Mate Bulić, Dražen Zečić, Ivan Mikulić, and Baruni. The band has became controversial for its alleged praise of the World War Two Nazi-affiliated Ustaše regime in their songs and concerts.


Jugoton

Jugoton was the largest record label and chain record store in the former Yugoslavia based in Zagreb, SR Croatia.

Jugoton was created in 1947. It released some of the most important former Yugoslav pop and rock records. The company also owned a large network of record shops across SFR Yugoslavia.

After the break-up of Yugoslavia began, the company changed its name to Croatia Records in 1991.

Jugoton signed many famous former Yugoslav pop and rock acts. Some of the artists that have been signed to Jugoton include:


Jugoton also released the popular compilation album "Paket aranžman". Many artists that represented Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest were signed with Jugoton, including the 1989 winners Riva.

Like other former Yugoslav labels, Jugoton also had a licence to release foreign titles for the Yugoslav market including notable international popular music stars such as: Rick Astley, The Beatles, David Bowie, Kate Bush, Deep Purple, Eurythmics, Iron Maiden, Kraftwerk, John Lennon, Madonna, Gary Moore, Mötley Crüe, Elvis Presley, Pink Floyd, Public Image Limited, Queen, The Rolling Stones, Scorpions, U2, Whitesnake, Kim Wilde and others.

Other major labels in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were: PGP-RTB and Jugodisk from Belgrade; Suzy from Zagreb; Diskoton from Sarajevo; ZKP RTLJ from Ljubljana and others.

Jugoton, as an important part of the former Yugoslav culture is one of the subjects of Yugonostalgia.

The former Jugoton record shop in the main shopping mall in Skopje ("Gradski Trgovski Centar"), North Macedonia, still operates under the same name managed by the Macedonian record label Lithium Records.

An example of different kind is the online radio and web tv station called Jugoton which operates in the Yugoslav diaspora in Vienna, Austria. It plays music from the former Yugoslavia, but also from all the contemporary former Yugoslav countries, including pop, rock and folk. However, it is not formally related to the actual Jugoton, and not all the Yugoslav artists represented in its program were really signed to the label.

"Yugoton" is a Polish tribute album to the former Yugoslav rock scene released in 2001. Its title is a nod to Jugoton.

Murder of Kitty Genovese

On March 13, 1964, 28-year-old Kitty Genovese was mugged and stabbed to death outside her apartment building on Austin Street, in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens in New York City, United States. 

Two weeks after the murder, "The New York Times" published an article claiming that 38 witnesses saw or heard the attack, and that none of them called the police or came to her aid, apart from her neighbour Sophia Farrar.

The incident was the bystander effect or "Genovese syndrome," and the murder became a well known example of U.S. psychology textbooks. Genovese syndrome is when witnesses to a crime to not report a crime because they are scared and they believe that others will report it instead which in the end they do not and the crime goes unreported. 

However, this is not really what happened. Police interviews showed that the other people nearby either attempted to call the police or were afraid to be involved. This was before calling 911 was easy to do in the United States. Because Genovese was killed late at night, many of the people nearby were asleep. Some of the people who saw the attack also saw Genovese get up and walk away, so they did not think she had been badly hurt.

Winston Moseley, a 29-year-old man from Manhattan, was arrested during a house burglary six days after the murder. While in custody, he confessed to killing Genovese. At his trial, Moseley was found guilty. He died in prison on March 28, 2016.

AA was founded by Bill Wilson and his physician, Doctor Bob Smith in 1935 and eventually grew to include two more groups by 1939. That same year, Wilson published Alcoholics Anonymous, a text which explained its philosophy and methods. We know it today as the 12 Steps of recovery. Over the years, the 12 Steps have been adapted by other self-help and addiction recovery groups, such as Gamblers Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, to those struggling with other forms of addiction. Additionally, many groups have changed the explicitly Christian overtones of the original 12 Steps to reflect more secular or agnostic philosophies.

Shovel Knight

Shovel Knight is an indie 2D platform game made by Yacht Club Games in 2014. The money needed to make the game came from Kickstarter. It first came out on the Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and Microsoft Windows. It later came out on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, OS X, and Linux. The game's gameplay and looks are based on other 2D platformers from the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).

The game has received many good reviews, has won many awards, and often shows up on best video games of all time lists. The game is even responsible for expanding the indie game market for Nintendo consoles. Before "Shovel Knight", Nintendo mostly released first-party and mainstream video games on its own consoles, but since the Wii U was struggling to sell, it allowed Nintendo to be more open to playing indie games on their own consoles. "Shovel Knight"'s success on Nintendo's consoles them more popular to make indie games for.

The game later added four more campaigns, or separate stories and/or game modes within the game, which are "Plague of Shadows", "Specter of Torment", "King of Cards", and "Shovel Knight: Showdown". These all were sold together as "Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove." The first campaign was later renamed "Shovel of Hope".

The player plays as Shovel Knight, a knight who carries a shovel rather than a normal weapon like a sword or a spear. The player will use the shovel for fighting enemies, jumping on platforms, and digging up treasure and secrets. There is no game over if the player dies in a level, but they will return to the last checkpoint they turned on and lose about one-fourth of all the Gold they have, the game's currency. Like in "Dark Souls", the player will have one life to take back the Gold they lost, but if they die before taking back their lost Gold, the lost Gold will disappear forever. The player can destroy checkpoints to get more Gold, but in turn, the player will have to start at an earlier part of the level if they die. At the end of the main levels, the player will have to fight a boss, usually an enemy knight, to complete the level.

Gold is used to make the player's armor and shovel better, buy more health or magic, or buy Relics (useful items that use magic). Most of the main levels (the levels that have an level-end boss and are needed to complete the story) have a Relic hidden in the level that the player can buy. Relics can help with platforming, protect the player, or help the player fight enemies.

The game has a game world similar to that of "Super Mario Bros. 3" where the player can play some levels in an order they want, but must complete certain levels before they can unlock more parts of the game world. Also like "SMB3", there are some bosses called the Wandering Knights who can walk around the game world, and they will start a boss fight if you walk into them. There are main levels, levels that teach the player how to use a Relic, and towns similar to those in "" and "". In towns, the player can shop for upgrades and Relics, and talk to villagers for tips on how to play the game.

The game's story begins with Shovel Knight and Shield Knight, who is Shovel Knight's partner and love interest. When they went to the Tower of Fate to take a magical amulet, Shield Knight disappears. Afterwards, Shovel Knight mourns the loss of Shield Knight and retires from being a knight. This leaves the land defenseless and allows an evil sorceress called the Enchantress and a group of evil knights called the Order of No Quarter to take over the land. Shovel Knight then comes out of retirement to defeat the Enchantress and the Order and save the land.

After every knight of the Order Shovel Knight defeats, he sleeps by a campfire. Sometimes, he dreams of catching Shield Knight falling from the sky while fighting off enemies. 

As Shovel Knight travels the land to defeat the Order, he sometimes meets and fights his rival, Black Knight. Black Knight is not part of the Order, but he wants to protect the Enchantress, who Shovel Knight later discovers to be Shield Knight. She became the Enchantress because she was being controlled by the evil amulet from the Tower of Fate.

During Shovel Knight's fight with the Enchantress, Shield Knight is set free from the amulet's control, but the amulet takes on a stronger form. Shield Knight then helps Shovel Knight fight the amulet. However, the amulet hurts Shovel Knight badly and Shovel Knight passes out. Before the amulet could kill Shovel Knight, Shield Knight blocks its attack with her shield. Black Knight then shows up and warns Shield Knight to escape, but she tells him she must destroy the amulet even if she must die doing it. Shield Knight requests Black Knight to take safely Shovel Knight out of the tower. Black Knight does not want to save Shovel Knight, but he obeys Shield Knight because of his own love for her. As the tower is falling down, Black Knight places Shovel Knight by a campfire. As Shovel Knight is sleeping, the cutscene that Shield Knight survives the fight with the amulet. The game ends with a hurt Shield Knight slowly walking towards the campfire and lying next to a sleeping Shovel Knight.

Plant reproduction

Plant reproduction is the production of new plants. It can be done by sexual or asexual reproduction. 

Sexual reproduction results in offspring with genetics from both parents. Asexual reproduction produces new individuals genetically identical to the parent plants, except when mutations occur. Plants can do asexual reproduction in many more ways than animals. These are some of the ways:

Plants have ways they may get clones of the parent plant. Any piece of a plant "may" be used to grow a whole plant. This is called vegetative reproduction. 

These are all natural methods of vegetative reproduction. Also there are many ways in which humans can get copies (clones) of a plant, mainly by taking "cuttings" and using grafting.

Pietro Pinna

Pietro Pinna (5 January 1927 - 13 April 2016) was an Italian non-violence activist. He is considered the first person against military service in Italy.

He was born in Finale Ligure, from Sardinia. Pinna lived in Ferrara when, at the end of 1948, he was drafted. Becoming strongly anti-militarist after experiencing the horrors of the Second World War, and influenced by the thought of Aldo Capitini, he decided to refuse military service, going down in history as the first conscientious objector of Italy for political reasons.

After a trial for disobedience (art. 173 military criminal code of peace ) , he was sentenced to prison for a first time for ten months, and then for another eight. At the trial he was defended by the lawyer Bruno Segre, who became one of the most famous Italian defenders in the field of conscientious objection.

Thanks to the echo given by Capitini to his disobedience, the case took on international significance. Pinna received a telegram of support from the First Lady Wilson. The daughter of Leone Tolstoy, Tatiana Tolstoy Suhotin , wrote that she had "cried with joy reading what these brave young people are doing". In addition, twenty-three British parliamentarians, chaired by the Labor Reverend Reginald W. Sorensen, signed a letter addressed to Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi to intercede on his behalf.

Pinna later became one of Capitini's closest collaborators, with whom he organized the first Perugia-Assisi March for Peace in 1961. He continued to work in the nonviolent movement throughout his life, becoming national secretary from 1968 to 1976. He was editor in chief of the magazine "Nonviolent Action" until his death.

He risked jail for his nonviolent actions. On 17 January 1973, former secretary of the Nonviolent Movement , following a posting against the celebration of the Armed Forces on 4 November ("Not a party but mourning"), he was arrested in Perugia and sentenced for direct contempt of the Armed Forces. Following the demonstrations that took place in his support in various cities, he was freed four weeks later at the request of clemency by the President of the Republic Giovanni Leone.

In April 1979 he was sentenced by the Court of Appeal of Trieste to an 8-month prison sentence for a roadblock, a sentence which was later pardoned.

He was among the organizers of the Catania-Comiso March (24 December 1982 - 3 January 1983) to protest against the installation of the US missile base, the first concrete action of nonviolent struggle against military installations in Italy.

In 2008 he was awarded the National Nonviolence Award.

In 2012 the Faculty of Law of the University of Pisa awarded him an honorary degree in Peace Sciences.

Pietro Pinna died on April 13, 2016 in Florence.

Tuscan Grand Prix

The 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Pirelli Gran Premio della Toscana Ferrari 1000 2020) was a Formula One motor race held on 13 September 2020 at the Autodromo Internazionale del Mugello in Scarperia e San Piero, Tuscany, Italy. The race was the ninth round of the 2020 Formula One World Championship and the first race of the season with spectators.

The race was won by Lewis Hamilton of the Mercedes team, with teammate Valtteri Bottas in second; Mercedes scored their third 1–2 finish of the season. Alexander Albon of Red Bull Racing-Honda scored his first podium in Formula One with a third-place finish, becoming the first Thai driver to do so.

The race was the first since the 2016 Brazilian Grand Prix to have two red flags. Due to the two stoppages, the race had three standing starts.

The race was held as an event celebrating Ferrari's 1000th race in the Formula One World Championship and the safety car used a red livery, instead of its usual silver colour, to mark the occasion. The Mugello Circuit hosted a World Championship Formula One race for the first time. The Ferrari SF1000 sported a special livery: instead of the traditional rosso corsa, the car was painted dark burgundy. Both Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc wore special racing overalls, and both had special helmet designs.

The championship was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the originally scheduled Grands Prix were cancelled or postponed, prompting the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile to draft a new calendar. While the previous eight events were held behind closed doors, organizers announced that up to 2,880 spectators would be allowed for the Tuscan Grand Prix.

Ten teams (each representing a different constructor) each entered two drivers. The drivers and teams were the same as those on the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for either the race or practice.

Sole Formula One tyre manufacturer Pirelli brought the C1, C2, and C3 compound tyres for teams to use in the race, the three hardest compounds available.


The race was marked by several incidents. On the first lap at turn 2, Max Verstappen, Pierre Gasly, Kimi Räikkönen, and Romain Grosjean collided, resulting in Gasly and Verstappen retiring from the race and Räikkönen having to change his front wing. Verstappen's car was beached in the gravel trap. A separate incident at the same corner involved Carlos Sainz Jr. and Lance Stroll, as Sainz spun round and damaged Sebastian Vettel's front wing. These incidents together brought out the safety car. On lap 6 the safety car pulled in, but an accordion effect led the midfield drivers to accelerate up to racing speed before the leaders did and were forced to brake, triggering a collision involving Sainz, Kevin Magnussen, Antonio Giovinazzi, and Nicholas Latifi. Grosjean blamed the leader, Valtteri Bottas, for causing the accordion effect, and stated "this is the worst thing I've seen ever." All four drivers retired from the race and the red flag was brought out. During the red flag period, Esteban Ocon retired due to a brake failure; George Russell had earlier reported Ocon's brakes being on fire. The second red flag came on lap 45, after Stroll suffered a tyre failure at lap 43 turn 9, and went into the barrier. His Racing Point RP20 caught on fire, making it harder for the marshalls to clear the track.

Lewis Hamilton won the race, his 90th career win. Valtteri Bottas came in second and Alex Albon finished third; his first career podium. By finishing in ninth place, Kimi Räikkönen scored his first points of the season. A poor restart after the second red flag meant George Russell slipped from ninth to 12th and last. He eventually finished 11th leaving him out of the points. Twelve drivers were warned by the FIA for their part in the accident at the restart on lap 6. Writing for the BBC, former GP2 Series champion Jolyon Palmer praised the circuit, saying that it "defied all the [Hermann] Tilke design theories and yet provided a great spectacle in the traditional sense."

She showed signs of Steatopygia; which means she had a lot of fat in her buttocks. Around 1810, she was brought to Europe. She was one of at least two Khoikoi women, who were shown at freak shows. In English she became known as Hottentot Venus. At the time, people believed there were different races of humans. Hottentot was the term used to refer to the Khoikoi people, as a race. Today, many consider it to be racist. 

From about 1810, Baartman performed for upper-class people in London. She danced, sang and played an instrument, called Ramkie. The Ramkie is a kind of lute with 3 or 4 chords that was popular in South Africa at the time. The African Institution, led by Zachary Macaulay offered to bring Sarah Baaerman back to South Africa, but she declined. It is unknown if she was put under pressure, or if she declined because in South Africa her people were persecuted (much like a modern-day genocide). She may also have liked the performances. There was a court hearing, done in Dutch; there she said that she wasn't forced to do anything. She also said that she had been promised half the earnings from her show. 

The court hearing had drawn too much attention, and she could no longer perform in London. Hendrick Caezar, her manager at the time, moved to the English countryside, with his "freak." Reverend Joshua Brooks baptized her on December 1, 1811, in a church in Manchester. In 1814. she came to Paris with another manager. There, mostly scientists were interested. She was presented to the audience, mostly of doctors and scientists, in the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris. Professional portraits were done. She died, presumably of pneumonia, on December 29, 1815. 

Georges Cuvier prepared her corpse: The skeleton, the brain, and her genitals were preserved. A gypsum plaster model was made of her body. All of these are preserved in what is the Musée de l'Homme in Paris, today.

Stephen Jay Gould and Élisabeth de Fontenay pointed out that these exhibitions were sexist, and focused on their own people ("ethnocenric"), in 1982. President Nelson Mandela asked that the remains of Sarah Baartman be given back to South Africa. At first, French academics refused. It was only in 2002, that her remains were given back. There was a large funeral in "Hankey" at the River Gamtoos in the area of "Baviaanskloof", on 9. August 2002. Thabo Mbeki, who was the president of South Africa at the time, gave the funeral speech. The district Cacadu, where her grave is was renamed to Sarah Baartman, in her honor, in 2015.

In December 2007, the Library of Congress selected "Three Little Pigs" (1933) to placed in the United States National Film Registry.

Big Bad Wolf

The Big Bad Wolf is a wolf and a fictional villain in many fairy tales, such as "The Boy Who Cried Wolf", "Little Red Riding Hood" and "The Three Little Pigs".

Medieval people did not like wolves because wolves would eat their sheep and other animals, so sometimes the big bad wolf in the story is supposed to be a wolf and does not represent anything else. But other times the wolf is symbol for something else. There are two main ways to look at symbols in "Little Red Riding Hood": In one, the girl Riding Hood is a symbol for the sun. She is eaten by the wolf, who is a symbol for winter or night. Little Red Riding Hood escaping from the wolf's belly is like the sun rising again the next day or spring coming again the next year. In the other, the wolf represents sex or rape. In French around the time "Little Red Riding Hood"' was written down, the figure of speech "she has seen the wolf" means "she has had sex and is not a virgin any more."





There are also modern versions of the Big Bad Wolf. For example, in the graphic novel series "Fables", Bigby Wolf lives with other fairy tale characters who have run away to the real world and works as a detective.

The theme of the film is a knight's return to his country at the time of the Black Death, that is, the plague in Europe of the Middle Ages.

Green-eyed tree frog

The green-eyed tree frog, brown-spotted tree frog, fringed tree frog or New Guinea tree frog ("Ranoidea genimaculata") is a tree frog from New Guinea. It lives everywhere on the island except high in the mountains. It lives in both Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, no more than 1500 meters above sea level. It also lives in Queensland, Australia, near the Great Barrier Reef, but some scientists think these are really two different species. Scientists who think they are one species call the frogs in New Guinea and Australia "Litoria genimaculata" and scientists who think they are two different species call the New Guinea frogs "genimaculata" and the Australian frogs "serrata". Some scientists think the group of frogs in Australia is really two different species, "serrata" and "myola", for three altogether.

The adult male frog is 4.6 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 7.1 cm long. Each frog has a bright green ring around its eyes, which is why it is called "green-eyed tree frog" in English. It has a brown-green body with patches of color that look like lichen that grows on wet rocks. That way, the frog can hide from larger animals that want to eat it. The frog has very large discs on its toes for climbing. This frog has a bit of skin on its hind legs that looks like fringe. That is why it is also called "fringed tree frog" in English.

This frog lives near streams with rocks in them. The male frogs tend to stay near the water, and the female frogs climb high into the trees. The female frog lays eggs in pools, many hundreds at a time.

This frog has colors that look like an hourglass on its back. Scientists thought they could take photographs of this frog to identify individual frogs, but the hourglass changes shape as the frog grows older.

This frog is not endangered now, but scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis or a virus may have killed many of them.

Roma people in Turkey

In English they are named "Turkish Gypsy". The Word Gypsy is not pejorative for them. There are a number of subgroups, all named after their old professional jobs or only Xoraxane. There Religion is Sunni Muslim of Hanafi school and some are Members of a Sufism Tarika. Engagement's, marriage's, and circumcision of the boys (Sünnet party)'s, are big festivals.
The Roma people in Turkey speak the Turkish language as first language. Most do not speak the Romani language anymore, and many hide there Romani Background designate themselves as Turks only, and didn't want to be call as Roma. The majority live in East Thrace, this is why East Thrace is jokily called "Gypsy County"' (Şoparistan), and Citys like Istanbul, Edirne and Izmir. They have Turkish citizenship and adopted the Turkish culture, they havent Romanipen (a special Romani culture-code etc.), like christian roma in europe. The Romanlar from Turkey distance themselves from all other Roma groups from europe, it doesnt matter if they are Christian or Muslims.
The Romanlar are closer to Turks as to any Roma Groups of Europe. They have only a lesser similarity with the Turkish speaking Xoraxane Roma from Bulgaria, Romani (Dobruja) or Greece (West-Thrace). They also havent an Minority status, and they didnt want to be called as Minority. Some of the Turkish Romani came as Guest worker to Germany and Austria in the 1960-70's. None of them was looked as Roma by the Host Population, only as Turks in Germany, where some of the Turkish-Romani Men married with German or Austrian Womans. The Offsprings of this Marriages called Melezi (Halfblood), a Turkish Loanword in the Romani language dialects of the Muslim Roma for people with mixed Romani blood.

There is recorded by Persian poets and historians in the Shahnameh. According to this records, the Persian king Bahram V of Sassanid Empire, brought several thousand musicians from India to Persia. From Persia, the descendants of the Indian musicians migrated to different countries.
According Ottoman and Turkish historians and linguists, the Romanlar in Turkey are the descendants of mixed Ancestry, the so called Chingan (Musicans-Dancers), who once came from Hindustan, trough trading relationships at the Silk Road with the Byzantine Empire, from the Indian subcontinent into Egypt, who was at that time a part of the Byzantine Empire. They settled in Koptos (Qift) at the Nile for a while. Later, when the Muslim Arabian made fight with the Byzantine Empire, the Romanlar went with them as Camp followers to Asia Minor and settled first in Phrygia, from there they went to Thrace in Europe at 800 AD. The Greeks called them Atsingani. The oldest sedentary settlment of Romanlar was in Sulukule in Istanbul, dating back to 1054 AD. The Byzantine Historian Nikephoros Gregoras, told of Acrobats who came from Egypt to Constantinople in 1322. The Ottoman Historian Evliya Çelebi described in his Book Seyhatnâme, the language and Background of the Roma people, that after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, Sultan Mehmed II settled Roma from Gümülcine and Muslim Roma's from Bayat village Aydın Province and Sanjak of Menteşe to Istanbul as Dancers and Musicians. At the time of Ottoman Empire they got their own Sanjak (district) in East Thrace in 1530 by the Order of Suleiman the Magnificent. Turkish speaking Muslim Roma also settled from Anatolia in the Balkans under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. Today in Bulgaria, Greece (West-Thrace) and Romania (Dobruja) there live a Turkish speaking Muslim Roma minority. Many Romanlar live in Istanbul , Edirne and İzmir.

Genetic studies showed that Turkish Gypsys have similarity to Jats and Punjabis from Punjab (Pakistan) also Gene flow from Turks and Southeast Europe's people like Slavs, Greeks and Albanians into the Turkish Gypsys population of the Ottoman Empire, happend trough the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. Also people from Caucasus Mountains like the Kubachi people 

About Paspati in his Book of the Turkish Gypsy's from 1860-1863, he mentioned that Ottoman Turkish Men often married Gypsy woman, and arround 200.000 Muslim Roma live in Turkey. Under the reign of Abdulhamid II, there status was changend and they was named as Buçuk Millet.

At the Greek War of Independence 1821–1829, Crimean War 1853–1856, Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), Balkan Wars 1912-1913, World War I 1914-1918, and the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, many Turkish speaking Xoraxane-Roma together with other Non-Romani Muslims was expelled from Bulgaria and Greece and other parts of the Balkans, who once belonged to the former Ottoman Empire, to settle in Turkey.

After the end of Serfdom-Slavery in Moldova in 1855 and Wallachia in 1856, Orthodox Christian Roma went to Istanbul and named Laxo Roma who speak Vlax Romani language. In 1923 the Laxo went mostly to Greece.

The Romanlar in Turkey are wellknown of there Music and Dance, and play for Weddings, Sünnet partys and Kirkpinar-Festival (Oil wrestling), also for Non Romani People. Belly dance is performed in there own special style.

Kakava is the name of the celebration of there own Male Saint Baba Fingo., its hold every year on 5-6 May at Edirne. Its an old Folk Believe by the Romanlar,

He was original a Muslim from Hindustan. Anyway the Romanlar are Muslims, the old Folk believe of Baba Fingo is present.

Serbian Americans

Serbian Americans (), also known as American Serbs (), are United States citizens whose ancestors are Serbs. As of 2013, there were about 190,000 American citizens who said that they had Serb ancestry. However, the number may be much higher, as there were also 290,000 people who said that they were Yugoslavs living in the United States. The group includes Serbian Americans living in the United States for one or many generations, people who are citizens of both Serbia and the United States, or any other people who say that they are both Serbian and American.

One of the first Serb immigrants to the United States was the settler George Fisher, who came to Philadelphia in 1815, moved to Mexico, fought in the Texan Revolution, and became a judge in California. Another important early Serb in America was Basil Rosevic, who started a shipping company, the Trans-Oceanic Ship Lines, around the year 1800. In the early 1800s, many Serb sailors and fishermen from Montenegro and Herzegovina came to New Orleans looking for work. In 1841, Serbs founded the Greek Orthodox parish with Greek immigrants in New Orleans.

Serbian Americans fought in the American Civil War, mostly on the side of the Confederacy, as most Serbs living in America were in Louisiana and Mississippi. A few Confederate military units were started by Serbs in Louisiana, such as the Cognevich Company (named for Stjepan Konjevic, who immigrated to Louisiana in the 1830s), and the First and Second Slavonian Rifles. At least 400 Serbs fought in these three units during the Civil War. Several other known Serbs who fought in the Civil War came from Alabama and Florida, specifically from Pensacola.

Some Serbian Americans went back to Serbia to fight in the First Balkan War. During World War I, as many as 15,000 Serbian Americans went back to the Balkans to fight. Serbs in the United States who did not fight in the war raised knowledge, campaigned for the creation of Yugoslavia, sent aid to the Balkans through the Red Cross, formed a Serbian Relief Committee, and urged important Americans to support the Serbian cause.

After World War II many Serbs immigrated to the United States from Yugoslavia after Josip Broz Tito took control of the country. Since then, many Serbian American organizations have been formed in the United States. A number of Serbian American engineers worked on the Apollo program.

Serbs have lived in Alaska since the first Serbs came to America in the 19th century. Many Serbs came in the Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1890s to earn money, just like they had done in the California Gold Rush.

The places where most Serbs settled in Alaska were Juneau, Douglas, Fairbanks, and Sitka. Many Serbs also settled in the Canadian Yukon during the gold rush as well, such as the legendary gold miner Black Mike Vojnić.

In 1893, Serbian miners in Alaska built the Orthodox Church in Juneau with the native Orthodox Tlingit people, who had been converted to Orthodoxy by the Russians decades before. During the First World War, many Serbian Americans went back to Serbia to fight, and thousands of them came from Alaska.

In recent years, it has become common for Serbian workers to come to Alaska every year to work for a few months in canneries, where food and living space is given to them. These workers stay in Alaska on temporary work visas, and speak English.

In the past, number of Serbs who immigrated to the United States was difficult to find as Serb immigrants were often recorded by their country of origin, so as Turks, Croats, Slovenes, Montenegrins, Dalmatians, Bosnians, Herzegovinians and Austro-Hungarians. In the 1910 census, there were 16,676 Serbs from Austria-Hungary, 4,321 from Serbia, and 3,724 from Montenegro.

187,738 citizens of the United States said that they Serb ethnicity in 2010. The 2012 American Community Survey estimated that there were 199,080 Americans with Serb ancestry. It is likely that some of the American citizens who said that they had Yugoslavian ethnicity (328,547 in 2010; 310,682 in 2012 estimation) are also ethnic Serbs.

Places in the United States where many Serbs have settled include Chicago, New York City, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Phoenix, and Jackson, California.

Serbian-born population in the US since 2010:


Metropolitan City of Reggio Calabria

The Metropolitan City of Reggio Calabria () is a metropolitan city in the Calabria region of southern Italy. Its capital is Reggio Calabria. It replaced the Province of Reggio Calabria in 2017.

The Aspromonte massif dominates the western part, and with its long coastline, the metropolitan city is a popular tourist destination during the summer.

The Metropolitan City was created by the reform of local authorities (Law 142/1990), and then established by the Law 56/2014.

The Metropolitan City is headed by the Metropolitan Mayor ("Sindaco metropolitano") and the Metropolitan Council ("Consiglio metropolitano").


Quasiparticle

The term Quasiparticle describes a concept in physics in which energetically excited states in matter are treated as though they are elementary quantum particles in their own right.  In fact they may be something less tangible like a vibration or a rotation.

Unlike neutrons, protons, or even atoms and molecules, quasiparticles aren't independent structures floating about on their own in free space but exist only within the structure being studied. 

For the purposes of modelling the behaviour of the excited state within the structure this treatment works very well.  

As the particles emerge from more fundamental structures they are called quasi-particles or quasiparticles.

These particles have in most cases short  lifetimes, like the magnon or the exciton. But there are also some quasi-particles with an infinite lifetime like the cooper-pair in superconductors. 

Captains Regent

The Captains Regent are the heads of state of San Marino and leaders of the government. There are always two Captains Regent and they serve terms of six months. 

Pteropus

Pteropus is a genus of large megabats. They are commonly known as fruit bats or flying foxes. They live in the tropics and subtropics of Asia: Australia, the Indian subcontinent, East Africa, and some oceanic islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. 

There are at least 60 living species in the genus.
Flying foxes eat fruit and other plant matter, and occasionally insects as well. They find food with their keen sense of smell. Most, but not all, are nocturnal. They navigate with keen eyesight, as they cannot echolocate. They have long lives and low birth rates. Females of most species have only one offspring each year. This slow birth rate makes their populations vulnerable in present-day circumstances.

Like other bats, flying foxes can give deadly diseases to humans. They are the reservoirs of rare but fatal disease agents such as Australian bat lyssavirus (which causes rabies), and Hendra virus. Seven known human deaths have come from these two diseases. Nipah virus is also transmitted by flying foxes—it affects more people, with over 100 fatalities. 

Flying foxes have cultural significance to indigenous people. They appear in traditional art, folklore, and weaponry. Their fur and teeth were used as currency in the past. Some cultures still use their teeth as currency today.

Measure word

A measure word is a word or morpheme (the smallest meaningful unit in a language) that shows how much of something there is.

In English, measure words are used to show amounts of something that cannot be easily counted, also called uncountable nouns or mass nouns. For example, a person cannot usually say, "I have three gasolines", since gasoline is not easy to count. However, a person can measure how much gasoline there is or count how many containers are used to hold gasoline. In other words, people can say, "I have three gallons of gasoline", "I have three liters of gasoline", or "I have three tanks of gasoline."

In English, count nouns are their own measure words. A person can say "I have three cars" or "cars have four wheels". The nouns do not need any extra words because the nouns themselves are easy to count. Measure words can also be used to describe groups of countable nouns. For example, a group of cattle is called "a herd of cattle" and a group of fish is called "a school of fish."

In many East Asian languages, like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, measure words must be used to count both mass nouns and count nouns. Unlike in English, a person cannot simply say "three cars" or "four wheels" in Chinese. The nouns in both phrases need a measure word. In Chinese a person must say "three (vehicle) car" (三辆车) and "four (thing) wheel" (四个轮).

Matrix function

In mathematics, a function maps an input value to an output value. In the case of a matrix function, the input and the output values are matrices. One example of a matrix function occurs with the Algebraic Riccati equation, which is used to solve certain optimal control problems. 

Matrix functions are special functions made by matrices.

Most functions like formula_1 are defined as a solution of a differential equation. But matrix functions will use a different way.

Suppose formula_2 is a complex number and formula_3 is a square matrix. If you have a polynomial:
then it is reasonable to define
Let's use this idea. When you have
then you can introduce
For example, the matrix version of the exponential function and the trigonometric functions are defined as follows:
Matrix functions are used at numerical methods for ordinary differential equations and statistics. This is why numerical analysts are studying how to compute them. For example, the following functions are studied:

Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1

The CLP-1 or () is the top division of the Tunisian Football Federation. It was created in 1921.

The football championship of Tunisia, was first held in 1907 by the "Ligue Tunisienne de football" (Tunisian League of football – LTF) then the Tunisian Football Federation (FTF). The first edition opposed the three teams of "Racing club of Tunis", "Football club of Bizerte" and "Sporting of Ferryville", and the two school teams of the "Carnot College of Tunis" and the "Sadiki College".
It became official with the creation of the LTF in 1921 and its affiliation with the French federation of football. Until 1939, the title of champion was attributed as a result of dams between the regional champions. But from 1946 to 1947, a championship of "excellence" (national division) was created and competes nationally. In 1944–1945, 1945–1946 and 1952–1953, the championship was not disputed and was replaced by a criterium (a kind of tournament pools where participation is voluntary). 
The current big clubs are created during this period: "Esperance Sportive de Tunis" (1919), "Club African" (1920), "Etoile Sportive du Sahel" (1925), "Club Athletic Bizertin" and "Club Sportif Sfaxien" (1928).

El Watania 1 and El Watania 2 have the broadcast rights of the Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1 since independence. Qatari channels Al-Kass Sports have the rights of broadcasting 10 meetings per season, most of them derby matches, since the 2015–16 season.

Trolley problem

The trolley problem is an imaginary problem that people can solve to explore how the human mind works.

Oxford University philosophy professor Philippa Foot in the 1960s wrote about the trolley problem and other problems in her 1967 essay "The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect." Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Judith Jarvis Thomson made the trolley problem famous. Now many schools teach the trolley problem. For a time, there was even a part of philosophy called trolleyology. Jarvis Thomson named the problem "the trolley problem."

The trolley problem does not have a right or wrong answer. Instead, it is a way to make people think and talk about what makes actions good or bad and why.

The agent ("you") is on a trolley, a fast-moving cart that can only run on a track. It is not an automobile that can be driven off the edge of a road. It must stay on a track. Ahead of the agent, five people are standing on the track, where the trolley will run over them and kill them. The agent has no way to stop the trolley. The only thing the agent can do is throw a switch to make the trolley change onto a different track. On this second track, there is one person. None of the six people have time to move out of the way.

In Jarvis Thomson's version, the person controlling the trolley switch is not on the trolley. Instead, this agent is watching from the side. This person can throw the switch but they can also choose to do nothing.

If the agent does nothing, the trolley will kill five people. If the agent throws the switch, the trolley will kill one person.

There are different versions of the trolley problem. What if the agent knows something about the individual people on the track?

The agent is a doctor working in an emergency room. A homeless person or traveler comes to the emergency room, but the doctor learns he is not sick at all. Upstairs in the hospital, there are five sick people who need organ transplants. The homeless person is a perfect match for all five. Like in the trolley problem, the doctor can kill one person by taking action or allow five people to die by doing nothing. The emergency room case was also in Foot's 1967 essay.

Most people think the emergency room problem is different from the trolley problem, even though the numbers are the same. The trolley problem is something that could happen in real life but would be very rare. Healthy people go to emergency rooms every day.

In the emergency room problem, many, many things can affect the agent's decision. The students say things like, "The agent is a doctor, and doctors are taught not to hurt or kill people, so the agent will say no" instead of saying what they themselves would do. Or they would say things like "If the doctors kill the homeless person, people will find out about it. They will be worried that the doctors will kill them for their organs, so they will not go to the emergency room when they need to. Then more than five people will die—sick people who did not go to the emergency room for help." These things are true, but they mean the emergency room case is very complicated for a thought experiment.

Philosophers invented the footbridge problem as a better version of the emergency room problem. Unlike in the emergency room problem, there are no societal systems that get in the way, for example the doctor's education or people deciding not to go to the emergency room.

In the footbridge problem, the agent is standing on a small bridge over a trolley track. Again, there is a trolley with no brakes moving very fast to five people. It will hit and kill the people if nothing stops it. They cannot move out of the way. There is also a second person on the footbridge. If the agent pushes this one person off the footbridge, then their body will stop the trolley, saving the five other people. But the one person whom the agent has pushed will die. In this problem, the person the agent would push is big and fat enough to stop the trolley, but the agent is not.

Other variations on the trolley problem include when the agent knows some or all of the people on the tracks. Another is when the big fat person on the footbridge put the five people on the track on purpose so they would be run over. Another is when the one person whom the trolley can run over instead of the other five is a person taking a nap in a hammock instead of someone standing on a trolley track.

A team of scientists led by Joshua Greene put people in an fMRI machine to watch what their brains did while they thought about the trolley problem and its other versions. When people thought about pulling the trolley switch to kill one person instead of five, the parts of the brain that do cool, rational thinking (the prefrontal cortex) lit up. When people thought about pushing a fat man onto the track, the parts of their brain that do emotion (the amygdala) lit up. The people decided not to push the fat man onto the track. Greene and the other scientists said they think human beings are more likely to make moral decisions using intuition when they are feeling emotions, for example the disgust they feel at the thought of killing an innocent fat man. Green and the other scientists said they think human beings are more likely to make decisions using logic when their emotions are not involved.

The trolley problem was in the episode "The Trolley Problem" on the second season of the sitcom "The Good Place".

Gao Wenbin

Gao Wenbin () (December 1921/1922 – 7 September 2020) was a Chinese historian, translator, university professor and jurist. He was the last surviving member of the Chinese delegation which represented the Republic of China at the Tokyo Trial. He was born in Yueyang, Hunan. 

In 1952, he was arrested by one of the teachers of the Soochow University Law School terming him as a "special suspect" and was sentenced to a minimum of ten years of labour reform. 

He joined the China Democratic League in 1985.

He had lectures at the University of Maine School of Law and at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. He also taught maritime law and international law at the Shanghai Maritime University.

Gao died on 7 September 2020 at a hospital in Shanghai from a long-illness, aged 99.

Shibboleth

A shibboleth () was originally a single word which distinguished one group from another.

Rather more widely, it is any custom or tradition that distinguishes one group of people from another. Shibboleths have been used throughout history in many societies as passwords. They are simple ways of self-identification: they signal loyalty and affinity.

The term comes from the Hebrew word "shibbólet" (), which means the part of a plant containing grain, such as the head of a stalk of wheat or rye. 

The modern use comes from an account in the Hebrew Bible. How this word was pronounced was used to distinguish friend from foe. In the Book of Judges, chapter 12, the inhabitants of Gilead inflicted a military defeat on the invading tribe of Ephraim (around 1370–1070 BC). The surviving Ephraimites tried to cross the River Jordan to their home territory, but the Gileadites secured the river's fords to stop them. 

To identify and kill the Ephraimites, the Gileadites told each suspected survivor to say the word "shibboleth" (with voiceless postalveolar fricative). The Ephraimite dialect resulted in a pronunciation that, to Gileadites, sounded like "sibboleth". In the King James Bible: 
The concept of a shibboleth is still with us. It is any word, phrase, jargon or pronunciation which identifies a person as a member of a particular group.

Landscape architecture

Landscape architecture is a field of design that deals with the design of garden buildings and open spaces: open public or private spaces, squares, gardens and parks, promenades and more. He who deals with landscape architecture is landscape architect. In most cases, landscape architecture is simultaneously associated with the architecture of buildings and planning and urban design, which are areas in which architects are engaged. Landscape architecture deals with different and varied forms of open spaces and different ways of planning the relationship between buildings and land and landscape and between man and nature or his urban environment.


Landscape urbanism

Landscape urbanism is a new theory in the field of urban and regional planning that first appeared in the late 20th century claiming that the best way to organize cities is through the landscape design of the city rather than the design of its buildings. The phrase urban landscape first appeared in the mid-1990s. Since then this phrase has received many different uses but is most often cited as a post-modernist response to the failures of "New Urbanism".

In 2008 the first Biennale in the world of "Landscape Urbanism" was held in the city of Bat-Yam in Israel which dealt with New Urbanism.
