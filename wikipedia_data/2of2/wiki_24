AutoIt

AutoIt is a freeware programming language for Microsoft Windows. In versions 1 and 2, it was used to create automation scripts for Microsoft Windows programs. These are sometimes called macros. In version 3, the programming language was extended to allow it to do more things.

The scripting language in AutoIt 1 and 2 was statement-driven. It was designed to simulate a user's input to the computer. From version 3 onward, the AutoIt syntax changed. It is now similar to the BASIC programming language. AutoIt version 3 is a general-purpose programming language. It can have types of data, such as arrays.

An AutoIt script can be converted into a stand-alone executable. This can be run on computers that do not have the AutoIt interpreter installed. A wide range of function libraries are available. They are known as UDFs, or "User Defined Functions". Some are included as standard. Others are available from the website. They add extra abilities to the language. AutoIt has a special editor, an Integrated development environment or IDE. It is based on the free SciTE editor. The compiler and help text are included in this special editor and provide a standard environment for developers.


AutoIt is often used to produce utility software for Microsoft Windows. These programs can automate routine tasks. Example use includes: systems management, monitoring, maintenance, and software installation. It is also used to simulate user interaction. In this use an application is "driven" to do things by an AutoIt script which behaves like a human user. An AutoIT script can issue keypresses, mouse clicks, type text and so on. In this way it simulates a human user of an application.

AutoIt has been used in low-cost laboratory automation. Applications include instrument synchronisation, alarm monitoring and results gathering. Devices such as 3D-printers can also be controlled.

Caine and Walters both won BAFTA and Golden Globe awards for best actor and actress. The British Film Institute ranked "Educating Rita" the 84th greatest British film of the 20th century.

Rita (Julie Walters) is a 26-year-old Liverpudlian working-class hairdresser. She is dissatisfied with the routine of her work. She is reluctant to have a child. She fears it will tie her to the same monotonous routine for life. She yearns to escape to something, without exactly knowing what that is. She signs up for an Open University course in English Literature. Her assigned tutor is Frank Bryant (Michael Caine). Bryant is a jaded university lecturer. He describes his abilities as "appalling but good enough for his appalling students". His passion for literature is reignited by Rita. Her ability for the subject is limited by her lack of education. Frank finds her enthusiasm refreshing. Frank's cynicism returns as he notices Rita beginning to adopt the pretensions of the university culture he despises. The film ends with Frank being sent to Australia.

Lewis Gilbert says it was difficult to raise finance for the film. "Columbia wanted me to cast Dolly Parton as Rita". Julie Walters, in her feature-film debut, reprised her role from the stage production.

Ian Nathan reviewing the film for Britain's "Empire" film magazine calls it a "gem,". He gave it four out of five stars.

American critic Janet Maslin called the film "the perfect play about literature for anyone who wouldn't dream of actually reading books".

Chicago critic Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four. He said Russell's screen adaptation "added mistresses, colleagues, husbands, in-laws, students and a faculty committee, [that were] all unnecessary".





In 1999, the film was among the BFI Top 100 British films.

In 2007, while promoting the remake of "Sleuth", Caine called "Educating Rita" "the last good picture [he] made before [he] mentally retired."

The Firm (1989 movie)

The Firm is a 1989 British made-for-television drama movie.

It was directed by Alan Clarke. It was written by Al Hunter Ashton for the BBC.

It stars Gary Oldman, Phil Davis, Charles Lawson and Steve McFadden.

The film is based on the activities of the Inter City Firm, a football firm of West Ham United during the 1970s and 1980s.

The film, courted controversy on release. It has come to be regarded among the best films on the subject of football hooliganism.

It is notable for having almost no background music. The only music is over the opening titles. It is Dean Martin's rendition of "That's Amore".

Oldman's performance has been hailed as one of the greatest of his career.

Clive Bissel (nicknamed "Bex", or "Bexy") is a married man with a baby son. He is the leader of a hooligan firm known as the ICC (Inter City Crew). His wife disapproves of his activities as a football hooligan. These contrast to his respectable job as an estate agent. He is unwilling to give up violence as it gives him a "buzz".

Bexy's father accepts his son's lifestyle. He takes a group photograph of the 'tooled up' gang. He boasts that he did similar activities when younger. He feels that Bex has gone soft because they now use weapons.

The film begins with a rival gang called "The Buccaneers" vandalising Bexy's Ford Sierra XR4x4. While Bexy is playing football, they spray graffiti in the dressing room. Yeti, the leader of the Bucaneeers drives a white Volkswagen Golf GTi cabriolet across the football pitch.

Bexy wants to form a 'National Firm' made up from rival gangs. He wants this 'firm' to be big enough to take on the large international hooligan groups. Bexy meets leaders from other firms in the Tower Hotel in London. This includes the Buccaneers. The other gangs like the idea. They do not like the idea of Bexy being "top boy". The rival firms agree to fight each other to decide who will lead the new "firm" into Europe.

Bexy uses intimidation to keep his position as leader of the ICC. The young men think of themselves as respected figures in their local community. Bexy's wife tells him that is not correct. She says everyone thinks of him as a joke. She says they fear his violent nature, so few are willing to stand up to him.

The ICC survive violent clashes with the other gangs. They must still defeat the Buccaneers. Bexy is looking forward to defeating Yeti. Bexy beats up Yeti during the ICC's clash with the Buccaneers. He is shot dead by an injured Yeti.

The closing scene depicts the surviving ICC members in a pub. They honour Bexy as a hero. They will fight the European firms in memory of their dead leader. The hooligans agree that Bex was a visionary who brought them together. They give him legendary status. They vow to continue.


"The Firm" proved controversial.

It has been both celebrated and condemned for its violent content.

Tom Dawson in "The List" reported that it "is widely considered to be the toughest and most insightful screen depiction of football hooligans".

"Vice" critic Harry Sword wrote that ""The Firm" remains the definitive celluloid document on football hooliganism".

Philip French in "The Observer" described the film as "by some way the best movie on the subject of football hooliganism and a key text on the subject of Thatcher's Britain."

Film4 hailed "The Firm" as a "brilliant and compelling drama". It features Oldman "at his visceral, intense best".

Josh Winning of "Total Film" observed its "unflinching depictions of violence". He named Oldman's "stunning" performance as the best of his career.

In 2018, Matthew Thrift of the British Film Institute wrote that Bissell "remains probably Gary Oldman's greatest screen performance".

"The Firm" has been described as a cult classic.

The film was first released on VHS on 21 Oct 1996. It was in a double pack with the similarly themed ID.

A DVD was first released by Prism Leisure on 2 Feb 2004.

The film has been sold as part of numerous box-sets. These often include films of a similar nature or from director Alan Clarke.

On 10 Sep 2007, the BBC released a special edition DVD in collectible SteelBook packaging. Extra features on the special edition include:

A version of the film was included in the 2016 DVD set "Alan Clarke at the BBC, Volume 2: Disruption". This version includes censored scenes restored from tape. The new scenes include: a more graphic version of Bex's blinding of Oboe, a scene of Bex mock-raping his wife, and Bex performing a knife attack on Yeti's private parts).
It was also released as a stand-alone DVD. Both releases were under the British Film Institute's control.

The story was adapted by Nick Love into the 2009 film of the same name.

Randnet

Randnet was the online system for the Nintendo 64DD. It was required for it to function. It no longer exists. The service was only released in Japan. 

Millook

Millook is a place on the north coast of Cornwall. It has these remarkable cliffs. The cliffs at Millook are so famous they were voted by the Geological Society as one of Britain's top 10 geological sites. They came top of the "folding and faulting" category. 

The cliffs have a series of horizontal chevron folds. The rocks were once sedimentary rocks laid down in deep water during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. We know this because they still contain brachiopod fossils of a type which lived in the late Devonian period. Later they were altered by heat from granite during mountain building in the English counties of Devon and Cornwall.

The Variscan orogeny caused the intrusion of the hot granite. The subsequent contact with the sandstones created the metamorphic rocks seen today. This also put intense pressure on the sediments causing them to be folded and faulted. What we see is a small part of a huge mountain system caused by a continental collision between Euramerica (Laurussia) and Gondwana. This formed the supercontinent of Pangaea.

Duty to rescue

Duty to rescue is a concept that many law systems have: In certain cirumstances, someone can be held responsible for not helping another person who is in danger, and who would be injured, or who would die, if not helped. People are required to help to the best of their abilities. As a bare minimum, this often means alerting emergency services. 

Not all law systems have this concept, and in general the following is true:


Those helping are often protected by law, against errors they make.

In many cases, the duty to rescue has become customary law. This is the case for example for helping people at sea.
A moral or ethical duty to rescue may exist even where there is no legal duty to rescue. Such a duty can be justified in different ways.

One kind of justification is general and applies regardless of role-related relationships: Under this general justification, people have a duty to rescue other people in distress because of their common humanity. With this justification, the specific skills of the rescuer or the nature of the victim's distress are irrelevant. 

This kind would justify cases of rescue and in fact make such rescue a duty even between strangers. With this justification in mind, philosopher Peter Singer suggests that if one saw a child drowning and could intervene to save him, they should do so, if the cost is moderate to themselves. Damage to their clothing or shoes or how late it might make them for a meeting would be an insufficient excuse to avoid assistance. Singer goes on to say that one should also try to rescue distant strangers, not just nearby children, because globalization has made it possible to do so. Such general arguments for a duty to rescue also explain why after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Haitians were digging family members, friends, and strangers out of the rubble with their bare hands and carrying injured persons to whatever medical care was available. It also explains why, journalist and physician Sanjay Gupta and a number of other MD-journalists began acting as physicians to treat injuries rather than remaining uninvolved in their journalistic roles. Similarly, they justify journalist Anderson Cooper's attempt to shepherd an injured young boy away from some "toughs" nearby in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake.

Specific arguments for such a duty to rescue include:


There are also ethical justifications for role-specific or skill-specific duties of rescue such as those described above under the discussion of U.S. Common Law. Generally, these justifications are rooted in the idea that the "best" rescues, the most effective rescues, are done by those with special skills. Such persons, when available to rescue, are thus even more required to do so ethically than regular persons who might simply make things worse (for a utilitarian, rescue by a skilled professional in a relevant field would maximize the good even better than rescue by a regular stranger). This particular ethical argument makes sense when considering the ability firefighters to get both themselves and victims safely out of a burning building, or of health care personnel such as physicians, nurses, physician's assistants, and EMTs to provide medical rescue.

Another movie called "Fierce Creatures" came out in 1997. The same actors star in it but play different characters. It does not continue the story of A Fish Called Wanda.

George Thomason and Ken Pile are gangsters in London. Ken loves animals and he has a stutter. They plan to steal a jewels. They ask two Americans for help: con artist Wanda Gershwitz and weapons expert Otto West. Otto is a stupid and mean. Also, he does not like British people. Wanda and Otto are lovers. They hide this from George and Ken by pretending to be siblings. This frees Wanda to work her charms on them.

The robbery is successful and the gang escapes with a lot of diamonds. They hide them in a safe in an old workshop. Wanda and Otto betray George to the police and he is arrested. They return to collect the diamonds. Wanda plans to double-cross Otto as well. She finds that George has moved the diamonds. Wanda discovers the key to the safe deposit box containing the diamonds in Ken's fish tank. She hides it in her pendant.

Wanda seduces George's barrister, Archie Leach. Archie is in a loveless marriage. He quickly falls for Wanda. She gets him to persuade George to plead guilty and to tell the location of the diamonds. Otto is jealous. His interference causes Wanda and Archie's liaisons to go disastrously wrong. Wanda accidentally leaves her pendant at Archie's house. Archie's wife, Wendy, mistakes it as a gift for her. At Wanda's insistence, Archie recovers the pendant by staging a burglary. Archie feels guilty and ends the affair.

George asks Ken to kill Mrs Coady. She is the Crown's only eyewitness to the robbery. Ken tries three times. Each time he accidentally kills one of her dogs instead. This causes him great distress. The last dog's death gives her a fatal heart attack. So Otto is successful. With no witness, George seems poised to get off soon. He reveals the location of the diamonds to Ken. Otto learns Ken now knows where they are. Otto tries to force Ken to reveal where the diamonds are by eating his pet fish. He leaves Ken's favourite, named Wanda, until last. Ken reveals that the diamonds are at a hotel near Heathrow Airport.

With Otto's knowledge and Wanda's key, the pair want George to remain in jail. At his trial, defence witness Wanda unexpectedly gives evidence against him. Archie is stunned. He is flustered and messess up his questioning. He inadvertently calls Wanda "darling". Wendy realises that Archie has had an affair. She declares their marriage over.

With no career and no marriage, Archie resolves to cut his losses, steal the diamonds for himself and flee to South America. George tells Archie that Ken knows where the diamonds are. Archie sees Wanda fleeing the courthouse. He pulls her into his car and races to Ken's flat. As Archie runs into the building, Otto steals Archie's car, taking Wanda with him. Ken and Archie give chase. Otto and Wanda recover the diamonds. Wanda double-crosses Otto and leaves him unconscious in a broom cupboard. After recovering, Otto shoots his way out and is confronted by Archie. Otto is about to kill Archie. Archie stalls him by taunting Otto about American failures such as the Vietnam War. Ken arrives, driving a steamroller, seeking vengeance for his fish. Otto, who has stepped in wet concrete and cannot move, is run over but survives. Archie and Wanda board the plane. Otto clings to the outside of the plane. He curses them until he is blown off as the plane takes off.

In 1969, Cleese and Crichton tried to make a film together but it never got started.
They promised each other that they would work on a film in the future.

In June 1983, they began writing the script for "Wanda". For the next two and half years they met three times a month to work on the script.
According to Crichton, "We had a week of rehearsals and then a gap of two weeks in which to incorporate any new ideas which had been thrown up and to polish the script."
According to Michael Palin, the original title was "A Goldfish Called Wanda."

Cleese told an interviewer why he called his character Archie Leach. Cary Grant's real name was Archie Leach. Cleese said "I feel this film is as near as I'll ever get to being Cary Grant."

Cleese served as co-director as the studio executives at MGM were worried about Crichton's age. He was 78 years old at the time. On the set, Crichton wore a T-shirt presented to him by Cleese and inscribed "Age and treachery will always overcome youth and skill".

The film was shot in London during the summer of 1987.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 93% approval rating, based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10.
"Smartly written, smoothly directed, and solidly cast, "A Fish Called Wanda" offers a classic example of a brainy comedy with widespread appeal."

On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 80 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews."

Six weeks after release it reached number one at the box office in the United States. It eventually grossed $62,493,712 in the US. It was the number one rental video in the US in 1989.

During the initial run of the film, a Danish audiologist named Ole Bentzen died during a screening when his heart rate rose to an estimated 250–500 beats per minute from laughing at a scene too hard, leading to a fatal heart attack.

In 2016, "Empire" magazine ranked "A Fish Called Wanda" 35th on their list of the 100 best British films. They called it "a must-own for any British comedy fan". They said, "it made possible Richard Curtis's later Brit-com oeuvre by establishing that British eccentricism can sell, revived the world's interest in Ealing comedies, and allowed a character with Cary Grant's real name – Cleese's bumbling lawyer Archie Leach – to live again on the big screen".

The film is number 27 on Bravo's "100 Funniest Movies". It is also included in the "Reader's Digest" "100 Funniest Films" list.

In 1999, the British Film Institute ranked it 39th of the BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century

In 2000, the American Film Institute placed the film 21st on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list.

In 2003, AFI nominated Otto West as a villain from this film for AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains.

James Berardinelli of "ReelViews" awarded the film four out of four stars in his review; it is also number 10 on his "Top 100" list.

The main actors worked together again in 1997 to make "Fierce Creatures". It is not a sequel or prequel, but is similar in style to A Fish Called Wanda. It is called a spiritual sequel. The actors played different characters. "Fierce Creatures" was not as well received by critics or audiences as "A Fish Called Wanda".

The novelization of "Fierce Creatures", written by Iain Johnstone, who co-wrote the film, begins with a letter from Archie (John Cleese's character in the first film) to his brother Rollo. According to the letter:

A loose Indian adaptation, "Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav", was released in 2005.

In 2008, it was reported that John Cleese and his daughter, Cynthia (who played his screen daughter, Portia), had started to work on a stage musical version of the film.

Constitutional law

Constitutional law is an area of law that shows how the institutions of a country are organised, and the basic rights rights of citizens. In most countries, such as the United States, this is found in a written text called a constitution. Some countries use a lot of different texts and unwritten rules instead, such as the United Kingdom.

Constitutional law explains how different institutions relate to each other. For example, the relationship between the legislature, executive, and judiciary. In a federal country, constitutional law explains what the powers of the central government and state governments are.

Constitutional law shows citizens what rights they have. Some examples are the United States Bill of Rights, or the European Convention on Human Rights.

Liverpool Playhouse

The Liverpool Playhouse is a theatre in Williamson Square in the city of Liverpool, England. 

It started in 1866 as a music hall. 

In 1911 it became a repertory theatre. It nurtured the early careers of many actors and actresses. Some of whom went on to achieve national and international reputations. 

Architectural changes have been made to the building over the years. The latest change was in 1968. A modern-style extension was added to the north of the theatre. 

In 1999 a trust was formed. This joined the management of the Playhouse with that of the Everyman Theatre.

In 1866, the present theatre opened. It was named the Star Music Hall. It was designed by Edward Davies. It replaced an earlier theatre called the Star Concert Hall. 

In 1895 its name was changed to the Star Theatre of Varieties. 

In 1898 it was improved by Harry Percival with a new auditorium and foyer. Electricity was installed. 

In 1911 the Liverpool Repertory Theatre Limited was established. Basil Dean was its "controller and producer". The company could not afford to build a new theatre. It bought the Star Theatre for £28,000 (). 
This made it the first repertory in Britain to own the freehold of a theatre. The company spent a further £4,000 () on redesigning and modernising the theatre. 
The auditorium and the basement foyer were redesigned by Stanley Adshead. He was the Professor of Civic Design at the Liverpool School of Architecture. 
The theatre was for many years managed by Maud Carpenter.
The theatre was renamed the Liverpool Repertory Theatre.

In 1916, it was renamed the Liverpool Playhouse. 

In 1961 and 1966, minor structural alterations were made to the theatre. 

In 1968 a modern-style extension was added to the north of the theatre. This was to accommodate new foyers, bars, dressing rooms and a workshop. 

In the 1990s the theatre company went into liquidation.

In 1999 the Liverpool and Merseyside Theatres Trust Limited was established as a charity, and the theatre re-opened. It is managed jointly with the Everyman Theatre by Liverpool City Council.

As a repertory company, the theatre has been involved in the careers of actors and actresses who have later achieved wide fame. Noël Coward and Gertrude Lawrence worked with the company as child actors. Other artistes who gained experience at the theatre include Robert Donat, Lilian Braithwaite, Cecil Parker, John Gregson, Clive Brook, C. Aubrey Smith, Richard Burton, Michael Redgrave, Diana Wynyard, Rex Harrison, Patricia Routledge, Anthony Hopkins, and Richard Briers.

The exterior of the older part of the theatre is stuccoed. It has a slate roof. 

Its entrance faces Williamson Square. It has seven bays and is in three storeys. The central three bays project forward. They are surmounted by a broken pediment. On the ground floor the central bays contain three entrances. These are separated by pillars. These lead to a recessed porch. Over each entrance is an architrave containing a fanlight. The lateral bays contain two round-headed and one flat-headed entrance on each side. There are three blind round windows. In the middle storey the bays are separated by pilasters. The three central bays each have a balustrade and a window with a tympanum containing a roundel. Each of the three lateral bays contains a window with a cornice, and a round window above it. Along the top storey are oculi between panelled pilasters. On the summit of each of the two lateral bays is a cupola on a short Tuscan colonnade. 

Inside the older part of the theatre are two balconies. These are supported by cast iron columns. The interior is decorated in Greek Revival style.

The newer section is constructed in concrete. It is mostly faced by glass. 

On the ground floor are entrance doors. Above this, the building is based around three cylinders. The largest of these starts at the first floor and rises through two storeys. It is cantilevered from a central column. To the left is a smaller cylinder, cantilevered from a separate column, interlocking with the larger cylinder. 

Inside the whole is a hollow column containing the stairs.

The theatre is recorded in the National Heritage List for England. On 14 March 1975, it was designated a Grade II* listed building. 
The list quotes the "Architects' Journal" of 1968. This says the older section is "significant as an early and rare work by one of the pioneers of the Liverpool School of Architecture, in the Grecian style favoured by the school at that date". Of the newer section it says that it is "a brilliant concept, joyously realised, which exploits asymmetrical volumes and ever varying spaces yet achieves unity and also balance with the adjoining Victorian façade". 

In the "Buildings of England" series, the architectural historians Richard Pollard and Nikolaus Pevsner say of the newer section that it is "a spectacular composition which creates an atmosphere of excitement and anticipation, exactly right for a theatre foyer".


Robert Fulton

Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle

Thomas Pelham-Holles (21 July 1693 – 17 November 1768) was 1st Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne and 1st Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyme. He was a British Whig statesman, and the third Prime Minister. He was Prime Minister for two separate terms. He is commonly known as the Duke of Newcastle.

His official life extended throughout the Whig supremacy of the 18th century.
He was a protégé of Sir Robert Walpole, and served under him for more than 20 years until 1742. He held power with his brother, Prime Minister Henry Pelham, until 1754. By then he had served as a Secretary of State continuously for 30 years and dominated British foreign policy.

After Henry's death, the Duke of Newcastle was prime minister for six years in two separate periods. His first premiership (17541756) was not particularly notable: Newcastle partly caused the Seven Years' War, and his weak diplomacy cost him the premiership. After his second term (17571762), he served briefly in Lord Rockingham's ministry, before he retired from government. He was most effective as a deputy to a leader of greater ability, such as Walpole, his brother, or William Pitt the Elder.

Samsung Galaxy S10

Samsung Galaxy S10 is a line of Android-based smartphones manufactured, released and marketed by Samsung Electronics as part of the Samsung Galaxy S series. The Galaxy S10 series is a celebratory series of the 10th anniversary of the Samsung Galaxy S flagship line, its top line of phones next to the Note models. Unveiled during the "Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2019" press event held on February 20, 2019, the devices started shipping in certain regions such as Australia and the United States on March 6, 2019, then worldwide on March 8, 2019. It is the tenth generation of Samsung's Galaxy S series of smartphones.

As has been done since the Galaxy S6, Samsung unveiled flagship Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ models, differentiated primarily by screen size and an additional front-facing camera on the S10+. In addition, Samsung also unveiled a smaller model known as the Galaxy S10e, as well as a larger, 5G-compatible version, the Galaxy S10 5G. In 2020, a midrange variant, the Galaxy S10 Lite, was also introduced.

The Galaxy S10e, S10 and S10+ launch prices started at $749/£586, $899/£704 and $999/£782, while the S10 5G's launch price was $1299.
On March 6, 2020, Samsung launched the successor to the S10, the Samsung Galaxy S20.

The S10 line comprises five models with various hardware specifications; the main S10 and S10+ respectively feature 6.1 and 6.4-inch 1440p "Dynamic AMOLED" displays with HDR10+ support and "dynamic tone mapping" technology. The displays have curved sides that slope over the horizontal edges of the device. Unlike previous Samsung phones, their front-facing cameras occupy a rounded cut-out near the top-right of the display, and both models use an ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint reader. While providing better performance over the optical in-screen fingerprint readers introduced by other recent phones, they are not compatible with all screen protectors. Due to this, the S10 and S10+ are both supplied with a pre-installed plastic screen protector.

International models of the S10 use the Exynos 9820 system-on-chip, while the U.S. and Chinese models use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855. The two devices are sold with 128 or 512 GB of internal storage along with 8GB of RAM, with the S10+ also being sold in a 1-terabyte model with 12GB of RAM. They respectively contain 3400 mAh with the standard S10 and 4100 mAh batteries for the S10+ model, supporting Qi inductive charging, and the ability to charge other Qi-compatible devices from their own battery power.

The S10 features a 3-lens rear-facing camera setup; it retains the dual-aperture 12-megapixel and 12-megapixel telephoto lenses of the Galaxy S9+, but now uses a camera module introduced on the Note 9 and also adds a 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle lens. The front-facing camera on the S10+ is accompanied by a second RGB depth sensor, which Samsung states helps improve the quality of photo effects and augmented reality image filters. Both sets of cameras support 4K video recording and HDR10+. The camera software includes a new "Shot Suggestion" feature to assist users, "Artistic Live Filters", as well as the ability to post directly to Instagram posts and stories. S10+ uses a double hole punch design for the front camera, while S10 uses a single hole punch design. The Galaxy S10e and S10 make use of "advanced heat-pipe" cooling systems, but the more expensive Galaxy S10 Plus uses a vapor chamber cooling system.

In the manual mode, the exposure time can be increased up to ten seconds.

Alongside the main S10 and S10+, Samsung also unveiled two additional models. The S10e is a downsized version of the S10, featuring a smaller, flat, 5.8-inch 1080p display with no curved edges. Its fingerprint reader is contained within the power button on the right side rather than in-display, and it excludes the 12-megapixel telephoto camera of the S10. It still includes the dual-aperture 12-megapixel and 16-megapixel ultra-wide-angle sensors. There is also a larger, phablet-sized premium model known as the S10 5G, which features support for 5G wireless networks, a 6.7-inch display, 256 or 512 GB of non-expandable storage, additional 3D time-of-flight cameras on both the front and rear, and a non-user-replaceable 4,500 mAh battery. This model was temporarily exclusive to Verizon Wireless on launch in 2019 before expanding to other carriers in the weeks after launch.

Charging speeds are 45 Watts on the S10 Lite, 25 Watts on the S10 5G and 15 Watts on the S10e.

The S10 series (except S10 Lite) is the last model in the Galaxy S series to feature 3.5 mm headphone jack as its successors, the S20, S20+ and S20 Ultra, do not. 

In January 2020, the S10 Lite was released. It is a midrange variant of the S10, containing the same cameras as the main variant. It features 128 GB of expandable storage, a 6.5 inch 1080p screen on a plastic frame, and a 4,500 mAh battery. This variant removes the 3.5 mm headphone jack featured on all of the 2019 variants of the S10, as well as wireless charging, instead being equipped with 25 watt Super Fast Charging picked up from the Galaxy Note 10. Unlike the main variants, the S10 Lite is only offered with Snapdragon 855 chipset.

Galaxy S10e, S10, and S10+ are available in the colors Prism White, Prism Black, Prism Green, Prism Blue, Cardinal Red, Flamingo Pink and Smoke Blue. Galaxy S10e is also available in Canary Yellow. Galaxy S10 5G comes in the colors Crown Silver, Majestic Black, and Royal Gold. Galaxy S10+ and Galaxy S10+ Performance Edition offer two additional color choices: Ceramic Black and White. The Performance Edition ceramic models offer 12GB RAM and 1TB of internal storage.

The S10 range ships with Android 9.0 "Pie". They are the first Samsung smartphones to ship with a major revamp of Samsung's Android user experience known as One UI. A main design element of One UI is intentional repositioning of key user interface elements in stock apps to improve usability on large screens. Many apps include large headers that push the beginning of content towards the center of the display, while navigation controls and other prompts are often displayed near the bottom of the display instead.

Samsung released the Android 10 update to the Galaxy S10 series on 28 November 2019. The update includes One UI version 2.0.

On 18 August 2020, it was announced by Samsung that all variants of the S10 series would be supported for three generations of Android software updates. 

An official list released by Samsung on December 2, 2020, further confirmed that all S10 models would be receiving the Android 11 upgrade with One UI 3.

The fingerprint scanner had a security flaw that allowed anyone to unlock the phone with a silicone screen protector, which also affected the Note 10. Samsung rolled out a patch to fix this problem on October 23, 2019.

Dan Seifert from "The Verge" gave the S10 a score of 8.5/10, praising its excellent display, performance, battery life, versatile camera system and headphone jack inclusion. However, he noted that the new in-screen fingerprint scanner was slower and more finicky and camera performance was not as good as the Pixel 3's in low light.

Andrei Frumusanu from "AnandTech" reported that the Exynos 9820 performed significantly better than last year's Exynos 9810, although he also stated that the Exynos 9820 still couldn't keep up with the Snapdragon 855. He has not tested the power efficiency of the Exynos 9820 yet.

Marques Brownlee praised the S10's One UI for improving one-handed usability. He labelled the S10+ as one of the few $1000 smartphones that are worth their price tag.

Jeffrey Van Camp from "Wired" rated the S10 9/10 for its all-screen design, fun features, ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, wireless charging with power sharing and headphone jack inclusion. His complaints were that the camera, while fantastic, still couldn't rival the Pixel 3's night shots, it could be difficult to find what the user wanted in the settings menus, wireless power sharing was slow and the edges needed palm rejection.

The S10+ received an overall score of 109 from "DXOMARK"; it had a photo score of 114, a video score of 97, and a selfie score of 96. The S10 5G received an overall score of 112, tying it as the site's top ranked phone at the time along with the P30 Pro. It had a photo score of 117, a video score of 100, and a selfie score of 97.

Sales of the S10 have exceeded that of the preceding S9, with the S10+ being the most popular model followed by the regular S10 and then the S10e.



Jeanine Áñez

Jeanine Áñez Chávez (born 13 August 1967) is a Bolivian lawyer. She was the 81st President of Bolivia from 11 November 2019 to 8 November 2020. She became president following the resignation of President Evo Morales. She was a Senator, representing Beni. She is the second female President of Bolivia.

During this political crisis, and after the resignation of President Evo Morales and other officials in the line of succession, Áñez declared herself next in line to assume the presidency. Áñez declared herself president of the Senate, then used that position to become president, a move that was legally supported. 

Áñez issued a decree removing criminal liability for military and police in dealing with protesters. She oversaw the Senkata and Sacaba massacres. Her government launched numerous criminal investigations into former MAS officials, for which she was accused of political persecution. She ended Bolivia's close links with the governments of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, while bettering relations with the United States. 

After delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and protests, new elections were held in October 2020. Áñez launched her own presidential campaign, with criticism saying that she was not neutral. She withdrew her candidacy a month before the election after low poll numbers.

In the early hours of 13 March 2021, Áñez was arrested on charges of terrorism, sedition and conspiracy over her actions during the 2019 coup of Evo Morales. In June 2022, she was sentenced to ten years in prison for her role in the 2019 political crisis.

Wing coupling

Wing coupling is common in some four-winged insects such as moths. It makes them "functionally dipterous". They are effectively two-winged. The advantage is more efficient flight. 

In many moths the wing coupling is done by a tiny hook going round a tiny spur. In butterflies and some moths the wing coupling is got by wing overlap, rather than hooks.

Sphingid moths have been much studied for their flying ability, especially their ability to move rapidly from side to side while hovering, called "swing-hovering" or "side-slipping". This is thought to have evolved to deal with ambush predators that lie in wait in flowers.

Bitburg

Bitburg (; ; ) is a city in Germany, in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate approximately northwest of Trier and northeast of Luxembourg city.

Bitburg controversy

The Bitburg controversy involved a ceremonial visit by U.S. President Ronald Reagan to a German military cemetery in Bitburg, a town in extreme western Germany near the border with Luxembourg, in May 1985, designed to celebrate the end of World War II in Europe 40 years earlier. 

The visit caused some controversy, both in the United States and around the world, when it became known that members of the Waffen-SS, the military arm of Nazi Germany's SS ("Schutzstaffel"), were also buried there. The entire SS was judged to be a criminal organisation at the Nuremberg trials. The fact that Reagan had not been scheduled to visit former Nazi concentration-camp sites compounded the controversy, and a trip to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was later added to his itinerary.

On Sunday 5 May, Reagan and Kohl appeared at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The U.S. President's speech there, according to "Time", was a "skillful exercise in both the art of eulogy and political damage control." Reagan said:

All these children of God, under bleak and lifeless mounds, the plainness of which does not even hint at the unspeakable acts that created them. Here they lie, never to hope, never to pray, never to live, never to heal, never to laugh, never to cry... And then, rising above all this cruelty, out of this tragic and nightmarish time, beyond the anguish, the pain and suffering, and for all time, we can and must pledge: never again.

Reagan responded about the controversy: "This visit has stirred many emotions in the American and German people too. Some old wounds have been reopened, and this I regret very much, because this should be a time of healing."

Salp

A salp is a barrel-shaped, planktic tunicate. 

Salps moves by contracting. This pumps water through their gelatinous bodies. It is one of the most efficient examples of jet propulsion in the animal kingdom. 

The salp pumps water through its internal feeding filters and feeds on phytoplankton.

Salps are common in all seas. The most salps are in the Southern Ocean (near Antarctica), where they may form enormous swarms, often in deep water. They are sometimes even more abundant than krill.

Although salps look similar to jellyfish with their simple body form and behaviour, in fact they are chordates. This means they are animals with a dorsal nerve cord. They are related to vertebrates, animals with backbones.

Sonic the Hedgehog (movie)

Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2020 adventure movie. It is based on the video game series of the same name by Sega. It is directed by Jeff Fowler from a screenplay by Patrick Casey, Josh Miller, and Oren Uziel.

It was originally going to be released on November 8, 2019, but had been delayed because the old design for Sonic was criticized by fans. The movie was released on February 14, 2020. A sequel to the movie titled "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" released on April 8, 2022.

The film begins with Sonic running away from Dr. Robotnik. The movie then rewinds to the beginning.

Sonic is shown running in Green Hill Zone, bringing back a flower to Longclaw, Sonic's guardian. Longclaw warns Sonic that somebody could have seen him, but Sonic doesn't believe her. It turns out she is right and multiple echidnas had seen him, and they attack them for his speed. Longclaw gives Sonic her rings, and tells him that they can travel between dimensions, and that Sonic should use them if he is ever spotted. Sonic uses the ring and goes to another dimension. He tries to get back to his home realm, but the gateway closes before he could do so.

Ten years later, Sonic eventually finds his way into Earth. There, Tom Wackowski, on parking duty, is bored and is waiting for a car to speed. He finds a turtle, and his speed gun reads "0.01". Then, Sonic passes by, with his speed gun reading 296. He passes by again, this time his gun reads 300. The turtle is in the street, about to get run over when Sonic saves him, and brings him to a forest, and returns home.

Sonic tells the viewers his life, then accidentally drops his rings. He picks them up, and then tells us that if he gets spotted, he will have to migrate to a mushroom planet.

After watching a baseball game, that night, he plays baseball by himself, but realizes that he is alone and runs fast, accidentally causing an explosion that shuts down the electric power across the entire Pacific Coast. The government suggests Dr. Robotnik to figure this out.

Dr. Robotnik joins the investigation, insulting the workers. He uses his technology and one of his drones finds a blue hair left from Sonic. Robotnik identifies this as a "new species".

Seeing he is being hunted, Sonic plots to leave Earth for a different planet; he is reluctant to do so as the planet only consists of fungi. However, Tom discovers Sonic in his shed and tranquilizes him, causing Sonic to accidentally create a portal to the Transamerica Pyramid's tower roof upon reading the writing on Tom's shirt. Sonic accidentally drops his bag of rings on the tower's roof through the warp ring before he passes out. Tom hesitantly agrees to help Sonic and the two flee when confronted by Robotnik, who falsely labels Tom a domestic terrorist. The two slowly bond, with Tom relating to Sonic's desire for friends. Sonic creates a bucket list and Tom helps him complete several entries along their journey.

Meanwhile, Robotnik, discovering that one of Sonic's quills holds an almost limitless amount of electrical energy, plans to capture Sonic to use his powers for his machines. As he tracks them down, Sonic and Tom manage to fight off several mechanized drones called Badniks sent by Robotnik, but Sonic is injured in the battle.

Arriving in San Francisco, Tom brings Sonic to Maddie, who treats him at her sister Rachel's home. Sonic receives a new pair of red sneakers to replace his ruined ones from Rachel's daughter Jojo. The group heads to the roof of the tower and recovers the rings as Robotnik arrives in an advanced attack hovercraft powered by the quill, now decked in a red and pink flight suit and red flight goggles. Sonic fights off Robotnik's Badniks, hastily using one of his Warp Rings to send Tom and Maddie back to a Green Hills farm to protect them after pushing them off the tower; however, Robotnik uses the quill's power to match Sonic's speed. Sonic fights Robotnik in a chase across the world utilizing the Warp Rings before Robotnik subdues Sonic in Green Hills. Tom and the townsfolk intervene, and Tom acknowledges Sonic as his friend, causing Sonic to regain his power. Sonic takes back his quill's power from Robotnik, weakening Robotnik's hovercraft. Sonic also promises himself that he will always use his power to protect his friends. Using his powerful spin attack, Sonic obliterates Robotnik's hovercraft and defeats him by banishing him into a warp ring portal to the mushroom planet.

Following the incident, Tom and Maddie decide to stay in Green Hills and let Sonic live with them, treating him as a surrogate son. The government erases all evidence of the events, including records of Robotnik's existence, rewarding Tom and Maddie with an Olive Garden gift card as a small token of gratitude. Three months later, Robotnik, now bald and with a larger moustache, is still in possession of Sonic's quill and usable equipment salvaged from the remains of his hovercraft, planning his return and revenge against Sonic.



The first trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog movie was released to YouTube on April 2019. However, on the video, it received many more dislikes than likes on the trailer. Many fans were concerned that the Sonic design in the trailer looked too human-like, which made it too creepy to them.

Interstellar cloud

An interstellar cloud is a denser-than-average part of the interstellar medium, (ISM). It is matter and radiation in the space between the star systems in a galaxy. 

An interstellar cloud is formed by the gas and dust particles from a red giant in its later life.

The cloud is made of gas, plasma, and dust in our and other galaxies. 

Its hydrogen can be:

Neutral and ionized clouds are sometimes also called "diffuse clouds". 

H I region

An HI region or H I region ("H one") is a cloud in the interstellar medium composed of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI).

These regions do not emit detectable visible light (except in spectral lines from metal elements). 

H I regions are clouds of neutral hydrogen which glow faintly with infrared light. Because they are common in our galaxy, they obscure distant views at extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray wavelengths. An exception is the Lockman Hole, through which we have a fairly clear window to distant objects. 

Another window into deep space is the Chandra Deep Field South. This was chosen for the Chandra X-ray Observatory satellite.

Lockman Hole

The Lockman Hole is an area of the sky which is like a clear window into far distant space.

From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, most directions are partly blocked or obscured by H I clouds of neutral hydrogen. These glow faintly with infrared light and obscure distant views at extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray wavelengths. 

The H I clouds interfere with observations at those wavelengths in nearly all other directions. So the Lockman Hole is an attractive area of the sky for observational astronomy surveys. It is near the pointer stars of the Big Dipper in the constellation Ursa Major. is about 15 square degrees in size, and is named after its discoverer, astronomer Jay Lockman.

Chandra Deep Field South

The Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) is an image taken by the Chandra X-ray Observatory satellite. 

The location has, like the Lockman Hole, a relatively clear "window" through the clouds of neutral hydrogen gas in our Milky Way galaxy. This allows us to clearly see the rest of the universe in X-rays. 

The image is centered on a patch of sky in the Southern Hemisphere Fornax constellation. This region was selected because it has much less galactic gas and dust to obscure distant sources.

More observations was taken between 2000 and 2010. The Chandra Deep Field South is the single target where Chandra has observed the longest.

Seminole

Daimokutate

The is a recitation show at Yahashira shrine in Kami-fukawa village, near the city of Nara .

The Shinto Temple in Kamifukawa has a tradition of accepting a 17-year-old boy as a member of a religious organization that carries out religious ceremonies at the temple. The acceptance of a boy into the organization at the temple is an acknowledgment that the child has become an adult.

Young men, aged 17 (If there are not enough boys aged 17 years, boys who are not yet 17 years old or are over 17 years old are also included in the performance) stand in a semi-circle dressed in samurai clothes and carrying bows. One by one, they are called to the centre by an old man who reads the name of a character in the tales of the feud between the Genji and Heike clans. There is no musical accompaniment. When all twenty-six characters have spoken, the youths rhythmically stamp their feet and sing offstage.

Originally a rite of passage at the age of seventeen to mark the formal acceptance of the eldest son into the community of the twenty-two families of Kami-fukawa, the Daimokutate is now performed annually in mid-October by young men of various ages and from many different families.Unique in Japan as a dramatic performance without acting or music, the Daimokutate is an important marker of identity and plays an indispensable role in maintaining solidarity in this mountainous town.

The Daimokutate was performed around the end of the Muromachi period (XVI century). Daimokutate is the last living example of a tradition of reciting in sanctuary by ordinary people, attested for the first time in a document of 1534.

Documents collected by the folklore specialist Hosen Jungo between 1953 and 1955, have been preserved, but it is likely that the repertoire was much larger.

Daimokutate was inscribed in 2009 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of Unesco .

Haghpat Monastery

Haghpat Monastery, also known as Haghpatavank (), is a medieval monastery complex in Haghpat, Armenia. 

The monastery was founded by Queen Khosrovanuysh, wife of the Bagratid king Ashot III, probably in 976. The nearby monastery at Sanahin was built around the same time. 

The largest church in the complex, the Cathedral of Surb Nishan, probably begun in 976, was completed in 991 by king Smbat. It is a typical example of tenth century Armenian architecture, its central dome rests on the four imposing pillars of the lateral walls. The Armenian Prince Khutulukhaga, is depicted in the south transept (a transversal nave intersecting the main nave). The sons of the church's founder, Princes Smbat and Kurike, are shown with Queen Khosravanuysh in a bas-relieff. Excepet from one or two minor restorations carried out in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the church is preserved its original character.

There are several other structures at the site as well. There is the small domed Church of Sourb Grigor (St. Gregory ) from 1005. Two side chapels were added to the original church; the larger one built in the beginning of the 13th century and the smaller, known as "Hamazasp House", built in 1257. In 1245. Other 13th century additions include the chapel of Sourb Astvatsatsin, the scriptorium, and a large refectory which is outside the monastery limits.

There are also a number of splendid khachkars (cross-stones) of the 11th-13th centuries standing on the territory of the monastery.

The monastery has been damaged many times. Sometime around 1130, an earthquake destroyed parts of Haghpat Monastery and it was not restored until fifty years later. It also suffered numerous attacks by armed forces in the many centuries of its existence and from a major earthquake in 1988. But much of the complex is still intact today without substantial alterations.

Today the area is an popular tourist site.

Described as a "masterpiece of religious architecture and a major center of learning in the Middle Ages", Haghpat monastery, together with Sanahin monastery, was placed on UNESCO's World Heritage List in 1996.

The monasteries at Haghpat and Sanahin were chosen as UNESCO World Heritage Sites because:
The two monastic complexes represent the highest flowering of Armenian religious architecture, with unique style developed from a mix of elements of Byzantine ecclesiastical architecture and the traditional vernacular architecture of the Caucasian region.

Protégé

A protégé is literally a "protected one". It is used of a younger person being being developed under the guidance of an experienced older person. It is a French term.

The younger person might be seen as an apprentice, and the older person as a mentor. If it is a physical activity, such as sport or dance, then the formal term might be 'trainer'. However, the term is "not" formal or official. It is just a way of describing a relationship. Psychosocial support and career guidance come into it, but usually not money. 

So the relationship is informal, but often important for the protégé.

Lowrey organ

The Lowrey organ is an electronic organ named for its developer, Frederick C. Lowrey (1871-1955). He was a Chicago-based industrialist and entrepreneur. It was in 1955, the year he died, that Lowrey's full-sized electronic organ was first commercially successful. It was called the Model S Spinet or "Berkshire".
Lowrey had earlier developed an attachment for a piano. This added electronic organ stops on 60 notes while keeping the piano functionality. It was called the "Organo". It was first sold in 1949 It was a successful competitor to the Hammond "Solovox".

During the 1960s and 1970s, Lowrey was the largest manufacturer of electronic organs in the world. In 1989, the Lowrey Organ Company produced its 1,000,000th organ.
Up until 2011, Lowrey organs were built in LaGrange Park, Illinois. In 2011, it was announced that some models would be made in Indonesia.

From 1918-1940's, Frederick Lowrey experimented with electronic organ design. He tried different methods of tone generation. In the 1940s he fixed on the Eccles-Jordan circuit. This is a stable flip-flop oscillator. It became a Lowrey hallmark. The Lowrey organ relied on all-electronic tone generation. This was different to its main competitor, the Hammond organ. Hammond used electromechanical until 1975. Lowrey led Hammond in the development of automatic accompaniment features. In 1968, automatic rhythm was added. In 1970, the "Genie" model added automatic left hand and pedal. Lowrey originally targeted the home entertainment market. Lowrey also produced theatre organs and a full 2-manual with pedal church organ. 

In the 1960s and 1970s, Lowreys were used by some rock groups. 

Garth Hudson, the keyboardist of The Band, played a Lowrey Festival organ on many of the group's most notable songs.
Its sound can be heard prominently on the 1968 recording of "Chest Fever", which begins with a Bach-inspired prelude/intro. 

The Beatles' 1967 song "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" included use of a Lowrey organ. It was used to help create a fairground atmosphere. 
A Lowrey DSO Heritage organ was used to produce the opening for "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds".

The Who song "Baba O'Riley" used a Lowrey Organ, on a percussive "marimba repeat" setting, to give the synthesizer-like background noise. 

Mike Oldfield made use of the instrument quite extensively on his "Tubular Bells" album, and on several later albums as well. The Gotye song "State of the Art" was written to showcase the sounds of the Lowrey Cotillion model D-575.

From 1966 to 1971, Lowrey produced combo organs for the guitar maker Gibson. The most popular of these was made in 1966, called the Kalamazoo K-101, but was soon renamed the Gibson G-101. The Gibson branded organs' design and circuitry were based on Lowrey's "T-1", "T-2", "TLO-R" and "Holiday" spinet models. They had several additional features that made their sound distinctive from the Lowrey models. The extra effects included "Repeat", "Glide", and "Trumpet Wow-wow".

In the late 1970s, selling features of Lowrey home organs included Magic Genie Chords, Track III Rhythm and the Automatic Organ Computer.

In the 1980s, Lowrey launched the MicroGenie series of portable organs. These had built-in speakers. Some models could run on batteries. They including the MicroGenie V60, V100/101, V105, V120, V125 and MicroGenie Pro V600 (which was programmable and had MIDI capability).

In 1988, Lowrey was purchased by Kawai. 

On October 5, 2018, Vice-President of Lowery Division of Kawai America Corp., Seijiro Imamura, announced that Lowery Organ production would cease in January 2019.

As Ifugao has a matrilineal culture, it is usually the wife who leads in these stories, and her brother occupies a higher position than her husband. Thus, the hudhud has value as an anthropological document. The language of stories, rich in figurative expressions and repetitions, uses metonymies, metaphors and onomatopoeias, which makes transcription very difficult. There are very few written documents of this tradition. The stories evoke ancient heroes, religious beliefs, traditional practices, and reflect the importance of rice cultivation. The narrators, especially the older women, occupy important positions in the community, as priestesses and as holders of history. The hudhud epics are alternately sung by the first reciter and the choir.

Ifugao's conversion to Catholicism weakened his traditional culture. The hudhud has been associated with manual rice harvesting, and this task is now mechanized.The terraced rice fields are inscribed on the World Heritage List under the name " Terraced Rice Fields of the Philippine Ranges ", the number of farmers is constantly falling. The last reciters are already very old and need support in their efforts to transmit their knowledge and sensitize young people. But with support from organizations including the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), the hudhud is increasingly being appreciated by the younger Ifugaos today.

In 2008 UNESCO integrated the "Hudhud, sung accounts of the Ifugao" into the representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

To encourage the involvement of the community and to ensure the continuous practice of the hudhud in its social-cultural context, the Hudhud Perpetual Award was created and launched in 2006. The annual award encourages the chanting of the stories during harvests, wakes, and bone washing (bogwa) occasions in the participating municipalities.

The sides were made from corrugated steel sheets. The two ends were covered with plywood which had doors and windows. The inside was insulated and had pressed wood lining and a wood floor. The building could be placed on concrete, on pilings, or directly on the ground with a wood floor. The inside space was open, so it could be used for a variety of purposes. Some uses were as barracks, latrines, medical and dental offices, isolation wards, housing, and bakeries.
About 150,000 to 170,000 Quonset huts were made during World War II. The military then sold the extra huts to the public after the war. Many are still used in the United States for various purposes. Some are also still in active use at the United States military bases.

Sexual consent

Sexual consent is consent to engage in sexual activity.

Sexual activity without consent is considered rape or other sexual assault. However, consent does not always mean the activity is legal.

Each country has an age of consent, which sets a minimum age at which a person can legally consent to have sexual intercourse.

Sexual consent relies on both partners of sexual activity to agree on doing sexual activity. Often, a person will say to their partner that they have sexual consent. However, just because someone appears to have sexual consent does not mean it is legal. Some people are legally considered unable to truly make full consent (such as a minor or a drunk person). People may also consent to unwanted sexual activity.

Consent

Consent occurs when one person voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another. It is a term of common speech, with specific definitions as used in such fields as the law, medicine, research, and sexual relationships.

The person agreeing must meet certain criteria: 

There are several types of consent commonly used in a variety of different situations. The types of consent, and how to use them, may be very important.

Sexual consent is the agreement to have sex/a sexual relationship. A lack of consent in this situation, mainly a lack of consent before sex, is often referred to as rape (A highly illegal activity).

Planck epoch

The Planck epoch is the earliest period of time in the history of the universe, before the time passed was equal to the Planck time (tₚ) ; that is from zero to approximately 10⁻⁴³ seconds. The Planck scale is the physical scale beyond which current physical theories may not apply and cannot be used to calculate what happened. At this time scale, all physical quantities like temperatures, energies etc were in the range of Planck units values. During the Planck epoch, the temperature and average energies within the universe were so high that even subatomic particles could not form and even the four fundamental forces that shape our universe were combined and formed one unified fundamental force.

Traditional Big Bang cosmology predicts a gravitational singularity before this time, but this theory relies on the theory of general relativity, which is thought to break down for this epoch due to quantum effects. Due to the extraordinarily small scale of the universe at that time, the quantum effects of gravity were the strongest and it is believed that cosmology and physics are assumed to have been dominated by the quantum effects of gravity. At this scale, the unified force is assumed to be unified with gravitation. Immeasurably hot and dense state of the Planck epoch is succeeded by the grand unification epoch, where gravitation force is separated from the unified fundamental force.

Golden algae

The Chrysophyceae (golden-brown algae or golden algae) are a large group of algae found mostly in freshwater. 

Golden algae is also a common term. It refers to a species, "Prymnesium parvum", which kills fish in large numbers (causes 'fish kills').
The main type of chrysophyte cell has two specialized flagella. The active, "feathered" flagellum points toward the moving direction. The smooth passive flagellum, points in the opposite direction.

An important characteristic used to identify members of the Chrysophyceae is the presence of a siliceous cyst that is formed internally.

However, some members of the group are amoeboid (move like amoeba), and some are sessile. Unfortunately, every expert who has studied this group has come up with a different classification. It seems that their ancestor did not do photosynthesis, but later on groups separately evolved their own methods of using sunlight.

Derby Playhouse was a theatre production company based in Derby. It was also the former name of the theatre it owned and operated. The theatre opened in 1975. In 2008, the company ceased and the theatre closed. 
The Derby Playhouse company had a national reputation for its productions. It premiered new theatrical works and the regional premieres of others.

In 1948, the original Playhouse opened as the Little Theatre in a converted church hall on Becket Street. 
In 1952, the company moved to a venue in Sacheverel Street.
In 1956, it survived a major fire.

In the 1960s and early 1970s the British government invested in the Arts Council of Great Britain's "Housing the Arts" fund. The fund enabled cities to renovate existing theatres and commission new ones. In response, the company formed the New Theatre Trust to fund its own purpose-built theatre. Roderick Ham was commissioned to design the new theatre. 
Derby City Council offered the land. This was part of the new Eagle Centre shopping development. 
The new Derby Playhouse was opened on 20 September 1975 by the 11th Duke of Devonshire. It had a seating capacity of 535.
In 2002, the company had money problems. It had a debt of £400,000, the biggest in its history, and it nearly closed. 
By 2004 it had recovered and was breaking box-office records.

In 2007, the company again ran into serious money problems. The Board of Trustees of the theatre asked Derby City Council to advance £40,000 from their 2008 grant. It was refused. On 29 November, the Board of Trustees of the theatre announced that it was going into voluntary liquidation and that performances would immediately stop. 
Nevertheless, the cast and crew of "Treasure Island" put on that evening's performance. 
After the curtain call, the cast were joined on stage by the staff, the theatre's chief executive and director of the show (Karen Hebden), and two former chairmen of the Playhouse board (Michael Hall, and Jonathan Powers). They addressed the audience and press and asked them to fight for the city's theatre and get the Playhouse open again. 
The following day, the Board of Trustees announced that the company had been put into administration.

The administrators allowed the Playhouse to reopen on 7 December 2007 to finish its run of "Treasure Island". 
The theatre was being operated by a skeleton of essential staff, initially working unpaid. A fund was set up to accept donations to keep the Playhouse going. It was now operating as a charitable trust and relied on ticket sales and donations alone. Tickets for a Spring/Summer 2008 season had already been on sale before the closure. They were put back on sale while an appeal was made to the Arts Council. The Arts Council refused the appeal in January 2008. The theatre closed after the last performance of "Treasure Island" on 2 February 2008.

During this period, the theatre's productions became known for the strength of their on-stage visual imagery. The Playhouse was shortlisted for the Prudential Awards.
In the summer of 1990, Derbyshire County Council cut their entire arts budget. This took £130,000 of revenue grant from the Playhouse. 
The City Council offered the theatre a small grant. This enabled the Playhouse to continue to operate. According to Lyn Gardner writing in "The Guardian", "it was Castledine's head that was demanded by the council as the price of underwriting the theatre's deficit." Castledine left the Playhouse.

From the summer of 1990 to Christmas 1991, Executive Director, David Edwards, was in charge of the programme. This ended with the Playhouse's production of "Hobson's Choice". This won the Theatrical Management Association's Regional Theatre Award for Best Overall Production.

Musicals became an important part of the programme, including "Grease", "Little Shop of Horrors", "Cabaret" and "Assassins". The pantomimes written by Mark Clements and Michael Vivian drew in record numbers at Christmas time.
In 2002, Mark Clements and David Edwards left the company. Karen Hebden was appointed as chief executive and Stephen Edwards as Creative Producer. Over the following years the Playhouse gained a national reputation for its productions.

Geezer Butler

Terence Michael Joseph "Geezer" Butler (born 17 July 1949) is an English musician and songwriter. Butler is best known as the bassist and primary lyricist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath. He has also recorded and performed with Heaven and Hell, GZR, and Ozzy Osbourne. He was the bassist of Deadland Ritual from 2017-2021.

Butler received the nickname "Geezer" when he was about eight years old. This was because he "used to call everybody Geezer" at school. "It was just a slang term for a man." 

Butler grew up in a working-class Irish Catholic family in Birmingham. Butler was one of seven children. The family were poor.

As a teenager, Butler was heavily influenced by the writing of Aleister Crowley. By his late teens, he had stopped attending Mass. He feels that everyone should sooner or later decide for themselves what to believe in. "I was going to Mass every Sunday just to take a look at all the nice girls that were going there". 

In autumn 1967, Butler formed his first band, Rare Breed. John "Ozzy" Osbourne joined as lead vocalist. Butler was dating a girl who lived near Tony Iommi. Iommi's earliest memories of Butler was of seeing him walking past his house every day to visit her. Iommi and Butler became acquainted when their bands played at a nearby nightclub. Butler and Osbourne joined guitarist Iommi and drummer Bill Ward in the band Polka Tulk. They renamed their new band Earth, but a band already existed with that name, so they were forced to change the name again. In early 1969, inspired by the Boris Karloff horror film of the same name, Butler suggested the name Black Sabbath.

In his pre-Sabbath days, inspired by John Lennon, Butler played rhythm guitar. When Sabbath was formed, Iommi made it clear that he did not want to play with another guitarist, so Butler moved to bass. According to Butler, "I'd never played bass until I was on stage at the first gig that we played. Borrowed the bass guitar off one of my friends and it only had three strings on it." 
Butler lists Jack Bruce of Cream as his biggest influence as a bassist. Iommi described Butler as being "from another planet" in the band's early days; he took LSD, wore Indian hippie dresses, and was very peaceful. At the time Black Sabbath was formed, Butler was studying to become an accountant, and this training resulted in him managing the band's finances in the early days.

After Black Sabbath fired vocalist Ozzy Osbourne in 1979, Butler also briefly left the band to deal with the divorce from his first wife. The 1980 album "Heaven and Hell" was recorded with bassist Craig Gruber but Butler returned to the band at the last minute and re-recorded the bass parts prior to release. 

In 1984, he left the band after touring in support of their 1983 album, "Born Again". He returned months later as the band attempted a comeback with vocalist David Donato. 

In 1988, Butler joined the backing band of his former Sabbath bandmate, Osbourne, to take part in the "No Rest for the Wicked" World Tour. 

In 1991, he rejoined Black Sabbath for the reunion of the "Mob Rules" line-up.

In 1994, he left again after the "Cross Purposes" tour.

In 1995 Butler again joined Osbourne's band to perform on the "Ozzmosis" album. After recording "Ozzmosis", he formed G/Z/R, issuing "Plastic Planet" the same year.

In 1997, he released his next solo album, "Black Science,". 

Butler returned to Sabbath for the 1997 edition of Ozzfest. He has remained with the band since. 

In 2005 he released "Ohmwork", his third solo album.

In October 2006 it was announced that Butler, along with Tony Iommi, would be reforming the "Dehumanizer"-era Black Sabbath line-up with Vinny Appice and Ronnie James Dio, under the name Heaven & Hell to differentiate between the reunited touring band fronted by Osbourne, and the current Sabbath line-up. 

In 2013, he recorded on the Black Sabbath album "13" and was on the supporting album tour.

In 2017, toured on the final Black Sabbath tour, The End Tour.

Butler is married to Gloria Butler, who managed Heaven & Hell. He was divorced from his first wife in 1980. He also shares his Los Angeles home with several cats, of whom he has posted pictures on his website. His oldest son, Biff Butler, was the frontman in the nu metal band Apartment 26. Butler's younger son James has a degree in social sciences from Oxford University.

Butler is a lifelong supporter of Aston Villa Football Club. During Black Sabbath's induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Butler is heard shouting "Up the Villa" as the members of the band left the stage. He has referred to soccer as his "religion" and has stated that Villa legend Peter McParland is his "all-time hero".

According to Osbourne, Butler "never uses foul language". He was raised on a vegetarian diet, largely due to his family being too poor to buy meat on a regular basis, and is now a vegan since about 1994. His mother was also a vegetarian.

In 2009, Butler appeared in a promotional ad for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He later urged fans to boycott Fortnum & Mason until they remove foie gras from their shelves. Butler said, "I've seen some outrageous things in my time, but watching those poor birds suffer simply so that their diseased livers can be sold on your shop floor is horrific!"

Over the years, Butler has become disillusioned with politics, saying "For me, it's almost pointless voting anymore because it seems to be the same no matter what party or politics you stand for. It all seems corrupted to me. It's all the same old people that rule the world." He has also expressed concern over the increasing level of control government has in people's lives. "Every time I go back to England, there are things that totally surprise me that you never think would happen in England, just all the CCTV everywhere. There seems to be so much control over people these days", he said in 2014.

In January 2015, Butler was briefly detained after a bar brawl in Death Valley, California and charged with misdemeanor assault, public intoxication and vandalism. He was released following detoxification and a citation. In 2016 he opened up about the event: "This guy started mouthing off about something. He was, like, some drunken Nazi bloke. He [...] started going on about Jews and everything - Jews this, Jews that. My missus is Jewish and I'd just had enough, and me hand sort of met his chin. I whacked him one."

Butler is noted as being one of the first bassists to use a wah pedal and to down-tune his instrument (from the standard E-A-D-G to the lower C#-F#-B-E), as on Black Sabbath's "Master of Reality" album. This was to match Iommi who had started tuning his guitar to C# (a minor third down). During the band's Ozzy Osbourne era, Butler wrote almost all of the band's lyrics, drawing heavily upon his fascination with religion, science-fiction, fantasy and horror, and musings on the darker side of human nature that posed a constant threat of global annihilation.

Butler is regarded as one of the most influential bassists in heavy metal. Billy Sheehan of Mr. Big said: "He’s a founding father of a whole genre of music and a man who really set the bar early on to be such an integral part of the sound and song structure of Sabbath". 
In Mick Wall's biography of Iron Maiden entitled "Run to the Hills", founder Steve Harris recalls: "I distinctly remember trying to play along to Black Sabbath's "Paranoid" – at first I just could not get it. I threw the guitar on my bed and walked out in a huff, but the next day I came back, picked it up and played it all the way through note-for-note! Once I got going, I started getting into bass-lines with a bit more subtlety to them...".

Former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted, who defined him his "number 1 influence", stated: "All true metal bassists look up to Geezer as a pioneer and Godfather of our chosen instrument. The best, ever". 
Rex Brown of Pantera and Kill Devil Hill asserted: "He’s a legend. He’s everything. Geezer is so much of an influence on me. 
Other bassists such as Cliff Burton, 
Les Claypool, Steve DiGiorgio, 
Alex Webster, 
John Myung, 
Johnny Lee Middleton, 
Greg Smith cited Butler as a significant influence on their style.

Butler currently endorses Lakland basses and has his own signature model. For amplification, Butler is endorsed by Hartke bass amplification, "Kilo" bass head and 4X10 HyDrive cabinet. In the past, he has been known to use Ampeg SVT & B-15 bass amps and Fender, Dan Armstrong Plexi, Rickenbacker, Yamaha BB, Vigier and B.C. Rich Basses.

According to the Geezer Butler Bass Rig Rundown, he used the following over the years.

This Earth of Mankind

This Earth of Mankind is the first book in Pramoedya Ananta Toer's "Buru Quartet". Hasta Mitra first published it in 1980. The story happens at the end of the Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia. Pramoedya wrote the novel in prison on Buru island in eastern Indonesia. Pramoedya told the story aloud to other prisoners in 1973 because he was not allowed to write. The story spread through all the prisoners until 1975. Then Pramoedya was finally allowed to write the full story.

The main character and narrator of "This Earth of Mankind" is a Javanese boy named Minke. He attends an elite Dutch school. Minke's life becomes dangerous when he falls in love with Annelies, the beautiful Indo daughter of Nyai Ontosoroh. In "This Earth of Mankind", Pramoedya showed the racism of the Dutch colony. 

The Indonesian Attorney General banned "This Earth of Mankind" in 1981. Many copies of the first editions survived. In 2005 the publisher Lentera Depantara started to publish it again in Indonesia. It had already been published worldwide in 33 languages.

"This Earth of Mankind" tells the story of Minke. He is a Javanese minor royal who studies at a Dutch "Hogere Burger School". At that time, usually only Europeans could study there. Minke is a talented young writer. His writing is published in several Dutch-language journals. They are popular. But many of Minke's classmates hate him because he is "native". His classmates are all at least partly European descent.

Minke meets an unusual Indonesian woman, Nyai Ontosoroh. She is the concubine of a Dutch man called Herman Mellema. Minke falls in love with their daughter, Annelies. They marry in an Islamic wedding. But by Dutch law, they are not marriedbecause it was "native" and Annelies' Dutch guardians did not approve.

It was common for local women to become the concubines of Dutch men living in the East Indies. Their children were either illegitimate "natives" and lost legal rights. Or if their father accepted them as his children they were called "Indos". Then the mother lost all rights over their children. Nyai Ontosoro suffers because of her low status and lack of rights. But, she believes education is the way to show her basic humanity. She believes that learning is the way to oppose racism, stupidity, and poverty. However, deciding to make her children Herman Mellema's children causes terrible problems for them.

After release from detention in April 1980 Pramoedya and Hasjim Rachman met with Joesoef Isak. Rachman had been editor of the "Eastern Star". Isak used to be a journalist at the "Merdeka" newspaper. He had been in Salemba prison. They agreed to publish works by ex-political prisoners that other publishers would not.

They chose "This Earth of Mankind" ("Bumi Manusia") as the first book. Pramoedya began working hard on the papers that he had brought from the Buru island. Prison officials had taken most of his writing. At the same time, Hasjim and Joesoef talked to government officials, including the Vice-President, Adam Malik. They were positive about the plans.

In July 1980, the manuscript of "This Earth of Mankind" was sent to the Aga Press printers. 5,000 copies of "This Earth of Mankind" sold in 12 days. Soon other publishers in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Netherlands, and Australia asked the publishers, Hasta Mitra, for permission to make translations. The Wira Karya publishing house in Malaysia paid royalties of as much as 12% direct to Pramoedya.

By November, Hasta Mitra had published its third edition, and had sold about 10,000 copies. The book was well-received critically. It was called "the best work of literature of our times." The Armed Forces daily newspaper called it "a new contribution to the treasury of Indonesian literature".

the Attorney General of Indonesia banned "This Earth of Mankind" in 1981. He said it promoted Marxist-Leninist ideas and Communism. Neither are in the book.

First, the Ampat Lima printing house were told to not print any books published by Hasta Mitra. The editors of major media were told that they were not allowed to review or praise "This Earth of Mankind" or any of Pramoedya's other writing.

In April 1981, some New Order youth groups criticized Pramoedya's writing. Mass media reported this as the people not liking Pramoedya's work. New Order media such as "Suara Karya", "Pelita" and "Karya Dharma" began publishing criticisms of "This Earth of Mankind" and its author.

The Association of Indonesian Publishers (IKAPI) had been planning an exhibition of books that year. They canceled Hasta Mitra's membership in the association. IKAPI had been enthusiastic about asking the publisher to become a member and be involved in its activities. Newspapers that used to support Pramoedya stopped publishing his writing. They also started rejecting writing by authors who supported Pramoedya.

Finally, on 29 May 1981, the Attorney General published regulation SK-052/JA/5/1981 about the banning of "This Earth of Mankind" and its sequel "Child of All Nations (Anak Semua Bangsa)". The regulation mentioned a letter from Suharto.

The Attorney General's office took all copies of "This Earth of Mankind" and "Child of All Nations" tried to take all copies of the books from all book shops. However, by August 1981, they only took 972 copies of the books although about 20,000 copies had been printed.

The translator of "This Earth of Mankind" into English, Maxwell Lane, was a staff member of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta. The Australian Government recalled him in September 1981. The Ampat Lima printing company closed because of pressure from the Attorney General's office and the Interior Ministry.


"This Earth of Mankind" was made into an Indonesian language movie. Production started in 2006. Armantono wrote the script.

Zero-sum game

A zero-sum game is a term in game theory and economic theory. 

It is a mathematical representation of a situation. Each individual's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will add up to zero. So, cutting a cake is a zero-sum game. 

Not so obvious, but essential, is "how players (participants) value the cake". A zero-sum game exists if and only if all players value the cake equally (see marginal utility).

Hapi (Nile god)

Hapi was the god of the annual flooding of the Nile in ancient Egyptian religion. The flood deposited fertile soil on the river's banks, allowing the Egyptians to grow crops. Hapi was greatly celebrated among the Egyptians. Some of the titles of Hapi were "Lord of the Fish and Birds of the Marshes" and "Lord of the River Bringing Vegetation". Hapi is typically depicted as an androgynous figure with a big belly and large drooping breasts, wearing a loincloth and ceremonial false beard.

The annual flooding of the Nile occasionally was said to be the "Arrival of Hapi". Since this flooding provided fertile soil in an area that was otherwise desert, Hapi symbolized fertility. He had large female breasts because he was said to bring a rich and nourishing harvest. Due to his fertile nature he was sometimes considered the "father of the gods", and was considered to be a caring father who helped to maintain the balance of the cosmos, the world or universe regarded as an orderly, harmonious system. He was thought to live within a cavern at the supposed source of the Nile near Aswan. The cult of Hapi was mainly located at the First Cataract named Elephantine. His priests were involved in rituals to ensure the steady levels of flow required from the annual flood. At Elephantine the official nilometer, a measuring device, was carefully monitored to predict the level of the flood, and his priests must have been intimately concerned with its monitoring.

Hapi was not regarded as the god of the Nile itself but of the flooding event. He was also considered a "friend of Geb" the Egyptian god of the earth, and the "lord of Neper", the god of grain.

Although male and wearing the false beard, Hapi was pictured with pendulous breasts and a large stomach, as representations of the fertility of the Nile. He also was usually given blue or green skin, representing water. Other attributes varied, depending upon the region of Egypt in which the depictions exist. In Lower Egypt, he was adorned with papyrus plants and attended by frogs, present in the region, and symbols of it. Whereas in Upper Egypt, it was the lotus and crocodiles which were more present in the Nile, thus these were the symbols of the region, and those associated with Hapi there. Hapi often was pictured carrying offerings of food or pouring water from an amphora, but also, very rarely, was depicted as a hippopotamus. During the Nineteenth Dynasty Hapi is often depicted as a pair of figures, each holding and tying together the long stem of two plants representing Upper and Lower Egypt, symbolically binding the two halves of the country around a hieroglyph meaning "union". This symbolic representation was often carved at the base of seated statues of the pharaoh.

Egyptian historian Al Maqrizi (1364–1442) related in his "El Khutat El Maqrizia (The Maqrizian Plans) that living virgins were sacrificed annually as "brides of the Nile" ("Arous El Nil") and this has been historically accepted as late as the 1970s. but this claim is disputed by some Egyptologists such as Bassam El Shammaa.

Flooding of the Nile

Before the Aswan Dam was built (1898-1902). there was a Nile flood, once a year. This flood carried rich sediments, which made the soil fertile. Egypt is located in the desert, and agriculture is only possible close to the Nile. A rainy season in Ethiopia starts the flooding, which used to occur between May and August. During this time, the Blue Nile has five times as much water as the White Nile. During the rest of the year, the White Nile has almost twice as much water than the Blue Nile. This event was visible in Aswan, starting in June, and reaching its peak in August. The water reaches the eastuary of the Nile about two weeks later.

The flooding always occurs at the same time; in some years it may be a few days erlier, in others it will be a few days later. What cannot be prediced is the total amount of water. Little water meant droughts and famine. Too much water would cause damage to dams and houses.

Internet Protocol television

Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) is the delivery of television content over Internet. With cable or satellite TV, broadcasters send out signals and viewers receive them—you’re only able to watch what’s being broadcasted. IPTV is different. Instead of transmitting content via light pulses in fiber-optic cable or radio waves from a satellite, IPTV sends shows and movies through your standard internet connection.

In its simplest form, IPTV delivers television content over a closed network using the Internet Protocol (IP) instead of traditional satellite signal or cable TV formats.

This means that instead of your television provider sending a signal to your TV via a physical cable, that signal is instead sent over the internet. This has a few advantages – most notably, it allows you to view television content anywhere you have an internet connection.

It also opens up new possibilities regarding content delivery, Interactivity, and impossible features with traditional television formats.

IPTV is a video-streaming technology that delivers television programs over the internet. IPTV provides television content using the internet protocol suite instead of being delivered through traditional terrestrial, satellite signal, or cable television formats.

IP-based television allows for a more customized experience for users. It also enables service providers to offer more features such as video on demand (VOD), interactive applications, and games. In addition, IPTV can be integrated with other types of broadband services, such as internet telephony and data over cable service (DOCSIS).

An IPTV service offers several benefits for those looking to improve their property. The most apparent use is receiving television channels without needing a satellite dish or cable box. This can save you both time and money., as you will no longer need to pay installation or equipment rental fees.

Additionally, an IPTV connection usually provides a clearer picture than a traditional cable or satellite, using your home’s existing broadband internet connection. This also means you can watch TV on any compatible device connected to your network, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops. And because IPTV services are delivered over the internet, you can often sign up for a package that includes international channels, giving you access to a wider range of programming than what is available through traditional providers.

Eklutna Lake

Eklutna Lake is a large, glacier-fed lake to the north of the city of Anchorage, Alaska. The lake is the city's main source of water and also helps create electric power for the city.

The lake is also part of the city's large park system. It is inside Chugach state park, one of the largest state parks in the United States. People who visit may walk the long trails or camp out between the tall mountains that surround the lake. In the winter, skiing and ice skating are popular activities.

The road from the Glenn Highway out of Anchorage to the lake is ten miles long. It also climbs high into the hills as it nears the campground. Many who enjoy the drive say that it is one of the most scenic drives in Alaska.

Two dams have been used to make electricity. The first was built in 1929 and worked for more than 30 years. It stopped being used in 1955 and was torn down in 2017. The new dam was built in 1951 and moves water through a tunnel to a generator used to make electricity for the city. This dam still serves the city.

The lake and the river leading from it all come from melted snow high in the mountains. The city takes the water from the lake near the dam and treats it to remove germs and sand. It gives the city nearly 90% of its water. At least one company bottles water directly from Eklutna Lake to sell in stores around the country.

Hadesarchaea

Hadesarchaea are very small living things. They are thermophile Archaea that live in very hot places underground. People have found them in sand at the bottom of the ocean, deep mines, hot springs, and other places underground.

Hadesarchaea were first called the South-African Gold Mine Miscellaneous Euryarchaeal Group (SAGMEG) because they were found in a gold mine in South Africa. They were renamed "Hadesarchaea" in 2016 (Hades was the Greek god who ruled the land of the dead).

In 2016, scientists used a method called shotgun sequencing to make a model of the Hadesarchaea genome. A genome is all the genes in an living thing and the other pieces of DNA and RNA that help them work. The Hadesarchaea genome is about 1.5 Megabase pairs in size, which is about 0.5 Mbp smaller than most other Archaea. The scientists think the small genome is how the Hadesarchaea can stay alive with only a little to eat.

Scientists believe Hadesarchaea came from an ancestor that used methane as food.

The first Hadesarchaea that people found were in a mine in South Africa about 3 km (2 mi) under the surface of the Earth. They do not need oxygen or light to live. They were later also found in the White Oak River estuary in North Carolina, a place where a river meets the ocean, and in Yellowstone National Park's Lower Culex Basin. These areas are hot, 70 °C (158 °F), and are so alkaline that they would destroy most living things. Other scientists looked through the soil near old mines in East Harz, Germany and think they may have found pieces of 16S rRNA that could be from Hadesarchaea or their close relatives.

Hadesarchaea are the only archaea that can turn carbon monoxide and water into carbon dioxide and oxygen. When they do this, the reaction gives off hydrogen. Scientists looked at more information about the Hadesarchaea genome and believe they have genes that let them put carbon atoms into other molecules and make methane. Other scientists think Hadesarchaea may be able to use sugar and amino acids as fuel and change nitrite into ammonium. Scientists think Hadesarchaea help in geochemical processes.

Subdural hematoma

A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a type of bleeding in which a collection of blood usually caused from a traumatic brain injury—gathers in the inner layer of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater of the meninges surrounding the brain. It usually results from tears in bridging veins that cross the subdural space.

The symptoms of a subdural hematoma are slow to notice because the lower-pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries. Signs and symptoms of acute hematomas may appear in minutes, if not immediately, but can also be delayed as much as two weeks.

Buru

Buru is an island in Indonesia. About a third of the people are indigenous, mostly Buru, but also Lisela, Ambelau and Kayeli people. Between 1658 and 1942, Buru was colonised by the Dutch East India Company and then by the Crown of the Netherlands. The Japanese army had the island between 1942 and 1945. In 1950, it became part of independent Indonesia. During president Suharto's New Order administration in the 1960s–1970s, Buru was a prison for thousands of political prisoners. The famous Indonesian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer wrote most of his novels, including "Buru Quartet" in that prison.

Buru island is between two seas of the Pacific Ocean – Seram Sea () on the north and Banda Sea () to the south and west. To the east, is the Manipa Strait () then Seram Island (). The area of Buru is . Buru is the third largest Maluku Islands.

Buru is shaped like an oval. It is about from east to west and from north to south. The highest point on the island () is the peak of Mount Kapalatmada. The island is mostly mountainous, especially in the central and western parts. Much of the island is covered with tropical rain forest.

Buru is between Australia and Asia. Its plants and animals are unique.

The island belongs to the Indonesian province of Maluku (). It is split into Buru Regency () and South Buru Regency ().
As of the 2010 Census, the population of the islands administered as Buru was 161,828 people; at the 2015 Intermediate Census this rose to 186,779. About 68.3% in the northern regency and 31.7% in the southern;

One of the first mentions of Buru is in the Nagarakretagama in 1365. That is an Old Javanese funeral speech for Hayam Wuruk, the ruler of the Majapahit Kingdom.

In the 16th–17th centuries Buru was claimed by the rulers of Ternate island and by the Portuguese. But neither nation controlled the island. They only visited it for trade. Makassar people from Sulawesi island built fortifications on Buru. The Makassars forced the locals to grow valuable spices, such as clove.

The Makassars and Dutch East India Company both wanted the spices in the east of the Malay archipelago. They fought a war. In 1648, the Dutch forced the Makassar out of Buru. The Dutch destroyed farms and buildings because they could not stay on Buru and afraid that the Makassars might come back. They came back with with four cannon and staffed by 24 soldiers in 1658 at the southern coast of Kayeli Bay. They built a permanent settlement and fortress. The Dutch forced about 2,000 local island people to move to Kayeli Bay. Many of them were nobles. The Dutch wanted to control the local people and make them work in the clove fields. These local Kayeli people became important leaders.

The Dutch East India Company ended in the early 18th century. All its land in the Malay archipelago became property of the Dutch crown. Buru was divided into regencies. Local rulers called rajascontrolled the regencies for the Dutch. All rajas were Kayeli tribal nobles.

The demise of Kayeli dominance began in the 1880s, when the leaders of Leliali, Wae Sama and Fogi clans moved significant parts of their ethnic groups to their original settlements; they were joined in the early 1900s by Tagalisa. By then, many other of the original 13 Kayeli villages were either abandoned or had lost their rajas. By about 1910, the leading role of the Kayeli clan had almost disappeared.

From the spring of 1942 to the summer of 1945, the Japanese army controlled all of the Dutch East Indies, including Buru. The island was bombed by the Allies planes. They were attacking the Namlea Airport.

After Japan lost the war, control of the island went back to the Netherlands. In December 1946, Buru, along with the other Maluku Islands, Sulawesi and Lesser Sunda Islands, was included in a partly independent State of East Indonesia. It was set up by the Dutch government. They planned to let their East Indies slowly become a dependent state. In December 1949, eastern Indonesia joined the Republic of the United States of Indonesia.

In April 1950, Buru, Ambon, Seram and some smaller nearby islands started an independent Republic of South Moluccas. They promised to keep close political ties with the Netherlands. The Republic of Indonesia tried to absorb the RMS by talking. But, this failed. So, the Republic of Indonesia started a six-month war in July 1950. In December 1950, the Republic of Indonesia controlled Buru and it became part of the Republic of Indonesia.

Between 1950 and 1965, the new government wanted to make Buru part of Indonesia. In the 1960s and 1970s, during the military regime of General Suharto, Buru became a main prison. Most prisoners were Communists and other left-wing representatives, and intellectuals. Most camps on Buru were closed in 1980. More than 12,000 people had been prisoners. At least several hundred had died or been killed.

One of the prisoners was an Indonesian writer, Pramoedya Ananta Toer. He was in prison for 14 years (1965–1979). He wrote there many of his novels, including most of "Buru Quartet". Until 1975, Toer was not allowed pencil or paper. He memorized his novels and told them to his cellmates. They helped him to remember the stories.

Buru is linked with other parts of Indonesia by sea. It has two main ports in Namlea and Namrole. The military airfield at Namlea (runway 750 meters) is used for air transportation. Most local transportation is on roads.

Traditionally, work and culture in villages changed with seasons and people moved to follow work. and food. Men hunted wild pigs called Buru babirusa, deer, and possum. Women gathered wild vegetables. During the west monsoon (November to April) both men and women worked together in the fields. The soil on the island was not good, so sometimes villages moved to newer, better soil. Sometimes people would move their whole village after some 20 years of using one piece of land. Most settlements were small. 

Traditional Buru clothes are similar those of most other Indonesia peoples. Men wear sarongs and a long-skirted tunic. Women also wear sarongs but a shorter jacket. Color of clothes is different for the different tribes of the island.

Both Indonesian and foreign scientists study the special plant and animal life on the island. But, the original plants on the coast and much of the mountain forest have been cut or destroyed for farming. Only two large areas rain forest are still in the mountains. These are protected areas called Gunung Kapalat Mada (1,380 km) and Waeapo (50 km).

Sentinel (sculpture)

Sentinel () is a 16m high sculpture by Tim Tolkien. It is on Spitfire Island, a roundabout at the intersection of the Chester Road and the A47 Fort Parkway at the entrance to the Castle Vale estate in Birmingham.

It is near Junction 5 of the M6 motorway and the Jaguar car factory. This used to be the Castle Bromwich aircraft factory. It shows three Spitfires peeling off up into the air in different directions. The half-scale Spitfires are made of aluminium, with curving steel supporting beams which act as vapour trails. It captures the dynamics of the Spitfire in flight and commemorates the nearby Castle Bromwich factory where most of Britain's wartime Spitfires were built.

The project began in 1997. The project has won awards. The project was part of the regeneration of the Castle Vale estate. It was funded by the National Lottery. Tolkien was appointed as artist in residence. He consulted local residents about an art feature. They liked the area's links to World War II aircraft. They would like a sculpture with Spitfires. The sculpture was opened on 14 November 2000. The sculptor is the great-nephew of J. R. R. Tolkien who was the author of "The Lord of the Rings," and who grew up in Birmingham.

The main commercial sponsors of the spitfire sculpture were from Jaguar, Rubery Owen Holdings and Cincinnati. Both Cincinnati and Rubery Owen Holdings made parts for the Spitfires. They were put together at the Castle Bromwich Spitfire and Avro Lancaster bomber factory. This is the factory where Jaguar cars are now made. 

The Castle Bromwich Aerodrome Factory was built in 1940 to produce planes for the war effort. About 12,000 Spitfires were made there from 1940 to 1945. Over 37,000 test flights were made from Castle Bromwich Aerodrome. The completed planes were towed across the road from the factory to the Aerodrome. The sculpture was unveiled by Alex Henshaw. He was the Chief Test Pilot for spitfires.

The aerodrome site is now the Castle Vale estate.

North Sulawesi

North Sulawesi () is a province of Indonesia. It is on the northeastern peninsula of the island of Sulawesi. This is called the Minahasa Peninsula. The province is south of the Philippines and southeast of Sabah, Malaysia. The Maluku Sea is to the east, the Gorontalo and Celebes Sea is to the west, and the Gulf of Tomini is to the southwest. The province's area is 13851.64 sq.km, and its population was 2,270,596 at the 2010 census;

The province's capital, business center, and largest city is Manado. Other major towns are Tomohon and Bitung. There are many tall mountains from high. The province is a young volcanic region. There are many eruptions and active volcanic cones.
In the past, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and the Kingdoms around this area fought over the riches in North Sulawesi such as spices, rice and gold. The region was also the trading route between west and east and this helped the spread of Christianity, Islam, and other religions. The Portuguese first landed in the 16th century. The Spanish and the Dutch came and the Portuguese fought them. Finally, the Dutch got control in the 17th century. The Dutch ruled the area for three centuries until the Japanese came at the start of World War II. After the Japanese lost WWII in 1945, the Dutch controlled the area again for a short time. They left in 1949. , following the Round Table Conference, in which the Dutch recognized the newly created United States of Indonesia (RIS). So, North Sulawesi became part of the territory of the State of East Indonesia (NIT). The people did not like NIT, so it became part of the Republic of Indonesia in 1950. At first, the island of Sulawesi was one single province. Soon it separated into several different provinces. So, the province of North Sulawesi started on 14 August 1959.

The area around North Sulawesi used to be called Minahasa. The name is still used sometimes. The word Minahasa comes from the words Mina-Esa (Minaesa) or Maesa which means being one or uniting This name shows hope to unite the ethnic groups of the area including the: Tontemboan, Tombulu, Tonsea, Tolour (Tondano), Tonsawang, Ponosakan, Pasan, and Bantik. The word "Minahasa" was first used by J.D. Schierstein, the Dutch regent of Manado, in his report to the Governor of Maluku on 8 October 1789.

Archaeological research has revealed signs of human life in North Sulawesi since 30,000 years ago, based on evidence in the cave Liang Sarru on the island of Salibabu. Other evidence shows life about 6,000 years ago on the Passo Hillside Site in Kakas District and 4,000 years ago to early AD at the Liang Tuo Mane'e cave in Arangkaa on Karakelang Island.

At the end of the 16th century, Portuguese and Spanish arrived in North Sulawesi. The Portugal was the first western nation to arrive in North Sulawesi. A Portuguese ship landed at Manado The Sultanate of Maguindanao controlled the northern islands at that time. The Portuguese built the fort at Amurang.

The Spanish ship docked on the island of Talaud and Siau, on to Ternate. Spain built the Fort in Manado, since then Minahasa started in control of Spain. The resistance against the Spanish occupation culminated in 1660–1664.

The Dutch ship landed in Manado City in 1660 in assisting the struggle of the Minahasa Confederation against Spain. The United Nations republican association of members of the Minahasa Confederation entered into a Trade Agreement with the VOC. This trade cooperation agreement then made the VOC monopolize the trade, which gradually began to impose its will, eventually leading to the 1700s resistance in Ratahan which culminated in the Dutch Minahasa-War in 1809–1811 at Tondano.

The Spanish had already colonized the Philippine Islands. They made Minahasa a coffee plantation. Spain made Manado a center of coffee trade for Chinese merchants. Some Minahasan tribes helped Spain capture the Portuguese fort at Amurang in the 1550s. The Spanish colonists then built the fort in Manado. Finally, Spain controlled all Minahasa.

In the 16th century one of the first Indo-Eurasian communities in the archipelago was in Manado. The first king of Manado was Muntu Untu (1630). He was half Spanish ancestry. Spain later gave Minahasa to the Portuguese in exchange for 350,000 ducats in a treaty. The rulers of Minahasa sent Supit, Pa'at, and Lontoh to fight with the Dutch to force the Portuguese out of Minahasa. They succeeded in 1655. They built their own fortress in 1658 and forced out the last Portuguese a few years later.

By the beginning of the 17th century the Dutch had overthrown the sultanate of Ternate. They began to reduce the power of Spain and Portugal in the archipelago. In 1677 the Dutch conquered the Sangir archipelago. Two years later, Robert Padtbrugge, the governor of Maluku, visited Manado. He made an agreement with the Minahasan chiefs. This let the Dutch dominate for the next 300 years. However, direct rule by the Dutch only began in 1870. The Dutch helped unite the Minahasa confederation. In 1693 the Minahnians won a military victory against the Mongondow tribe in the south. Dutch influence increased and Christianity and European culture grew in Minahasa. The missionary schools in Manado in 1881 were one of the first attempts of mass education in Indonesia. Graduates of the schools could find work as civil servants, in the army, and in the Dutch East Indies government. Minahasa relations with the Dutch were often poor. There was a war between the Dutch and Tondano in 1807 and 1809. The Minahasa territory was not under Dutch direct rule until 1870. But eventually the Dutch and Minahasa became very close. So, Minahasa was often called the 12th Dutch province. Even in 1947, Manado formed the political movement of Twapro, short for Twaalfde Profincie (Twelfth Province) who wanted formal integration of Minahasa into the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

The Japanese occupied the area from 1942 to 1945. was a period of deprivation, and the allied forces bombed Manado greatly in 1945. During the period of independence thereafter, there was a split between pro-Indonesian and pro-Dutch Minahasa. The appointment of Sam Ratulangi as the first East Indonesia governor then succeeded in winning Minahasa support to the Republic of Indonesia. After Indonesian independence, Indonesia is divided into 8 Provinces, and Sulawesi is one of these provinces. Sulawesi's first governor was S.G.J.Ratulangi, also known as a national hero. In 1948 in Sulawesi was formed the State of East Indonesia, which later became one of the states within the United States of Indonesia. The State of East Indonesia was dissolved, and merged into the Republic of Indonesia. Based on Law Number 13 Year 1964, formed North Sulawesi Province. 14 August 1959 was designated as the anniversary of the province.

In March 1957, North and South Sulawesi military leaders demanded more freedom from Java. They wanted more active development, sharing tax money fairly, and help against Kahar Muzakar's rebellion in South Sulawesi. They wanted a central government led by both Sukarno and Hatta equally. At first the movement of the 'Permesta' (Charter of the Struggle of the Universe) was merely a movement of reform rather than a separatist movement.

Negotiations between the central government and Sulawesi military leaders prevented violence in South Sulawesi, but Minahasan leaders were not satisfied with the outcome of the agreement and the movement broke out. Fearful of southern dominance, Minahasan leaders declared their own North Sulawesi autonomous state in June 1957. At that time the central government had controlled South Sulawesi, but in the North there were no strong figures of the central government and there were rumors that the United States was armed with rebellion in Sumatra North, also has links with Minahasan leaders.

The possibility of foreign intervention prompted the central government to request military assistance from southern Sulawesi. The Permesta forces were later removed from Central Sulawesi, Gorontalo, Sangir, and Morotai in Maluku. Permesta planes (supplied by the US and flown by Philippine, Taiwanese, and American Pilots) were destroyed. The US then moved on, and in June 1958 the central government army landed in Minahasa. The Permesta uprising ended in mid-1961.

The Sumatra and Sulawesi rebellions failed. They even helped to create what they did not want as the center reacted to the threat of rebellion. The central government authority increased while regional autonomy became weaker. Radical nationalism became stronger. Communist party power and Sukarno's power increased while Hatta weakened. Sukarno finally established guided democracy in 1958.

Since the 1998 reforms, the Indonesian government has begun to adopt laws that enhance regional autonomy, the main idea that Permesta fights for.

The other two provinces are North Sumatra and Aceh Special Region. North Sulawesi is near the equator at 0.30–4.30 North Latitude (Lu) and 121–127 East Longitude (BT). The peninsula stretches from east to west. The Sangihe and Talaud Islands are the parts of the province farthest north. These are North Sulawesi's boundaries:

Most of mainland North Sulawesi Province is mountains and hills with valleys in between. Some mountains in North Sulawesi are Mount Klabat (1,895 m) in North Minahasa, Mount Lokon (1,579 m), Mount Mahawu (1,331 m) in Tomohon, Mount Soputan (1,789 m) in Southeast Minahasa, Mount Dua Saudara (1,468 m) in Bitung, Mount Awu (1,784), Mount Space (1,245 m), Mount Karangketang (1,320 m), Mount Dalage (1,165 m), in Sangihe and Talaud, Mount Ambang (1,689 m), Mount Gambula (1954 m) and Mount Batu Balawan (1,970 m).

The two largest lakes are: Lake Tondano (area of 4,278 ha) in Minahasa and Lake Moat (area 617 ha) in East Bolaang Mongondow. The main rivers are Tondano River (40 km), Poigar River (54.2 km), Ranoyapo River (51.9 km), Talawaan River (34.8 km) in Minahasa. Dumoga River (87.2 km), Sangkub River (53.6 km), and Ongkaw River (42.1 km) are in Bolmong and Bolmut.

Along the coast of North Sulawesi, both on the mainland coast and on the coast of the islands, there are several headlands and bays. The soil in the area was fertile for agriculture.

Most of the plants and animals in North Sulawesi are like those in other parts of Indonesia. But, there are some animals in the province such as Deer, Maleo, Taong, Mini Tarsius Spectrum in Bitung City Nature Reserve And Coelacanth off the coast of Manado.

In the sea off North Sulawesi, there are several species of fish, coral, and plankton. Some marine fish are important sources of foreign exchange, including: tuna, skipjack, yellow tail, lobster, and others.

Much of North Sulawesi is forest. Forests start at sea level and may continue to mountain tops. Good quality timber, including ebony (wooden) iron wood, linggua, cempaka, wooden nantu, gopasa, and meranti. There are also plantation crops such as coconut, nutmeg, and cloves.

The largest ethnic groups are the Minahasan in the north of the province and the Mongondow to the south. The province's main city is Manado (population of 432,300 in 2019). In 2010, about 68% were Christian. Christians in North Sulawesi are mostly Protestant but there are also some Catholics. This is unusual in mostly Muslim Indonesia. Dutch missionaries were very successful during the colonial time. Also, because the Muslim-majority region of Gorontalo left North Sulawesi to become the new Gorontalo (province) in 2000. Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist minorities also live in the province. Manado also has a significant Judaism community. Currently, the only synagogue in Indonesia is in Manado.

Other ethnic groups are the Bolaang Mongondow, Sangihe, Talaud and Siau. Ethnicity in North Sulawesi is more heterogeneous then other parts of Indonesia. The Minahasan and Bolaang Mongondow are spread almost throughout the region of North Sulawesi mainland. The Sangihe, Talaud and Siau mostly inhabit the Sangihe Islands, Talaud Island, and Lembeh Island, especially in coastal areas north, east and west of mainland North Sulawesi. The Bajau people are seafaring nomads who has migrated from the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines, due to the conflict in Mindanao. They live in coastal villages of North Sulawesi in the northern part of North Minahasa Regency.

In addition to the natives, North Sulawesi is also home to migrants. There are a significant Chinese population in North Sulawesi, especially around the city of Manado. The Chinese are also one of the first people to have contact with the local people before the European came. According to the discovery of Chinese ancient letters in the Tompaso area, Minahasa shows the cultural interaction between the Chinese and Minahasa have existed since the Han dynasty. Most of the Chinese people in North Sulawesi are Hakka, but some Hokkien and Cantonese people also live there.

Other ethnic groups such as the Javanese and the Sundanese also exist. They are mostly migrated from where they come from due to the Transmigration program enacted by the Dutch during the colonial era until the Suharto era. They generally live in urban areas, such as Manado and Tomohon.

North Sulawesi is a multilingual culture. Many languages are used and people usually speak at least two and often more languages. Indonesian is the official language of the province an other parts of Indonesia. Official documents from the provincial government and road signs are all written in Indonesian. However, most people in the province communicate everyday in Manado Malay. This language is like Indonesian but not the same. Minahasan people speak Minahasan languages. These are the five Minahasan languages in the area: Tonsawang, Tontemboan, Toulour, Tonsea and Tombulu. To the south, people speak Mongondow language and Gorontalo language.

However, Atul in between in anger shoted bullets at Divya and her spirit began to disappear. Suddenly, all realised what had happened that day. Principle gave them lockets, which when on their body, save them from Divya and Kapil. Atul initially did not believed, but when the locket saved him from accident, he started believing in gods.

Atul started chasing Kapil in motorcycle, however his locket gets off from his body in between. He then got fatal blows from Kapil on his head. He shoted bullets at Kapil, but they had no effect on him. As he was about to lie on ground due to fatal injuries, Atul exploded a bomb on Kapil, and felled on the ground fainted, but he did not die. However, he goes into coma. The exploded body parts of Kapil came together and joined to again form Kapil.

Again, locket gets off and Atul gets brutally stabbed by Kapil on his stomach. He then gets another fatal blows from Kapil. As he was about to die, he runs to the Principle, requesting him to save Vivek at any cost. Principle promises him. Saying this, Atul dies in Principle's hands.

Urdish

Urdish (or Urglish), a portmanteau of Urdu and English, is the macaronic hybrid use of English and Urdu in Pakistan, involving code-switching between these languages where they are freely interchanged within a sentence or between sentences. The term "Urdlish" is first recorded in 1989. Other less common colloquial portmanteau words for Urdish include (chronologically): "Urglish" (recorded from 1995), "Urdlish" (1997) and "Urduish" (1998).

Many bilingual or multi-lingual Urdu speakers, being familiar with both Urdu and English, display code-switching in certain localities and between certain social groups.

On 14 August 2015, the Government of Pakistan launched the "Ilm" Pakistan movement, with a uniform curriculum in Urdish. Ahsan Iqbal, Federal Minister of Pakistan, said, "Now the government is working on a new curriculum to provide a new medium to the students which will be the combination of both Urdu and English and will name it Urdish."

Ballon d'Or

The Ballon d'Or is a special award given to a football player every single year. It has been given since 1956 by a French news magazine called "France Football". From 2010 to 2015, it was combined with another award called FIFA World Player of the Year, and together they were known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or. However, in 2016, they separated again, and the award returned to its original name, the Ballon d'Or. FIFA also started giving its own separate award called The Best FIFA Men's Player. 

The Ballon d'Or was created by sports writers Gabriel Hanot and Jacques Ferran. It is given to the male player who is considered to have performed the best in the previous season. Football journalists used to do the voting for this award from 1956 to 2006. At first, it was only given to players from Europe and was called the European Footballer of the Year award. But in 1995, it was expanded to include players from any part of the world who have played for European clubs. After 2007, coaches and captains of national teams were also allowed to vote. This made the award a global prize, and any professional football player from around the world became eligible to win it. In 2022, France Football changed some rules for the Ballon d'Or. They decided to give the award not for achievements in a calendar year but for a football season. They also made it so that only countries in the top 100 of the FIFA World Ranking could vote for the award. There is a different vote each year. It is for individual players to get recognised. Despite its popularity, critics have described the award as a "popularity contest", criticising its voting process and for systematically singling out an individual in a team sport.

E. E. Evans-Pritchard

Sir Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard, Kt FBA FRAI (21 September 1902 – 11 September 1973) was a British social anthropologist and ethnographer who is known for studying East African cultures and his early practice of cultural relativism.

Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard was born on September 21st, 1902 in Surrey, England. He was the son of a Reverend. He went to Winchester College in Hampshire, England. After, he went to Exeter College in Oxford for a master’s degree in Modern History. In 1927, he got his PhD from the London School of Economics. Evans-Pritchard married Ioma Nicholls in 1939 and the two of them had three sons and two daughters.

While at the London School of Economics, Evans-Pritchard was taught by the well-known C.G. Seligman and B. Malinowski and influenced by Alfred Radcliffe-Brown all of whom were important anthropologists. Evans-Pritchard, unlike his teachers, saw anthropology as less of a natural science and more about understanding culture and explaining history. Evans-Pritchard soon became known for studying the peoples of Eastern Africa. His PhD thesis was about the Azande people of modern South Sudan. He would continue to study and work with the Azande and other Eastern Africans throughout his life. He spent his time during the Second World War in Sudan and was able to study other East African peoples like the Sansui of Cyrenaica during his military service. At the time, Britain colonized many parts of Africa; Britain used their colonies as bases and staging posts during the war.

Evans-Pritchard’s spent much of his early career studying the Azande. He had a specific interest in the Azande idea of witchcraft, which to the Azande was of great importance. Whenever something bad, that was not someone’s fault, happened to a member of the Azande, they would blame witchcraft for the issue. Witchcraft was a common, everyday problem for the Azande and it was a major part of their culture. Tests and trials, often done by oracles, would decide whether accused people were witches or not. It is important to note that the Azande did not always believe witch charges and they often challenged rulings. As Evans-Pritchard found, Azande witchcraft was not an excuse for someone making a mistake. The Azande idea of witchcraft had a logic to it.

The Nuer people of people of East Africa were also studied by Evans-Pritchard. Like with the Azande, he took primary accounts of what he saw. He did not apply the views he had of other African cultures to the Nuer without first experiencing them. He explained in detail how the Nuer thought about laws, politics, and their society. The Nuer did not build courthouses or other political buildings, instead most rules and political beliefs were taught through oral histories and stories. The will and the expectation that you would follow these rules only existed a certain distance away from the village that made them.

Evans-Pritchard is known for being an early supporter for Cultural Relativism. Cultural Relativism is the belief of not judging people's cultures as better or worse compared to your own. A culture is not good or bad, it is just different. While many of Evans-Pritchard's peers considered peoples like the Azande as primitive and lesser, Evans-Pritchard found that they were rational and orderly. He also did not believe that White Europeans were inherently better than other races and this belief can be seen in his writings.

Evans-Pritchard is regarded as an important British Anthropologist and Ethnographer. He believed in the importance of fieldwork and unlike many past anthropologists, spent his time visiting and writing about the Azande and Nuer personally rather than only relying on others and writing from home. He lived among those he studied, which allowed him to gather a very excellent description of who he was living with. He was supportive of future students looking at his work and asking questions, so he tried to publish as much of his own work as he could.

Later writers would note some flaws. Evans-Pritchard contradicted himself and has faced criticism over his translation skills. Also, some of his writings about parts of the cultures he studied, such as with the Nuer religion, have flaws. Modern critics note that most of his work was done while the people he studied were ruled under the British Empire. Which to the critics, implies his work has a possible moral problem.

Even though he was criticized, he is thought to have been an excellent writer. Also, he is said to have been a very good ethnographer, an individual who records aspects of a culture. He is remembered as an important anthropologist.

Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard retired in 1970 and was knighted in 1971, a great honor in his native Great Britain. He died in Oxford, England in 1973.

Jamie Vardy

Jamie Richard Vardy (born 11 January 1987) is an English professional footballer who plays for Leicester City as a striker. He is one of the most successful strikers in Premier League.

Vardy won the Premier League title with Leicester in 2016.
He has played for the England national team, but has retired from international play to protect his body from wear and tear. His club contract is by far his main source of income.

Vardy is very unusual, because he was a third division player who made it big when transferred to a Premier League club quite late in his career.

He started his footballing career at the age of sixteen, playing for Stockbridge Park Steels youth system. On his debut for Halifax Town in 2010, Vardy scored the winning goal against Buxton. He was their top scorer for the season, with 25 goals in 37 appearances. After leaving Halifax for Fleetwood Town, he became the season's top scorer with 31 league goals.

In May 2012, Vardy signed for Championship side Leicester City. In 2013-14 season, Vardy got the Leicester's player of the season award, with 16 league goals. The following season, Leicester was promoted to the Premier League. Vardy won his first Premier League Player of the Month award for the month of October in 2015 and won it again in November.

The sports' highlight of the year was when Leicester won the 2015-16 season of the Premier League, one season after promotion. Vardy won the Premier League Player of the Season award and was one of the four Leicester players selected in the PFA Team of the Year. He scored his first UEFA Champions League goal on 22 February 2017. He is the only player in Premier league history to have scored goals in 11 consecutive (one after the other) matches. On 5 July, 2020, Vardy scored 2 goals against Crystal Palace to complete a century of goals in Premier League.

Vardy was selected for the England squad for UEFA Euro 2016. He made his international debut for England on 7th June, coming as a substitute for Wayne Rooney against the Republic of Ireland. He scored his first goal for England against Germany on 26 March 2016. He was also selected in England's squad for the World Cup 2018.

On 28 August 2018, Vardy "stepped aside" from the England national team. He told manager Gareth Southgate that he did not want to be considered for selection unless there was an injury crisis.

AutoHotkey

AutoHotkey is a free, open-source scripting language for Microsoft Windows. It allows users to create keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys, fast macro-creation and software automation. It allows users to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows application. User interfaces can be extended or modified by AutoHotkey. For example, replacing the Windows control key commands with their Emacs equivalents. The AutoHotkey installation includes a help file. Documentation is available on the internet.

AutoHotkey scripts can be used to load programs, open documents, and issue keystrokes and mouse clicks.

AutoHotkey scripts can also change variables and manipulate windows, files, and folders.

AutoHotkey scripts can be started by a hotkey. When the user presses a combination of keys, such as on the keyboard, a script could open a web browser.

Keyboard keys can be remapped, such that pressing might result in the active window receiving an en dash (–). The same keys could be disabled, such that pressing might result in nothing happening at all.

AutoHotkey also allows for 'hotstrings' that will automatically replace certain text as it is typed. A typical use for hotstrings is expanding abbreviations. Typing "btw" could be made to produce the text "by the way".

Scripts can be started automatically when the computer starts. These could run in the background and could be used to write information to a logfile.

More complex tasks can be making custom data entry forms (GUI windows), working with the system registry, or using the Windows API by calling functions from DLLs. The scripts can be compiled into an executable file that can be run on other computers that do not have AutoHotkey installed.

The source code is in C++ and can be compiled with Visual Studio Express.

Memory access through pointers is allowed just as in C.

Some uses for AutoHotkey:

The first public beta of AutoHotkey was released on November 10, 2003. It was based on the syntax on AutoIt v2. It used some AutoIt v3 commands and the AutoIt v3 compiler. AutoIt v3 changed its license from GPL to closed source because of "other projects repeatedly taking AutoIt code" and "setting themselves up as competitors."

In 2010, AutoHotkey v1.1 (originally called AutoHotkey_L) became the platform for ongoing development of AutoHotkey. In late 2012, it became the official branch.

The following script will allow a user to search for a particular word or phrase using Google. After copying text from any application to the clipboard, pressing the configurable hotkey will open the user's default web browser and perform the search.

The following script defines a hotstring that enables the user to type "afaik" in any program and have it automatically replaced with "as far as I know":

The example below makes replace selected text in an editor with a quoted version of that text. It illustrates the use of functions, arguments and default argument values.

Some malware has been written using AutoHotkey.

Anti-malware products sometimes falsely identify AutoHotkey scripts as malware. These are called "false positives".



Samoa Observer

The Samoa Observer is the biggest newspaper group in Samoa. It is written in English and Samoan. The paper that is sold on Monday to Friday is called the Samoa Observer, the paper sold on Saturdays is the Weekend Observer, and the one on Sundays is the Sunday Samoan. 

The "Samoa Observer" has articles on news in Samoa, news in other countries, opinion essays, sports, and investigations by reporters. The Samoa Observer was founded in 1978 by Editor in Chief Savea Sano Malifa, a poet and Pacific news writer who received the Commonwealth Astor Award for press freedom in 1998.

The "Samoa Observer" has gotten awards for investigative journalism. Some government officials and business leaders have sued the "Samoa Observer" in court for the stories it wrote about crime or other bad acts. 

The paper's offices are located in Apia, the capital city of Samoa. In 1994, the offices were damaged in a fire after it printed stories about government corruption. 

Fetoscopy

Fetoscopy is a medical procedure to examine and treat an unborn child. It is only done in specialized hospitals. Because it is difficult to do, it is only done for severe illnesses. The complication that occurs most often is that the baby is born early, or that a miscarriage occurs. This happens in up to 5% of the cases. In many cases, fetoscopy is completented or replaced by medical ultrasound.

Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque

Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque (built 1192 - 1316) Quwwat-ul-Islam was sponsored by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, founder of the Mamluk dynasty. The Quwwat-ul-Islam is best known for its tower of victory, celebrating the Islamic conquest of India. 27 Jain and Hindu temples were dismantled and their stonework salvaged into the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque. It consists of a rectangular courtyard enclosed by cloisters. Perhaps it was the first monument of iconoclast in India. It is in contradiction to Hasan Nizami's account of Aibak as peaceful and 'Lakh Baksh' or 'giver of lakhs' in his book Taj-ul-Masir. It is said he was generous and spent huge sums in charity. But it may also be that the monument was hurriedly built with the building material from the temple as Aibak had not established himself firmly in India at that time.

Quwwat-ul-Islam, the "Glory of Islam," was hastily erected by the young amir, who conscripted an army of local craftsmen, presumably Hindus, to assemble the structure thought there is no evidence to confirm the religious demography of the craftsmen 

The Qūwat-ul-Islām mosque (completed 1196), consisting of cloisters around a courtyard with the sanctuary to the west, was built from the remains of demolished temples celebrating the Muslim conquest of India. It is built of red sandstone, gray quartz, and white marble, but is probably inspired by the “Iron Pillar " that stands on the site. Built in the Gupta dynasty in the 6th century, it is the only piece of the temple that stands in its original location. Qutb built around it when he constructed the mosque. Although made of iron, it has resisted rust for over 1,500 years.

Later, a lofty arched screen was erected and the mosque was enlarged, by Shams-ud- Din Iltutmish (A.D. 1210 - 1235) and Ala-ud-Din Khalji. The Iron Pillar in the courtyard bears an inscription in Sanskrit in Brahmi script of fourth century A.D., according to which the pillar was set up as a Vishnudhvaja (standard of god Vishnu) on the hill known as Vishnupada in memory of a mighty king named Chandra. A deep socket on the top of the ornate capital indicates that probably an image of Garuda was fixed into it.

Non-volatile memory

Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a type of computer memory that can hold its data even when the computer’s power is turned off. 

Unlike volatile memory, it does not need its data to be continually refreshed. 

It is the type of memory used in ROM memory chips such as those holding a PC's bootloader program. Flash memory, often used in secondary storage, is also non-volatile.

Minh Mạng

Minh Mạng ([mïŋ˧ maːŋ˧˨ʔ]; 25 May 1791 – 20 January 1841), personal name Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, also known as Nguyễn Phúc Kiểu, was the second emperor of the Nguyễn Dynasty in Vietnamese History. His reign lasted 21 years, from 1820 until his death in 1841.

Emperor Minh Mạng was the fourth son of Emperor Gia Long; his mother was Trần Thị Đang, second wife of Gia Long (conferred Empress Dowager Nhân Tuyên later). Three eldest son of Gia Long, Crown prince Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh, "Duke of Thuận An" Nguyễn Phúc Hy and prince Nguyễn Phúc Tuấn, had died before their father, so Minh Mạng was the eldest son of Gia Long at that time.

Minh Mạng is reported to have 142 children from 43 wives. He also had many concubines whose childless, and not be reported in royal pedigree. The first wife of him was Empress Consort Tá Thiên Hồ Thị Hoa, mother of Emperor Thiệu Trị, but she died after 13 days giving birth. The second wife, "First-rank of Royal Concubine Hiền phi" Ngô Thị Chính, was the most beloved wife of Minh Mạng, but she had not been conferred as Empress Consort.

Ngô Thị Chính

Ngô Thị Chính (or Chánh) (1792 – 1843) was an imperial consort of Emperor Minh Mạng of the Nguyễn Dynasty in Vietnamese History.

Ngô Thị Chính was born in Đăng Xương, Huế, daughter of "Attorney General" Ngô Văn Sở and lady Nguyễn Thị Đích. She also had 2 younger brother named Thắng and Thọ.

Lady Chính married Minh Mạng while he was still as Crown Prince. In 1820, Minh Mạng crowned, lady Chính was granted the title "Cung tần" ("Imperial maid"), as well as other concubines of him. Because at that time, lady Hồ Thị Hoa had died after giving birth to Miên Tông (Thiệu Trị later), lady Chính was the primary wife of Minh Mạng, leader of the harem. 

Not long after that, she was granted Tam giai Hiền tần ("Third-rank of Royal Concubine Hiền tần"). The First and Second-rank was emptied, so Hiền tần still kept the highest rank in the harem. In 1836, she was elevated to Nhất giai Hiền phi ("First-rank of Royal Concubine Hiền phi").

Although more than 40, Hiền Phi still gave birth to a son, proving that she was still loved by the emperor despite her age.

In 1843, Hiền Phi died at 52 years old and was buried at Hương Thủy, Huế. Emperor Thiệu Trị granted the posthumous name for Hiền phi, was Tuệ Khiết.

Hiền phi Ngô Thị Chính gave birth to 9 children for Minh Mạng:


Larinus planus

Larinus planus is a weevil, an insect of the Curculionidae family. It is native to Europe, and is also common in North America. Both the larvae and adults feed on flower buds, mostly of thistles. They are oval shaped, dark brown or black, and about 5-10 millimeters long.

The larvae stage does the most damage to the flower bud. In North America it has been used as a biocontrol agent.

"Larinus planus" has been used in North America to control the creeping thistle, a weed from Europe. It has spread to other plants. In 2000, it was found eating "Cirsium undulatum". This is a thistle native to western Colorado and eastern Utah. Later research found that it had reduced the amount of seeds produced by the native thistle. It has also been found to have a bad effect on "Cirsium pitcheri".

It is normal for introduced species to spread rapidly because they are free of the parasites and predators of their native land.

Garfield Minus Garfield

Garfield Minus Garfield, also known as Jon Arbuckle, is a comic published on the internet and created by Dan Walsh, a technology manager from Dublin, Ireland, that received notably large attention during 2008. Each comic strip consists of a previous "Garfield" comic strip with every character except Garfield's owner Jon Arbuckle removed. Dan Walsh says he was not the first to come up with this idea, but was the first to popularize it.

Paws, Inc. publishes a similarly named and themed comic strip every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and later every Tuesday.

Because Garfield is not present, the comic strips mostly show his owner, Jon Arbuckle, interacting with himself instead of Garfield. The comic strip's website calls this "a journey deep into the mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against loneliness and depression in a quiet American suburb."

"Garfield" creator and artist Jim Davis has said he occasionally reads the comic strip, it fascinates him, and he finds it to be an "inspired thing to do". Some variations of the idea have also been created, such as a Garfield Minus Jon Tumblr blog.

On October 28 2008, Ballantine Books released a "Garfield Minus Garfield" book in full color, with the original comics alongside the edited ones. It is credited to Jim Davis, who officially allowed it to be published, with an introduction written by Dan Walsh. However, most of the content inside the book consists of a section with "Garfield Minus Garfield Strips by Dan", ending with "A word from Jim Davis" and a small section of Jim Davis' own attempts at making "Garfield Minus Garfield" comic strips.

Paws, Inc. published its own "Garfield Minus Garfield" from November 3, 2008 to July 21, 2010, and resumed publishing on April 25, 2012. Unlike Dan Walsh's version, Paws, Inc.'s version also includes the original "Garfield" comic strip underneath.


Albany adder

The Albany adder is a viper that is less than a foot long and is also a highly venomous snake, native to South Africa. It is the most rare and endangered snake in South Africa. The Albany Adder has a rare brown and red pattern on its scales. It also seems to have horns over its eyebrows. The Adder reaches sexual maturity between 3 and 4 years of age. They can live around 15 years old in the wild. 

This breed was found in the 1990s. There have only been a dozen found, one was found dead. The last was found and recorded in 2007. A group of reptile experts went looking for this hard to find snake and were only able to find two during their first day. In 2014, the Albany Adder was put on the Critically endangered species list as the most endangered reptile.This snake was a month from being extinct due to the rule of a species not being found and recorded in a ten year span. If not recorded in this time frame, it is labeled as extinct.
Due to the loss of the snake's home there have been few sightings of this snake. Scientists are keeping the location of the snake a secret in order to save it. There are now rules for their lands. The snakes reside in small plants and tiny trees. Reptile experts know nearly nothing about the what the Albany Adder eats, how they have babies, and the way they act. 

Scientists know what other Adders eat, how they have babies, and how they behave. They have reason to believe that these habits are similar to the Albany Adder.

Adders eat small Mammals. small Reptiles, nesting Birds, and Amphibians. Scientists think Albany Adders mate nearly the same way as other Adders. Females can produce around 10-12 babies who go off on their own shortly after being born.

Needle felting

Needle felting is a dry felting technique which employs one or more specially designed needles to manipulate wool fibers. This technique is used by artists and craftspeople to sculpt objects and embellish textiles with wool. Needle felting can be used to create soft sculpture, dolls, figurines, and 2 dimensional wool paintings.

Needle felting dates back to the 1980s. The technique was adapted from industrial felting by David & Eleanor Stanwood. They took needles from a wool factory and used them to create handmade felt without the use of water or soap. The skills for needle felting were passed on to Ayala Talpai who wrote books and taught others to needle felt. Today, needle felting is still not as popular as wet felting. However, it has a strong following with people who enjoy arts and crafts.

Finger gloves are small leather strips that cover the index finger and thumb in order to protect fingers from injury. Finger gloves can be useful for beginners, but contact with a hard surface can damage or break delicate felting needles.

A cushion or mat is required for needle felting. A mat is used to protect both the delicate felting needles as well as the work surface below. A felting mat can be made out of many materials, but are commonly foam, sponge, or other soft materials that can withstand repeated puncture by the needle without causing damage to it.
Felting needles are the most important tool for needle felting. They are specially designed with notches or 'barbs' all along the shaft to mat and lock wool fibers together. They come in a variety of sizes: smaller needles have finer barbs and can be used for more detailed work, while larger needles have thick barbs and can create felt faster than other needle sizes. The needle size is measured in gauges ranging from 12 to 42. It is a measurement of how many needles fit in a square inch. That means the higher the gauge, the smaller the needle.

The wool that is typically used for needle felting is called roving or batting - wool that has been cleaned and carded is packaged this way for spinning and other fiber crafts. Many different types of wool are suitable for needle felting. Sheep's wool is most common, but other animal fibers and even some plant and synthetic fibers can be needle felted.

Needle felting starts by placing a cushion or mat on a flat surface. To create a 3D object, a small amount of wool is tightly rolled up into a small bundle. The wool is then stabbed over and over again with the felting needle to lock the fibers together, eventually creating a firm texture that is called felt. Adding more wool and poking it repeatedly into the felt expands the object until it achieves the desired shape. Needle felting can also be used to create 2D wool paintings. For this process, wool is applied to an existing piece of felt or fabric. Small amounts of fiber are painstakingly poked into the fabric to create the desired image.

Flemish Giant rabbit

The Flemish Giant rabbit is one of the largest breeds of domestic rabbits, earning the name, "King of Rabbits." Originally, these rabbits were bred for their fur and meat. It's origins are quite vague. It is believed that these rabbits are descended from the Patagonia Rabbit, possibly crossed with another rabbit. Also, no one is sure as to what region these rabbits are from.

The difference in does (females) and bucks (males) can be told by looking at their head. Bucks have a broader head while does' are dainty and have a dewlap, a fold of skin under their chin, used to keep kits (baby rabbits) warm.

The Flemish Giant rabbit has other nicknames besides "King of Rabbits." The name "Gentle Giants" was earned because unlike the smaller domestic rabbit, Flemish Giants are known for being much more calm and gentle. They are also called the "Universal Rabbit" mainly for being great pets and show animals, although, it could also be because of their use as a resource for food and material.

"Giant" obviously comes from their large size. "Flemish" was the language spoken in the region where they were being bred. Their large size does mean a bit more of food and maintenance but these rabbits can be taken care of the same way the normal domestic sized rabbits would be taken care of.

Their glossy fur is short and dense. Their coats come in seven different colors; light gray, steel gray, black, fawn, sandy, white, and blue.

Mature Flemish Giants weigh 13-14 lbs on average but they can weigh up to 20 pounds, even a bit more. They can grow to be bigger than some dogs. On average, the Flemish Giant can grow to 2 1/2 in length. The longest Flemish Giant recorded is 4 ft. 3 in. The typical ear length for them is 8 inches.

Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt is a series of rock formations in Northern Canada, on the eastern shore of the Hudson Bay. They may be up to 4.4 billion years old. The belt is one of the oldest rock formations on Earth, but there is dispute about its actual age. 3,770 million years ago is accepted by others. The rocks have been metamorphosed by later geological events.

Thai street food

Thai street food is a market place in Thailand where vendors set up stalls to sell food and people buy to enjoy on the go or directly on nearby tables. This event is set up throughout the day with many different Thai cuisines and desserts such as popular dishes like "Som Tam," which is a salad made from shredded green papayas topped with tomatoes, lime, peanuts, garlic, and chili peppers and "Pad Thai" which is known as the country’s famous stir-fried noodles with any kind of meat such as pork, beef, chicken, or shrimp. They also have popular desserts such as "Khao Niao Mamuang" or mango sticky rice made with a bed of sticky rice at the bottom with a fresh mango cut into slices on top and finished off with a drizzle of sweet coconut milk; these foods are usually served as a small portion, just enough for one at a very low price.

There are many Thai cuisines displayed from noodles to curries, soups to salad, and many sweet desserts. One popular noodle soup, "Guay Teow," is made from rice noodles or egg noodles with beef, pork, and chicken stock. Sometimes vendors add wantons, which are small dumplings or meat balls, to the broth. The Thai version of spaghetti and meatballs is called "Pad See Eiw." It's a noodle dish made from wide and thick rice noodles that is stir fried in dark soy sauce with either pork, chicken, or beef and Chinese broccoli or cabbage. It's a great substitute from pad thai because it's not spicy, although some ask for dried chili flakes on the side. Those who enjoy food can also add vinegar to liven the dish. Another unique street food dish is "Massaman Gai," which is a curry that comes from Persia. This dish is flavored with Cinnamon, Tamarind sauce, and sugar, topped with roasted peanuts and bay leaves, it's made with coconut milk, potatoes, and chicken or tofu for vegetarians.

Thai street also has desserts. These can be wrapped or serve in other unique ways. “Khao Lam” which is Bamboo sticky rice, is served inside a bamboo stick roasted in charcoal. The inside can have white sticky rice or black sticky rice filled with black beans or sesame. The bamboo gives this dessert a unique taste. Diners crack open the top and then pull down each bamboo strip like a flower until the sticky rice is reached. This dessert's price range is from 14 cents (US) to as much as $2. Thai desserts also include ice cream. Being one of the hottest places in the world, there are a lot of stalls that sell many ice cream desserts like “Itim Kati” or coconut ice cream. This dessert is made out of coconut milk with a soft texture, a blend between creamy and icy. It's served in a coconut shell and is as cheap as 57 to 86 cents (US). There is also a unique dessert that can be found in Thai street markets called “Bua Loy Nam King” or Black sesame dumplings in ginger soup. This street dessert is originally from China. It is filled with warm spicy Ginger soup with rice flour dumplings that have black sesame paste on the inside, it’s texture is soft and chewy.

Constrained comics

Constrained comics are comics on which restrictions are intentionally placed.

A similar idea is constrained writing, a style of writing that also features restrictions that are intentionally placed. Using that idea, writers have attempted to do things such as write novels that are palindromes or do not feature the letter "e". Some of these ideas are sorted into their own genres of poetry, such as haiku or sonnet.

Some notable examples of constrained comics are listed here:

The Angriest Dog in the World

The Angriest Dog in the World is a comic strip created by film director David Lynch.

Lynch came up with the idea for the comic strip in 1973 during a time when he was feeling very angry. The comic strip was first published in the "LA Reader", and ran from 1983 until 1992. The comic strip was also serialized in "Cheval Noir".

Each comic strip is introduced with a small caption featuring this text:
Each strip is visually the same. The first three panels are identical, and feature the black dog growling, tied to a post in a yard by a chain. He is between a tree on the left and one wall of a house with a window on the right. The fourth panel is the same as the previous three panels, except it is night time and a circle of light is coming from the house's window.

A word balloon appears in one or more of the panels, showing one of the members of one of the house's unseen family, either Bill, Sylvia, Pete or Billy, Jr, is speaking. The speech is usually an aphorism or a non-sequitur. Such sayings include: "If everything is real... then nothing is real as well." and "It doesn't get any better than this."

In a short essay on Lynch's "Rabbits", Objectif Cinema notes:
David Lynch has of course used animals within his back catalogue of work before. Dogs for instance feature in nearly every one of his movies usually as a visual prop: who could forget the scene in "Wild at Heart" in which our canine friend scampers away with the Bank teller's severed hand? Or the mewling pups in Mary X's living room in "Eraserhead"? Indeed a dog, albeit in cartoon form, took centre stage in Lynch's cartoon series for the "LA Reader", "The Angriest Dog in the World". But it is here on his website that Lynch seems to be opening up more to the wonders of nature: Bees, Coyotes and Dead Mice all have a part to play in various guises and manifestations within www.davidlynch.com, and as part of the pay-per-view series, the Rabbit has been given the starring role.

2019 Hyderabad gang rape

The 2019 Hyderabad gang rape was the murder of a 26 year old veterinary doctor. It had an effect across all of India.

Her body was found in Shadnagar on 28 November 2019, a day after her death. Four suspects were arrested and, according to the Cyberabad Metropolitan Police, confessed to having raped and killed the doctor. On 6 December, the police took the accused to the scene of the crime, and shot them dead, prompting accusations of extrajudicial execution and celebrations of the killings. 

The following account is based on the police report. The victim had parked her scooter near a toll plaza, and caught the attention of two lorry drivers and their assistants. They deflated her tire, pretended to help her, and pushed her into nearby bushes, where they raped and smothered her. Then they loaded her corpse onto a lorry and dropped it on the roadside.

The police got evidence from CCTV cameras and from the victim's mobile phone. The accused were arrested and were put in Cherlapally Central Jail for fourteen days. The Telangana Chief Minister ordered a fast-track court to try the accused for their alleged crimes. 

The rape and murder caused outrage in several parts of the country. Protests and public demonstrations against rape were organised nationwide after the incident, with the public demanding stricter laws against rape and rapists. The Minister of Home Affairs criticised the Telangana Police and stated that the government intended to amend the Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure to introduce laws for quicker punishment by fast-track courts.

All four accused were killed by police on 6 December 2019, under a bridge on Bangalore Hyderabad national highway, while they were in police custody. According to the police, the suspects were taken there for a reconstruction of the crime scene. Two of them allegedly snatched guns and attacked the police. In the ensuing shootout, all four suspects were shot dead. 

Thousands of people celebrated the men's deaths. The event has no religious angle : the accused included men of both main religions.

PartiallyClips

PartiallyClips is a comic published on the internet that was created by Rob Balder and ran from 2002 to 2015. At the start of 2010, Balder gave authorship of the comic to Tim Crist, the comedy musician behind Worm Quartet.

"PartiallyClips" is a constrained comic. Each three-panel strip consists of the same clip art image (the comic has no original art) in each panel for the whole strip, with added speech balloons and/or captions to create the joke.

"PartiallyClips" frequently tends to use dark humor because the picture used shows peace, which is common in public-domain clip art, but the added dialogue or captions make it instead not show peace. "PartiallyClips" also frequently comments on modern life and culture, especially aspects of Internet culture. No characters or plots often repeat.

Its name is a derivation from a misinterpreted phrase that results from a mishearing of the name because "Partially Clips" sounds similar to "Partial eclipse".

"PartiallyClips" was updated twice every week, on Sundays and Thursdays. The "partiallyclips.com" website stopped updating on 17 June 2015. During 2018, the PartiallyClips website went down, and remains unavailable as of August 2019. The archives were available on the Erfworld domain, but are not available there anymore because that domain has largely been taken down due to personal tragedy.

In addition to being published online, the strip was also self-licensed to print media, being targeted at alternative weekly newspapers. It appeared in about 25 newspapers and magazines, and was published in a book called "Suffering For My Clip Art: The Best Of Partially Clips Volume 1". Material from "PartiallyClips" was included in "".

PartiallyClips was included in a short list of comics published on the internet that was included in an NPR article released in 2009. The article's author, Glen Weldon, called it "a combination of found art, a finely honed comic sensibility, and awesomeness run rampant."

FrogPhone

The FrogPhone is a machine that uses microphones to listen to frogs so scientists can study them and the places they live. It also has thermometers to measure how hot or cold it is in the air and water.
Scientists plan to place the FrogPhone machine in a swamp or other place where frogs live and then leave. The FrogPhone works off of two lithium batteries that are recharged by a solar panel. This way, the humans do not have to come back to change the batteries, so they do not disturb the plants or animals.

Scientists can use their cellular phones to call the FrogPhone and either listen to what is happening where the FrogPhone is at that time or make a recording to listen to later or to send to a database for other people. FrogPhone only works in places that have 3G/4G cell phone coverage, but scientists think it could be used with satellites in the future.

Australian scientists invented the FrogPhone in 2019. The team had members from the University of New South Wales at Canberra and the University of Canberra and they worked with the Australian Capital Territory, Region Frogwatch Program, and Australian National University. As of December 2019, FrogPhone has been tested but not used in the real world.

It was released in the rest of the United States in May 2000. It was designed to appeal to teenagers by being able to send text messages two ways using radio. Over 430 "official" freeware games and applications were released for the Cybiko. Because it could be used to send text messages, it had a QWERTY keyboard used with a stylus. An MP3 player add-on and a SmartMedia card reader were made for the Cybiko. The company stopped manufacturing the Cybiko after two product versions. Multiple Cybikos can communicate with each other from up to 300 metres (0.19 miles) away. Several Cybikos can be used for chatting with each other in a wireless chatroom. Over 500,000 Cybiko Classics were sold by the end of 2000.

There are two models of the Cybiko Classic. The only difference that can be seen between the two models is the original version has a power switch on the side, and the later version uses the "escape" key for power management. Internally, the differences between the two models are in the internal memory, and where the firmware is.

The CPU is a Hitachi H8S/2241 running at 11.0592 MHz. The Cybiko Classic also has an Atmel AT90S2313 co-processor running at 4 MHz so it can support RF communications. It comes with 512KB of ROM flash storage and 256KB of RAM. It comes with an add-on slot in the back.

The Cybiko Classic came in five colors: blue, purple, neon green, white, and black. The black version has a yellow keypad, instead of the white unit the other Cybikos have.

The add-on slot has the same pin arrangement as a PC card, but it is not electrically compatible.

It has various improvements over the original Cybiko, such as a faster processor, more RAM, more ROM, a new operating system, a new keyboard layout, a new case design, a bigger wireless range, a microphone, improved audio output and a smaller size.

The CPU is a Hitachi H8S/2323 running at 18 MHz. Just as with the original version, it also has an Atmel AT90S2313 co-processor running at 4 MHz so it can support RF communications. The Cybiko Extreme comes with 512KB ROM flash storage and 1.5MB RAM. It comes with an add-on slot in the back, but the only hardware released that can be connected to it is an MP3 player.

Two variants of the Cybiko Xtreme were released. The US variant (Model No. CY44801), which had a frequency range of 902-928 MHz, and the European variant (Model No. CY44802), which had a frequency range of 868-870 MHz. There were no other functional differences between those variants.


It is a add-on card that gave the Cybiko 1 megabyte of static RAM and 1 megabyte of flash storage. The RAM allowed Cybiko programs that need more RAM to run. The flash storage allows more Cybiko programs to be stored. Some Cybiko programs would not run if the 1MB Expansion Memory is not connected to the add-on slot.

Sanna Marin

Sanna Mirella Marin (born 16 November 1985) is a Finnish former politician. Marin was the Prime Minister of Finland from 2019 to 2023. She is a member of the Social Democrats. She was a member of the Parliament of Finland from 2015 to 2023. She was the Minister of Transport and Communications for a short time in 2019.

After Antti Rinne left his position as prime minister, the Social Democratic Party of Finland selected Marin as its candidate for the new prime minister on 8 December 2019. Taking office at age 34, she is the youngest person to hold the office in Finnish history.

As prime minister, Marin was in charge of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. She called out the human rights abuses of Uyghurs in Xinjiang and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. With President Sauli Niinistö, she announced that Finland would apply for NATO membership in May 2022. She was also criticized, mainly because of a October 2020 photoshoot and leaked private party videos. In 2022, she was called by an "the icon of progressive leadership" by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The SDP finished third in the 2023 parliamentary election, ending Marin's time as prime minister in June 2023. Three months later, she retired from politics.

Sanna Mirella Marin was born on 16 November 1985 in Helsinki. Her parents split up when she was very young. The family faced financial problems and Marin's father, Lauri Marin, was an alcoholic. After her biological parents separated, Marin was brought up by her mother and her mother's female partner.

Marin graduated from the Pirkkala High School in 2004 at the age of 19. She joined the Social Democratic Youth in 2006 and was its first vice president from 2010 to 2012. She worked in a bakery and as a cashier while studying. She graduated with a bachelor's and master's degree in Administrative Science from the University of Tampere.

Marin's political career began when she was aged 20. She unsuccessfully ran for election to the City Council of Tampere, but was elected in the 2012 elections. She became chairperson of the City Council within months, from 2013 to 2017. In 2017, she was re-elected to the City Council.

Marin was elected second deputy chairperson of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 2014. In 2015, she was elected to the Finnish Parliament as an MP from the electoral district of Pirkanmaa. Four years later, she was re-elected. On 6 June 2019, she became the Minister of Transport and Communications.

On 23 August 2020, Marin was elected chair of the SDP, replacing Antti Rinne.

In December 2019, Marin was nominated by the Social Democratic Party to replace Antti Rinne as the Prime Minister of Finland, but Rinne stayed as party leader until June 2020. By a small amount of votes, Marin beat Antti Lindtman to become prime minister. A majority of the ministers in her cabinet are women, 12 out of 19 at the time of the cabinet's creation. She is the third female head of government in Finland, after Anneli Jäätteenmäki and Mari Kiviniemi.

When she was confirmed by Parliament at the age of 34, she became Finland's youngest-ever prime minister, and was the youngest state leader until Sebastian Kurz became Chancellor of Austria again in January 2020.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Marin's cabinet declared a state of emergency in Finland to stop the epidemic in the country. When Swedish prime minister Stefan Löfven could not attend a European Council meeting in October 2020, Marin also represented Sweden in the meeting. Marin later asked Löfven to represent Finland at a Council meeting later that month.

In October 2020, Marin took part in a photo shoot for the Finnish magazine "" in which she wore a blazer with nothing underneath, causing controversy while her supporters called the critics sexist.

In May 2021, Finnish media reported that Marin and her family were paying about €300 per month for groceries with public funds as a part of the Prime Minister's tax-free housing benefits. This was legally questioned if a prime minister was able to do this. Marin had used around 14.000 euro for her own food, which was over the limit of 2500 euro. Marin claimed that she did not know the limit.

In early December 2021, Marin went celebrating in a nightclub in Helsinki hours after being in close contact with Finland's foreign minister who had tested positive for COVID-19, making her exposed to the disease. Two text messages were sent to Marin's government phone saying that she should be quarantined. However, Marin missed the messages because she was not carrying the phone at the time. According to the government instructions, the Prime Minister should always have the governmental phone. She apologized on Facebook and said that she had been told that going out in public was allowed because she was vaccinated. Two complaints about Marin's actions were sent to the Chancellor of Justice. Important members of the coalition party Centre Party said that Marin had lied to them by chaning her reasoning of going out.

In early 2022, Marin announced her support of Finland joining NATO, causing a negative reaction from Russia. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Marin strongly wanted Finland to join NATO and called on several NATO countries to support their membership. On 25 February, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson threatened Finland and Sweden with "military and political consequences" if they tried to join NATO. 

On 12 May 2022, ten weeks after the beginning of the invasion, President Sauli Niinistö and Marin both said that "Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay" and that a NATO membership would be good for the country's security. On 15 May, Niinistö and Marin announced that Finland would apply for NATO membership, and on 17 May the Finnish parliament approved the proposal 188-8. She said her country did not want permanent NATO bases or nuclear weapons on its territory. On 31 May, she supported a deal agreed by all European Union leaders to ban more than 90% of Russian oil by the end of the year.

In August 2022, another video showed Marin dancing at another party, which caused controversy because people thought Marin was on drugs while dancing at the party. Marin took a drug test on her own to prove she was not on drugs and on 22 August, the results of the test came out negative for drugs in her system.

In October 2022, Marin apologised to the indigenous Sámi people for the problems in the reform of the Sámi human rights legislation. The legislation has been proposed for three parliamentary terms without any progress. In November, ministers voted 11–3 to send the legislation to the Finnish Parliament. On 24 February 2023, the constitutional law committee voted 9–7 to suspend work on the bill, preventing the legislation from being passed.

In March 2023, the SDP finished third in the 2023 parliamentary election, and soon acknowledged her defeat.

On 7 September 2023, Marin announced her plans to resign as an MP to work as a strategic advisor at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. On 12 September 2023 she formally resigned from the Finnish Parliament.

On 28 September 2023, it was reported that she had signed with talent agency Range Media Partners.

In January 2024, Marin started working in a new committee called "International Task Force on Security and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine". According to a statement released by the Ukrainian president's office, the committee's primary role is to create a plan for Ukraine's closer engagement with the Euro-Atlantic security area.

In January 2018, Marin and her fiancé, football player Markus Räikkönen, had a daughter, Emma. In August 2020, Marin and Räikkönen were married at the prime minister's official residence, Kesäranta. The couple divorced in May 2023, after 19 years together.

Marin said she came from a "rainbow family", as she was raised by same-sex parents. She was the first person in her family to go to a university.

Marin is a vegetarian.

Marin was on the list of the BBC's "100 Women" in 2020. That same year, she was chosen by "Forbes" on the list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women. In 2020 she became a "Young Global Leader" of the World Economic Forum. In December 2022, The Australian Broadcasting Corporation named Marin as the icon of progressive leadership.

Bhupathy's purple frog

Bhupathy's purple frog ("Nasikabatrachus bhupathi") is a frog species belonging to the family Sooglossidae. It lives in the Western Ghat mountains in India. It is a purple cave frog that lives underground almost all the time.

Many species of frog dig underground a little, but Bhupathy's purple frogs live undergound almost all the time. They have front limbs shaped like shovels for digging and long noses so they can stick their tongues aboveground and lick the surface to catch ants to eat. They do not have shoot-and-pull-back tongues like other frogs. 

Adult frogs have purple skins and a thin blue ring around each eye.

The frog has one close relative, the purple frog, "N. sahyadrensis", which was first found in the Western Ghats in 2003.

The tadpoles do not swim in ponds or streams. Instead, they grab the stones behind waterfalls, where they spend six months eating algae. Young frogs, called imagos, have brown skin. They turn purple when they are adults.

Adult frogs only come aboveground when the rain falls at the beginning of the northeast monsoon season, when they find mates. 

Scientists from Hyderabad's Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology discovered the frog in 2017. They named the frog after scientist Dr. Subramaniam Bhupathy, who died in the Western Ghat Mountains in 2014. They wrote about "N. bhupathi" in "Alytes", the official magazine of the International Society for the Study and Conservation of Amphibians. They found "N. bhupathi" by listening for frog sounds coming up from underground.

"This frog lineage is very ancient, and has a very low diversity, so this finding is very special and unusual," said Elizabeth Prendini of the American Museum of Natural History, who helped write the scientific paper about the discovery.

The scientists did not to say exactly where they found the sample frogs because it was on private property.

This discovery was paid for by the Indian government in a project to sample the DNA of every frog in the country. 

Some scientists said that because "N. bhupathy", which lives in India, has close relatives in the Seychelles, which are close to Africa, it is likely that the Gondwanaland idea of why the continents are where they are is right. This idea says that Africa and India used to be one large continent, called Gondwanaland.

Horsetooth Reservoir

Horsetooth Reservoir is a man-made lake just west of Fort Collins, Colorado, in southern Larimer County made for recreation purposes, and is the main water supply for the Poudre Valley. The reservoir was a part of the Colorado-Big Thompson project. This project was made to move water from the west slope to the east slope. The water is used for local farms, hydropower, and drinking water for Northern Colorado. The lake is 6.5 miles long and had 25 miles of shore line with 4 camping areas, 111 campsites total, and 4 boat-launch areas. The primary activities are fishing, power boating, water skiing, hiking, and camping.
This reservoir was created on top of the town of Stout. Stout was a small town with a population of 47 1/2. This town had a sandstone mine, and had a railroad that went through it. This town turned into a gost town and horsetooth reservoir was build on top of it. To this day when the water is low enough visitors can still see the buildings where Stout used to be. Horsetooth reservoirs damn began being built in 1949. In 1954, the water was used for farms until the 1970 and then only 80 percent of the water was used for farms. In the 1990's just a little over half of the water supply was used for farms and the other half was used for drinking and hydropower. This reservoir was the largest created during the Colorado-Big Thompson project. Building was finished in 1949 and water first entered the reservoir in 1951. Horsetooth was given its name because of an Arapaho legand that on the west side of the reservoir at the top of a mountain. There is a rock that Natives thought looked like a giant's heart and then later decided that it looked more like a horse's tooth.

These dogs typically are medium-sized with a short coat varying with patterns and eyes that differ in color. Catahoulas were bred through the Blood hound, Spanish mastiff and Greyhound. The Breed is known to the American Kennel Club (AKC). AKC has grouped the breed as a stock service animal.

Catahoula is a high energy-level breed that requires a lot of activities such as fetching, walking, running or hiking. Catahoula's need a lot of attention with other dogs and humans.

The Catahoula is recognized by many kennel clubs, which allows the dog to be in dog shows. The two most popular kennel clubs is AKC and UKC. If one wishes to show their Catahoula leopard dog, she must be permanently registered and have a licensing number through the kennel club chosen. Not only should the breed be licensed, they are required to be well-kept, and not be a mixed breed.

The head of the Catahoula should look strong, the mouth should look nicely even with the head and not deformed. The Leopard dog's head and mouth should be parallel, which sometimes causes wrinkles on the forehead.

In-order to be show ready, the dog must have full white teeth with nice pink gums. A sharp bite is ideal but teeth that may be worn or broken is okay.

Eyes should look medium sized, sort of rounded with varying eye colors or mix of colors. Eyes that may be deformed such as being un-centered; sagging of the eyelids; wired movability of eyelids or eyelashes can be a disqualification.

Ears flop to the side with a short to medium triangular shape. The top of the ear should be even to the head. When alert, the tip of the ear lays close to the cheek. No Catahoula for show can have cropped ears. 

The body should look strong with a broad chest. Catahoula's front legs and back legs should be medium length. When feet are being looked at, the dogs paws should be well groomed and have good webbing between toes.

Jim Cronin (zookeeper)

James Michael Cronin MBE (15 November 1951 – 17 March 2007) was an American zookeeper. He was the co-founder of Monkey World, a place of refuge for primates that have been treated badly and not taken care of properly, in Dorset, England, in 1987, from the United States. He was widely acknowledged as an international expert in the rescue and rehabilitation of abused primates, and in the enforcement of international treaties aimed at protecting them from illegal trade and experimentation.

Cronin got an honorary MBE from Queen Elizabeth II in 2006 for services to animal welfare.

Cronin was born on 15 November 1951 in Yonkers, New York, to Italian-Irish parents. He was the son of a union official. He was educated at St Denis School and Lincoln High School. He had a number of jobs after leaving school before becoming a keeper at Bronx Zoo in the 1970s. While he was working there, he realised he wanted to work with animals. He moved to Kent in the UK to work in John Aspinall's zoo in 1980.

Cronin started working with primates by working as a zoo keeper in various zoos. He came to the UK, where he got a job as a zoo keeper at John Aspinall's zoo at Howletts, where he perfected his skills of primate rehabilitation and care, in 1980. John Aspinall had set up a breeding programme for gorillas which were an endangered species. Jim Cronin's passion for working with primates made him quite successful in his career and encouraged him to wish to eventually build a safe haven for primates that were treated badly. During his years working at John Aspinall's Zoo, he gave himself the necessary experience of dealing with apes on a daily basis in his career path of working with them as well as small monkeys and their complex life needs.

The biggest rescue the centre undertook was that of the 19 retired stump-tailed macaques from a medical research laboratory in the UK; but the rescue mission in 2008, of the 88 capuchin monkeys from a medical research laboratory in Chile, took the record of the largest rescue of primates in the world.

In 2006, Cronin was awarded an MBE by Queen Elizabeth II for services to animal welfare he was accompanied by Robert Pitts. Cronin has also received the Jane Goodall Award.

The television series "Monkey Business" (made by Meridian Broadcasting and shown on ITV Meridian in the UK and on Animal Planet worldwide) has documented the Cronin's frequent rescue missions and undercover investigations throughout Europe and Asia for the past 10 years. Beginning in 2007, "Monkey Business" was replaced with "Monkey Life", which also documents the goings-on within Monkey World.
Following a brief battle with liver cancer, Cronin died on 17 March 2007 at the Cabrini Medical Center, Manhattan, New York. He was survived by his daughter Eleanor, from his first marriage, and his wife Alison Cronin. Since his death, Monkey World has been run by Alison and his close friend Jeremy Keeling.

The Jim Cronin Memorial Fund for Primate Welfare and Conservation was set up for the purpose of continuing Cronin's legacy and for the support of primate conservation and welfare all over the world. It is a UK-registered charity, number 1126939, and is sponsored by Monkey World.

The Caine Mutiny

The Caine Mutiny is a 1951 Pulitzer Prize winning war novel by American Jewish author Herman Wouk. 

In 1953, Herman Wouk wrote a play called "The Caine Mutiny Court Martial" based on the trial from the book and in which Henry Fonda played Greenwald. In 1954, there was a movie based on the book, in which Humphrey Bogart played Queeg.

Willis Seward Keith has graduated Princeton University studying literature. Willie’s mother wants him to continue his studies and get a masters degree. Willie plays piano and wants to go into show business. As a result, Willie meets and starts dating a singer whose stage name is May Wynn. Then the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor and Willie is afraid he’ll have to be sent to the army. So that that doesn’t happen, Willie joins the Navy. Willie is assigned to a ship called the USS Caine. He hates the captain for being too laidback and easygoing and sarcastic and not caring about how things look. The captain is then replaced by a new captain named Queeg. Queeg is mean, gets very angry is almost paranoid and always wants everything to be done his way. Queeg makes everyone on the Caine miserable. Tom Keefer, who is trying to write a novel about how horrible the navy is can’t get any work on his book done so he tries to convince Steve Maryk, who is Queeg’s second in command, that Queeg is insane and cannot command a ship in a time of war. Maryk doesn’t want to believe Keefer but then the ship ends up in the middle of a typhoon. Since there is no written rule about how to get out of a typhoon, Queeg tries to get out by following the rule to avoid getting into a typhoon. Since it doesn’t seem to be working Maryk decides Queeg is insane and takes over as captain with Willie’s help. Queeg has them put on trial for mutiny as soon as they get back to the United States. A Jewish lawyer named Lieutenant Barney Greenwald agrees to defend them because no one else will. When the trial begins, Willie realizes that the reason he helped Maryk wasn’t because he thought Queeg was crazy but because he hated Queeg. He still admits to what he’s done in the trial. Keefer, on the other hand, lies to the jury and says he knew nothing about the mutiny until after it happened. Greenwald still wins the trial by getting Queeg to get angry and act like he is completely crazy. Greenwald then goes to Maryk, Keefer, and Willie and tells them that they are guilty and that if there were anyone else willing to defend them he would have been the one to prosecute them. Greenwald says Queeg was actually a hero because while Willie was at Princeton and Keefer was writing his books and Greenwald was defending the Cherokee, Queeg was risking his own life to protect the country so that Greenwald’s mother didn’t get melted down into a bar of soap by the Nazis. Greenwald calls Keefer a coward for having convinced Maryk to mutiny and then betrayed Maryk during the trial. Greenwald then throws wine at Keefer’s face and says he’ll be waiting in the lobby if Keefer wants revenge and that since they are both drunk it will be a fair fight. Maryk is fired from the Navy and Keefer becomes captain. A Japanese kamikaze crashes his plane into the ship, so Keefer jumps and abandons the crew to save his own life. Willie stays on board and actually risks his own life to save everyone else and actually manages to do that. Willie then starts thinking about what is important and decides that he should marry May Wynn and have kids with her. When he comes back to America, she is using her real name and working for a soon to be divorced man who wants to have sex with her though they have not yet since she is not going to have sex with someone to whom she is not married. Willie then meets the man and he realizes that he reminds him of Keefer. Willie then knows that he can and will win her back.

Dip net

A dip net, or hand net, is a toll used to wade through water and catch fish.

Hooligan, king salmon, red salmon, pink salmon, silver salmon, and flounder are fish that are mostly caught while netting in Alaska. Hooligan, a Chinookan name, is also called a candlefish. This is an important species to eagles, gulls, and bear. This fish is found in the Pacific Northwest of Alaska. The best way to catch them is to dip net them. There is no bag unit limit when catching these fish. Only a valid fishing license will be needed and to be an official Alaskan resident. Hundreds and thousands of hooligan spawn every year in rivers. Salmon are usually born in freshwater, but slowly swim to the saltwater. They lay their eggs on the gravel and the eggs hatch after a month. These little fish are called fry because they look like long little fries when they swim in water. After they hatch, they swim to saltwater and live up to four to six years then they come back to the river, usually not the same river as they were spawned, but in a river that's not running fast. This is because hooligans are not strong swimmers.

King Salmon, a Chinookan salmon, is called king because of how aggressive and large it is. It is 30-40 inches long. They are found in the Southeast of Alaska in Prince William Sound in the Bristol Bay area. This species is highly fished because they are rich in omega-3 fatty acids which makes a good dinner. 

Sockeye salmon, also named a red salmon, are the most popular among the salmon species because of their bright orange flesh. They are found in the Northern Pacific Ocean and rivers. They can grow up to 33 inches long and weigh 4 to 15 pounds. They live to 3–7 years and are eaten by marine mammals and bears.

Pink Salmon, known as humpy fish are found in Southeast of Alaska in Prince William Sound. Males are easily identified by the large hump on their back while females have a slimmer appearance. This area is home to seabirds that feed on them as well as bears, wolves, otters, and bald eagles. Saltwater pinks are smaller than freshwater and have softer flesh. Regular freshwater are 20-25 inches in length. They run with other fish like kings and silvers. These are especially easy to catch because they're easier to trick with the correct angler method.

Silver salmon, deep bodied North Pacific salmon with black spots, are found in the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. They grow up to be 30 inches in length and live up to 2–4 years.
There are two types of basic dip netting: stationary and sweeping. There are two stationary techniques. Kick netting is placing a net at the bottom of the river where all of the rocks are and kicking to get fish. Nets are easily damaged this way. The other technique is body rushing, which is using a body to catch fish. When a school of fish rush in the water, swing the body from side to side. This can scare the fish and they should get caught in the net. There are three types of sweeping. Sight dipping is seeing fish in the water and trying to catch the fish. Scooping is digging between rocks blindly into bushes of weeds or large bushes. The last technique is dredging. The net rubs against the bottom of the river picking up mud, weeds and other debris that can trap fish.

Urethral sphincters

In mammals, the Urethral sphincters are two muscles that control the exit of urine from the bladder through the urethra. If either of them contracts, the urethra is sealed shut. In male mammals, one of the muscles is placed around the urethra. In female mammals, it is placed on the side of the vagina. In male mammals, the muscles are also used to transport the sperm, when an erection happens. 

Chipko movement

The Chipko movement was a group action in India with the goal of saving trees. This is mainly done through the act of hugging trees to protect them from being cut. It was also known as Chipko Andolan. Those who were part of it used nonviolent protests. The Chipko movement began in the early 1970s in Uttarakhand. It then spread to Uttar Pradesh. By the 1980s it had spread across most of India.

/The Chipko leads to a change in policies to stop the clear cutting of trees in some regions. (Clear cutting is a type of logging where all trees in an area are cut down).

Chipko movement was started by Sunderlal Bahuguna.

The name of the Chipko moment originated from the word 'embrace' as the villagers used to hug the trees/ and protect them from wood cutters from cutting them. In 1731, the king of Jodhpur in Rajasthan asked one of his ministers to arrange wood for constructing a new palace. The minister and workers went to a forest near a village, inhabited by Bishnois, to cut down trees. A Bishnoi woman Amrita Devi showed exemplary courage by hugging a tree and daring king’s men to cut her first before cutting the tree. The tree mattered much more to her than her own life. Sadly, the king’s men did not heed to her pleas, and cut down the tree along with Amrita Devi. Her three daughters and hundreds of other Bishnois followed her, and thus lost their lives saving trees. The incident inspired the several other rural women, who launched such similar movements in different parts of India. The Chipko Movement gained momentum under Sunderlal Bahuguna, an activist, who spent his whole life persuading and educating the villagers, to protest against the destruction of the forests and the Himalayan mountains by the government. The Chipko protests achieved a major victory in 1980 with a 15 years ban on tree felling in the Himalayan forests of the state by the order of Mrs. Indira Gandhi.
Now, even an Amrita Devi Award is given to those involved in wildlife protection and conservation.

Mortal Engines Quartet

The Mortal Engines Quartet is a fantasy novel series by British author, Philip Reeve.

A prequel series, Fever Crumb, set 600 years before the events of the Quartet, was published between 2009 and 2011. In March 2020 Reeve said "too much time has passed since I wrote the other books, it’s hard to go back to that world" and that he did not intend to publish further books in the series.

On November 18, 2020, upon asked whether "Mortal Engines" would be rebooted for the television screens, he responded that, while that would be nice, it seemed unlikely.


Icicle

An icicle is a spike of ice formed when water falling from an object freezes.

Various snow spikes are formed on days when the outdoor air temperature is sub freezing and heat from sunlight melts snow or ice on anything sloped. The droplets of water freeze as they loses their heat to the cold air, forming a cone-like shape of ice.

Once water starts dripping, it begins to freeze into a certain side. It will melt and freeze over and begin to create icicles. As winter gets longer and temperatures stay in the freezing and sunlight is present, water will just melt and drip alongside the icicle causing them to get longer and sharper. The reason why icicles are pointy is because the water drips in a downward motion. Icicles can range from millimeters to feet in length.

Icicles are beautiful, but they can sometimes be dangerous. Icicles have been reported fatal since the 1700s, from falling on people and causing accidents to property being damaged. Icicles can cause damage on many structures such as buildings and homes, once ice forms layers the weight of it can cause the structure to fall or break off. Icicles can also be formed on bridges over streets and highways creating a potential danger for nearby motor vehicles passing by.

Rydberg constant

In spectroscopy, the Rydberg constant is a physical constant relating to the electromagnetic spectra of an atom. Its symbol is formula_1 for heavy atoms or formula_2 for hydrogen. The constant is named after the Swedish physicist Johannes Rydberg. The constant first arose as an empirical fitting parameter in the Rydberg formula for the hydrogen spectral series. Niels Bohr later showed that its value could be calculated from more fundamental constants via his Bohr model. , formula_1 and electron spin "g"-factor are the most accurately measured physical constants.

The constant is expressed for either hydrogen as formula_2, or at the limit of infinite nuclear mass as formula_1. In either case, the constant is used to express the limiting value of the highest wavenumber (inverse wavelength) of any photon that can be emitted from an atom, or, alternatively, the wavenumber of the lowest-energy photon capable of ionizing an atom from its ground state. The hydrogen spectral series can be expressed simply in terms of the Rydberg constant for hydrogen formula_2 and the Rydberg formula.

In atomic physics, Rydberg unit of energy, symbol Ry, corresponds to the energy of the photon whose wavenumber is the Rydberg constant, i.e. the ionization energy of the hydrogen atom.

Jeopardy! Teachers Tournament

The "Jeopardy!" Teachers Tournament is an annual tournament on the American television game show "Jeopardy!" It features full-time teachers of students in kindergarten through twelfth grade. The tournament debuted during Season 27 (2010-2011) and has been played every season since (except for Season 37), always during any of the three ratings sweeps periods (November, February, or May), with the exception of being held from May 25th to June 5th 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Teachers Tournament follows the same 10-game format as the Tournament of Champions, College Championship, and Teen Tournament. The first five games are the quarterfinals, where all fifteen participants play in groups of three. The winners of the five games advance to the semifinals. The players with the four highest scores among non-winners advance as "wild card" players. The nine semifinalists compete in the next three games. Then the three semifinal winners advance to the two-day finals, in which cumulative scores from the two games are added to determine the championship (contestants' scores start at $0 in each game).

The person who wins the tournament receives a $100,000 prize. The first runner up gets $50,000; and the second runner up gets $25,000. Teachers who are eliminated during the semifinals go home with $10,000, and teachers who are eliminated during the quarterfinals go home with $5,000.

In addition to the aforementioned cash prize, the winner also earns an automatic spot in the next Tournament of Champions, although one winner (Larry Martin in 2018) died from pancreatic cancer before reaching that tournament. So far, two Teachers Tournaments winners have made it to the finals of the Tournament of Champions (Colby Burnett in 2013 and Francois Barcomb in 2019); only Burnett won the event. 2016 winner Jason Sterlacci is only other winner to advance to the semi-finals of the Tournament of Champions. Burnett was also invited back to the Battle of the Decades in 2014 where he advanced to the semifinals, and was team captain in the All-Star games in 2019, where he drafted 2017 Tournament of Champions finalist Alan Lin and November 2000 College Champion Pam Mueller as his team members. His team finished as the second runner-up in the event. 2015 winner Jennifer Giles also competed in the All-Star games, as a member of Team Buzzy Cohen. John Pearson was the alternate in the All-Star games.

 Catherine Whitten and Justin Hoffstetter in February 2012 are the first pair of contestants to marry each other. Their marriage took place in January 24, 2015. Maryanne Lewell and Michael Townes in 2013 are the second pair of contestants to marry each other. Their marriage took place in Canada in August 2017.

FrogWatch

FrogWatch is a name shared by citizen science programs that do the same thing. In a FrogWatch, people make recordings of frogs and other amphibians that live near them and send the recordings to databases for scientists and other people to hear and study.

Not all FrogWatch programs are run by the same people. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums runs FrogWatch USA, Nature Canada runs FrogWatch Canada, the India Biodiversity Portal runs the FrogWatch in India, and other organizations run FrogWatches in other countries.

In citizen science, scientists ask ordinary people to help with scientific research or other work. Citizen science is one kind of crowdsourcing.

The National Geographic Society developed the program that FrogWatch USA volunteers use to add information and that FrogWatch uses to study it. Volunteers record temperature with thermometers and listen for sounds made by specific types of frogs and toads. FrogWatch USA volunteers listen to and record frog habitats for three and a half minutes, starting one half-hour (30 minutes) after the sun goes down.

Scientists have used FrogWatch to study the way frogs and toads change the places they live, which types of frogs are becoming more numerous and which are becoming less numerous, how many different kinds of frogs live in one place, the way they react to changes in how hot or cold it is, and the way they act during different parts of the year.

The United States Geological Survey started FrogWatch USA in 1998, but the National Wildlife Federation took over in 2002.

Between 1998 and 2005, 1,395 people working with FrogWatch USA visited 1,942 places where frogs live and gave information to FrogWatch. They found 79 different kinds of frogs and toads. This does not count visits, places, or species for FrogWatch Canada or FrogWatches in other countries. In 2006, the National Wildlife Federation looked at FrogWatch USA for the U.S. Geological Survey. It said that FrogWatch was so good for science that the USGS should keep giving it enough money to work. It also said that FrogWatch helped teach people and it made scientific work cost less money.

FrogWatch NT works in northern Australia. It started in 1991 after cane toads came to Australia and caused problems there.

Amiga (record label)

Amiga is a popular music record label in Germany. It used to be a record label of the East German state-owned music publisher VEB Deutsche Schallplatten before becoming a record label of the Bertelsmann Music Group in 1994.

In 1947, actor and singer Ernst Busch became allowed by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany to create a music publishing house, which was named Lied der Zeit GmbH ("Song of the Times"). This publishing company included the label Amiga. In the 1950s, Lied der Zeit became VEB Deutsche Schallplatten ("German Records"), a state-owned company that had a monopoly on making records. VEB Deutsche Schallplatten had multiple record labels, each for different genres; Amiga releases included folk, jazz, pop, rock, Schlager music, chanson, and children's music.

After East Germany and West Germany became one country, most of the public state enterprises that were from East Germany were taken into pieces or sold to private investors. The Amiga label and catalog were obtained by Bertelsmann Music Group in 1994, which then became part of Sony Music Entertainment in 2008.

Amiga's catalog has 2,200 albums and about 5,000 singles, or a total of 30,000 titles.

Grail (web browser)

Grail is a free web browser. It was written in the Python programming language. It was made available for multiple platforms. It is open-source, allowing it to be changed to improve it. Grail started to be made in August 1995. It first came out in November 1995. The last version of Grail was version 0.6, which came out on 1 April 1999.

Unlike all web browsers of the time, it can run client-side Python code, mostly like how mainstream web browsers can run client-side JavaScript code.

It is thought Grail has that name because Guido van Rossum liked Monty Python and the Holy Grail, a film by Monty Python, a British comedy group. It is known Python was named after Monty Python.

Car design

Car design is the process of determining how cars and other motor vehicles like trucks look and feel. Most cars are designed by a large group of people that usually includes artists and engineers.

Typically, cars are designed based on many sketches and drawings, along with computer-aided design models. When the design team is satisfied with the basic shape of the car, a life-size model is sculpted from clay. Details are added to the clay model, and its shape may be changed by a small amount.

Then, the interior design team designs the car's interior, making sure that it fits the needs of the customer. These needs include things like comfort and entertainment systems. High-end cars like luxury cars and supercars have fancy interiors and are designed for an enjoyable driving experience, while utility vehicles like vans have plain, rugged interiors designed to endure various types of cargo.

Other parts of the car, such as the chassis and engine, are designed primarily by engineers, as it is less important for these parts to look attractive than it is for them to work properly.

While most early cars were designed around usability rather than looks, that began to change when American businessman Alfred P. Sloan came up with the idea of changing a car's styling every year. This was done from the 1920s onward to keep cars looking "new" for each year they were sold, leaving customers unhappy with older models of the same car and increasing car sales in the United States. Sloan got this idea from bicycle companies.

After World War I, car companies in European countries focused on luxury, and companies called coachbuilders made bodies for luxury cars. Some of these bodies were customized for especially rich customers.

After World War II, the American economy grew and most American citizens were now able to afford cars. Because cars became more important in the United States, so did their styling, with the most famous American car designer being Harley Earl. The influence of car design would also grow massively in Europe, especially within France, Italy, and Germany.

Obazoa

Obazoa is a clade (a group of plants or animals that share an ancestor). It is a Unikont. Unikonts are one of the five superkingdoms in the classification of eukaryotes.

The Obazoa is made up of Breviatea, Apusomonadida and Opisthokonta. It does not include Amoebozoa, because that is a different clade. The connections between opisthokonts, breviates and apusomonads are not well known yet. Probably the Breviatea are the most basic of the three groups. RNA phylogenies (evolution clues) do not give much evidence that Obazoa is a clade. This could still mean Obazoa is from a very old ancestor, and there are not many clues left (because of its age).

Holozoa

Holozoa is a group of living things that includes animals, and some single-celled relatives of animals. It excludes fungi. "Holozoa" is also an old name for the tunicate genus "Distaplia". 

Holozoa is a clade: a group of plants or animals with a common ancestor. It has all organisms close to animals."

An example of a well-known holozoan is the choanoflagellate, which looks a lot like the cells of a sponge. "Proterospongia" is an example of a choanoflagellate that might give clues as to how sponges evolved.

The phylogenic tree (evolution tree) below shows how clades broke into newer clades. This includes Holozoa.

Despite already making his senior début earlier in the year, Rashford was called up to the England under-21 team for the first time in August 2016 for a fixture in September against Norway under-21s. He scored a hat-trick in the 6–1 home victory over Norway in his only appearance for the team, scoring the third with a penalty, his first since turning professional. Under-21 manager Gareth Southgate praised Rashford for his humility in dropping down to under-21 level.

Despite having already made his senior tournament début, it was expected Rashford would be available for selection for the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, with the hopes of gaining more tournament experience. United manager José Mourinho responded to these reports by stating it would make no sense for his development as he was already playing senior football. In April 2017, Mourinho appeared to concede Rashford would attend the tournament, saying he had no right to stop him from participating, but later in the month reiterated his opinion that dropping down wouldn't make sense, with Rashford having gained so much senior experience throughout the season. In May, Rashford made the decision not to go to the tournament, and was instead selected for the senior squad by Southgate, the new manager. Southgate praised the decisions taken by United coaching staff in helping maximise the potential of Rashford by not allowing him exposure at youth level for England, saying his development had been handled well by all parties.

Rashford has teamed up with poverty and food waste charity FareShare to provide meals to poor schoolchildren in the Greater Manchester area. Because of COVID-19 related lockdowns, schoolchildren were not receiving free school meals during this time. Eventually, the charity was able to raise enough money to reach four million children across the country. 

On 15 June 2020, Rashford wrote an open letter calling for the UK government to end child poverty. Bowing to the building pressure, the government extended free school meals for children during summer holidays. On 1 September, Rashford collaborated with multiple parties to create Child Food Poverty Task Force to help further this cause. In October, Rashford was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire.

Floppotron

The Floppotron is a musical instrument. It was made by Polish engineer Paweł Zadrożniak. It is made of a set of computer hardware that plays music together. The latest version, the Floppotron 2.0, has 64 floppy drives, eight hard drives, and two flatbed scanners.

The first version of the Floppotron was made in 2011. It is made of two floppy drives and an ATMega microcontroller. The sound is made by the magnetic head being moved by its stepper motor. The floppy drive's heads have be moved at the correct speed to make the correct sound.

The instrument became well known thanks to a video of the instrument on YouTube playing the Imperial March, which has more than 6 million views.

In 2016, Paweł Zadrożniak made a better version of the Floppotron, which has 64 floppy drives, 8 hard drives, and two flatbed scanners. Every column of eight floppy drives is controlled by an ATMega16 microcontroller, and the hard drives are controlled by two SMD MOSFETs that push and pull. The flatbed scanner head are controlled by Arduino Uno boards.

Any device that has an electric motor can make sound. Scanners and floppy drives use stepper motors to move the head with sensors that scan an image, or read or write, onto a magnetic disk. The faster the motor, the higher the pitch of the sound the motor makes. Hard disks use a magnet and a coil to tilt the head. When voltage is supplied for long enough, the head speeds up and hits the bound, which makes the "drum hit” sound.

The Floppotron makes MIDI music files into commands that tell each device when to buzz, click, or be silent.

As of April 2019, Paweł Zadrożniak's YouTube page shows more than one hundred songs played with the Floppotron. Some of those songs are Queen's "Bohemian Rapsody", Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit", White Stripes's "Seven Nation Army", Eurythmics' "Sweet Dreams" and Michael Jackson's "Thriller".

Intellivision Amico

The Intellivision Amico is a video game console made by Intellivision Entertainment. The console was revealed in October 2018 and pre-orders started in April 2019. The console will come out on April 15, 2021, delayed from October 10, 2020, along with 40 games being made for then.

Most games will be 2D or 2.5D. Other games will be 3D games the company thinks are easy to play and learn. The company helps studios make games for the console with whatever the studios need. All games will have features they will only have on the console. All games will be rated E (Everyone) or E10+ (Everyone 10+) by the ESRB, or PEGI 3 or PEGI 7 by PEGI. Intellivision Entertainment plan to release new games, motion control games, card games and other tabletop games, educational games, and updated classic video games, such as some Intellivision games, some from Imagic, and Atari and arcade games, of which "Moon Patrol" and "BurgerTime" will come out at about the same time as the console. Some Intellivision compilations will have licenses from third-parties, such as "". Games can be downloaded for $9.99 or less when the console comes out, later a higher amount less than $40, or from an RFID card for US$20 to US$30. All games can be played by one player or, because the goal of the system is to go back to family gaming and co-op with people in the same place because the company thinks modern gaming and web-based multiplayer has gone away from that, up to eight players locally. Online multiplayer is planned for a later date.

In May 2018, Tommy Tallarico said he planned to make a new Intellivision console, and made a new company, Intellivision Entertainment, becoming the president of it. Intellivision Productions started to name itself Blue Sky Rangers Inc. instead, and Intellivision Entertainment got the video game things they owned instead.

At the Portland Retro Gaming Expo in October 2018, the Intellivision Amico was officially revealed, such as its name, and the fact it would come out on October 10, 2020. Developer kits were expected to go out in Summer 2019.

In May 2019, Intellivision Entertainment announced its first major game exclusive to the console, a third official Earthworm Jim game, and that it got ten people who helped to work on the original "Earthworm Jim" team to work on it, all for Earthworm Jim's 25th anniversary. In June 2019, the Intellivision Amico could first be used in secret at E3 2019, allowing people with influence in the video game industry to play games in development on consoles, and try using the official mobile app that allowed mobile phones to be controllers for the console.

At Gamescom in Cologne, Germany in August 2019, Tommy Tallarico showed a trailer with footage of video games running on the Intellivision Amico to the public for the first time. In October 2019, Tommy Tallarico came to Insomnia Dubai, a gaming convention held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to say they set up an office in Dubai to make the Intellivision Amico come out in the MENA region on October 10, 2020, the same day as in North America and Europe.

The console has Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, RFID, HDMI out, an SD card slot, and three USB ports. Two of those USB ports can be used for charging, and the remaining USB port allows the console to store more data. There is a LED ambient lighting system built into the body that can change pattern and color in response to gameplay. This system is known as Interactive Guidance Lighting. This feature is intended to make playing games on the console "fun and memorable" while also helping guide players in an interactive way.

The Intellivision Amico comes with two controllers. They can charge wirelessly when they are placed into their cradle, which is on top of the console, charge using a wired USB-C connection, or charge in both ways at the same time. They have Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, RFID, speakers, a microphone, an accelerometer, force feedback and a gyroscope. They also have a full-color touch screen, four big shoulder buttons, a home button and a 64-way pressure-sensitive directional disc with a ring of LEDs all around it. The controllers come with wrist straps so they do not fly away during game action if they are not held in a secure way. Up to six more controllers can connect to the Intellivision Amico. A smartphone running a free controller smartphone app can be used instead of an Amico controller.

Tommy Tallarico, who is the president of Intellivision Entertainment, has said the games that will be available for the Intellivision Amico will be about 20% updated and re-imagined versions of classic video games, 20% original new games, 20% sports and recreation, 20% board games, dice games, card games, word games and puzzle games, and 20% educational games. All games will be both single player and multiplayer, with some games allowing up to eight players to play the game at the same time using controllers and/or mobile phones. Some games will have motion controls, using the accelerometer and gyroscope of the controller. Some games will have the Karma Gaming Engine, a feature that is intended to give players of all skill levels a fair level of competition against each other by always changing the difficulty for players based on how well they are doing in the game. Five games will come with the Intellivision Amico, and it will have about forty more games available when it comes out. Five of the six included games have been announced to be "Skiing", "Astrosmash", "Shark! Shark!", "Cornhole", and "Farkle".

These games have been announced to come out for the Intellivision Amico:

The Intellivision Amico runs an operating system that is based on Android and Linux only made by the company. In an interview with GamesBeat, Tommy Tallarico said the operating system is "very solid", but "very flexible", saying Linux is the "flexible" part and Android is the "solid" part.

Hallo aus Berlin

Hallo aus Berlin (English: Hello from Berlin) is a British educational television miniseries made by the BBC and the Goethe-Institut working together. It is used in German lessons in the United Kingdom, United States, Sweden, Hungary, Poland, the Netherlands and Australia. The 10 episodes in the series were shown on BBC Schools TV from 19 September 1996. It shows things that have happened, people are asked questions about themselves, energetic music, and animated parts, all like how a magazine would do so. The series is designed for people who are anywhere from 11 years old to 14 years old who are beginning to learn German.

The main characters are Marko Walther, Jessica König, Daniel Augustin, Esther Walk, Thomas Lindel, and Miriam Casten. They are young people who say what life is like in Berlin for them every day. Every episode has an animated sketch and song the host characters, Rolli und Rita, perform.

The episodes can be watched on YouTube or the BBC website.

The characters of the series talk about themselves for the first time. This includes what they look like, their heights and their ages. Rolli und Rita appear for the first time.

Some people who live in Berlin are asked questions about themselves. Thomas visits the Berlin Zoo and talks about the different animals that are seen there for the first time. The Rolli und Rita sketch shows Rita with a snake at Rolli's house that can solve problems using mathematics. The snake becomes confused and wrecks the room after Rolli asks it a question it finds hard to solve. Rolli und Rita then try to put the broken family portraits together again, incorrectly matching pieces with different family members. Nada, a 17-year-old who lives without his parents in a flat with other young people, talks about himself for the first time, and he talks about the chores and jobs he does when he is there. Rolli und Rita perform the song 'Das ist meine Familie'.

Marko talks about what his house is like. Miriam has breakfast with her family and talks about food that is usually eaten in a meal of breakfast. Some people who live in Berlin are asked questions about themselves.

Thomas meets someone who also enjoys Star Trek at a shop, and they leave the shop together. Wolfgang cannot find the correct way and asks someone who also lives in Berlin for help, only to get a long set of directions. The Rolli und Rita sketch shows Rita trying to talk to Rolli using a mobile phone multiple times and giving him directions that conflict with previous directions, until he accidentally finds out he is on top of a building that's being made. Thomas and his friend buy food, and Daniel, Miriam, Marko and Esther are asked how to find the correct way in Berlin. Wolfgang still cannot find his way and calls Jessica again, and she comes to meet him. Rolli und Rita perform the song "Ist eine Post hier?". Thomas, his friend, Jessica and Wolfgang are seen at the Cup Final match.

Thomas goes to a grocery shop to buy things for his favourite aunt. At the same time, Miriam and Jessica plan to go to McDonald's. Thomas and his aunt go to a cafe to get an ice cream and cake. Rolli und Rita try to make food at home. This goes wrong when Rita covers the room with whipped cream. A Turkish market and some traditional Turkish food are seen. Rolli und Rita perform the song "Einmal Eis, bitte".

Jessica and Marko talk about their schools, and multiple lessons can be seen. Things that are being done when it is lunch break are shown. Arno is found out to be smoking at too early of an age and is sent to the headteacher's office. Because of this, Arno is made to clean for the school as a punishment. At the same time, an English lesson is seen. The Rolli und Rita sketch shows Rolli not doing his homework. Rita appears on a computer screen that is near to him to help him, but both of them run away after he chooses all of the wrong answers.

The last episode of the series shows much of the culture in Berlin. Jessica goes around the shops of Berlin and the KaDeWe. Thomas talks about the history of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, a reminder of World War 2, and Daniel eats in a restaurant that is in Berlin. Esther talks about where she lives, Kreuzberg, and looks around its shops and restaurants. Marko talks about the history of the Berlin Wall, and talks about the plans for Potsdamer Platz to be constructed on that were new at the time. The characters say goodbye in a theme park. Rolli und Rita perform the song 'Das ist unser Berlin', which ends the series.

Rolli und Rita are two characters who are teenagers and are animated using computers. In every episode of the series, they appear in a sketch and perform a song.

The characters were said to be the most advanced ones when the series was first shown in 1996. Baxter Hobbins Slides, which was independent, used 3D motion-capture suits with motion sensors to make animated 3D models so the characters could make the same movements as the actors. These 3D models were wireframe models at first, then skin and clothes were added to them. The lip movements of the characters were done by using the real lip movements of the actors filmed behind a blue screen.

The voices in the sketches were later replaced with a version in French for "Quinze Minutes Plus" as "Juju et Juliette", and a version in Spanish for "Revista" as "Julio y Julia". 

The characters (mostly Rolli) and the music videos for 'Wann Hast Du Geburtstag?' and ‘Was Ist Dein Lieblingsfach?’ later became a small meme, due to Rolli's dance movements being very big.

Rolli was voiced by Frido Ruth. Rita was voiced by Nina Hamm, except for the singing parts, which were voiced by Christina Fry, a professional actress, singer, voice-over artist, comedienne, writer, presenter and cabaretist.

Singleton, New South Wales

Glide (API)

Glide is a 3D graphics API made by 3dfx Interactive for their "Voodoo Graphics" 3D accelerator cards. It was proprietary at first, then 3dfx later made it open source. It was only designed to draw graphics, mostly geometry and texture mapping, in data formats like those used in their cards. It was popular in the late 1990s because 3Dfx 3D accelerator cards were widely used, but became obsolete because Microsoft's Direct3D got better, full OpenGL implementations from other graphics card vendors came out, and 3D hardware became more diverse.

Glide is based on the basic geometry and "world view" of OpenGL 1.1. That version of OpenGL is an API that has 336 calls, most of which were not of use to draw graphics for video games at the time. Glide was designed to only have the features that were of use to draw graphics for video games at the time. The allowed the API to be small enough to fully run using late-1990s hardware.

Voodoo cards dominated the video game market during the last half of the 1990s because they ran fast and Glide was easy to use. The name Glide was chosen to reference OpenGL, which it was based on, while being different enough to not make trademark problems happen. 

Glide emulator development started in the late 1990s. Before 3dfx ended, the company tried very hard to stop these attempts, ending early emulation projects using legal threats. Before it ended and Nvidia bought its assets, 3dfx made the Glide API, and also the Voodoo 2 and Voodoo 3 specifications, open source. It later became an open source project. No games released after 1999 only support Glide for 3D acceleration (Direct3D and OpenGL are used instead), but Glide emulation is still needed to run older games with hardware acceleration. Because the specifications and code are now open source, multiple emulators and wrappers are available that allow older games that use the Glide API to run on non-Voodoo hardware. Other projects, such as Glidos, allow even older games to use Glide.

Dwarf Fortress

Dwarf Fortress (also known as Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress) is an indie game created by Tarn and Zach Adams. It has three modes, each providing a different experience but all sharing a fantasy setting. It is currently in Alpha, and has been in development since 2002. The game has simple text-based graphics inspired by classic roguelikes. There is no way to win, but various ways of losing an in-game fortress or adventurer. A popular meme within the game's fanbase is "Losing is fun!"

Before the game can be played, a world must be made. The player can choose the size, number of groups, and various other bits of the world. After this, they are shown a world made to their liking and can use it or ask for another.

In "Fortress Mode", the player manages a fortress of dwarves. Among other things, the player is able to construct buildings, build an army, and break holes. Their dwarves must be fed, entertained, and protected from hazards to survive. Hazards include flooding, sieges, magma, and a variety of hostile creatures.

In "Adventure Mode", the player explores the world as their own character. Through exploration, they can gather information on characters and places across the map. Quests can be discovered by listening to friendly NPCs. Most quests focus around killing villains or monsters, and reward fame. Some friendly NPCs can be made into companions, who will aid the player in their travels. The player character has the same needs as the dwarves, including hydration and rest. This mode features a deeper combat system where body parts can be targeted.

In "Legends Mode", the player can read the generated history of their world. Historical figures, artifacts, and battles are described. A historical map of the world is included.

In their youth, the Adams brothers were avid fans of sci-fi and fantasy games. They became curious about computer game development and Tarn worked to learn programming. The two programmed various computer games including "Slaves to Armok: God of Blood", a role-playing game focused around killing goblins. Using much of the system created for "Armok" and inspiration from their mining game "Mutant Miner", they began work on "Dwarf Fortress" in 2002. The game has been in development since 2006, with frequent updates on progress and planned features. The game is free to download and its development is funded through PayPal donations.

Rob Rensenbrink

Rob Rensenbrink (; 3 July 1947 – 24 January 2020) was a Dutch footballer and member of the Netherlands national team that reached two World Cup finals in 1974 and 1978. A creative and prolific left winger or forward, he became a legend in Belgium whilst playing in the great Anderlecht side of the 1970s. He is the UEFA Cup Winners Cup's all-time top scorer, with 25 goals. A talented dribbler as well as a cool finisher and adequate passer, he only ever missed two penalties in his entire career. He was also the first winner of the Onze d'Or. Considered as one of the greatest Dutch players of all time. Rensenbrink was widely regarded to be one of the best left wingers of the 1970s.

Born in Amsterdam, Rensenbrink started his career at DWS, an Amsterdam amateur club, before moving to Belgian side Club Brugge in 1969. Between 1971 and 1980 he played for Anderlecht where he enjoyed his greatest club successes. In total when in Belgium he twice won the Belgian Championships, the Belgian Cup five times and at European club level the European Cup Winners' Cup twice (in 1976 and 1978 as well as being runner-up in 1977). Rensenbrink delivered a notable performance in the 1976 final as Anderlecht ran out 4–2 winners against West Ham United. He scored two goals, one from the penalty spot and set up Francois Van der Elst for the fourth goal. Among his team mates was Dutch internationalist compatriot, Arie Haan. In 1980, he left Anderlecht and wound down his career with a spell at Portland Timbers in the NASL, followed by a brief stay with Toulouse in France in 1981.
Rensenbrink made his international debut for the Netherlands national football team against Scotland in 1968, but picked up relatively few caps due to competition for the forward positions with Johan Cruijff and Piet Keizer. However, Rinus Michels included him for the 1974 FIFA World Cup squad that made the short trip to West Germany.

The Dutch side that took part in the 1974 FIFA World Cup were the pinnacle of Total Football. Most of the 1974 team were made up of players from Ajax and Feyenoord, so Rensenbrink was an outsider and was unfamiliar with playing the system. His preferred position was up front on the left, but that position was already Johan Cruijff's domain, so he played on the left-wing position in midfield, taking over from Ajax player Piet Keizer. He missed one game in the tournament (when Keizer played instead) and was only half-fit for the final after picking up an injury during the semi-final against Brazil. Rinus Michels gambled on Rensenbrink's fitness and played him from start – however he only lasted until half-time and was replaced by René van de Kerkhof. The Netherlands took an early lead through a Johan Neeskens penalty, but goals from Paul Breitner and Gerd Müller gave West Germany a 2–1 victory. Rensenbrink's performances saw him named to the team of the tournament and he was sought by Ajax as a replacement for Keizer. However, contract negotiations fell through and he remained at Anderlecht.

Rensenbrink stayed in the Netherlands national team during the qualifiers and finals of the 1976 European Football Championship. However, the Netherlands fell at the semi-final stage to Czechoslovakia.

In the 1978 FIFA World Cup tournament in Argentina, the Netherlands again reached the final, but this time without Cruijff (who decided to retire from international football) and under the guidance of Ernst Happel rather than Michels. Out of the shadow of Cruijff, Rensenbrink found more room to showcase his own considerable talent, playing on the left-hand side of a front three alongside Johnny Rep and René van de Kerkhof. He scored a hat-trick in the opening game against Iran, another goal against Scotland which was goal number 1000 in World Cup history and a penalty in the 5–1 win over Austria. In the final against Argentina, the Netherlands yet again met the hosts. In an intense match, the Netherlands fell behind to a first-half Mario Kempes strike. After Dick Nanninga's equalizer 9 minutes from time, a long pass from the Dutch captain Ruud Krol in the last 30 seconds of normal time gave Rensenbrink a half-chance to score but his shot from a very narrow angle was deflected on to the post and bounced clear. Had he scored, it is almost certain that Holland would have won the World Cup with Rensenbrink being top goal scorer with Mario Kempes. Argentina scored twice in extra-time for a 3–1 victory and the Netherlands again had to settle for the runners-up spot.

Rensenbrink played some of the qualifiers for Euro 80, but after earning his 46th cap in 1979 (a 2–0 defeat by Poland in a qualifier for Euro 80), he retired from international football at the age of 32, having scored 14 times for his country. He along with Eusébio are the only players to score the most goals from a penalty spot in a tournament (4 in 1978).

He was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. He was also named Anderlecht's greatest ever foreign player in 2008.

Rensenbrink was married and lived in Oostzaan. In the summer of 2015, he revealed that he had been diagnosed with progressive muscular atrophy three years earlier. He died on 24 January 2020. Belgian news sources reported that he had been diagnosed with a muscular disease in 2012 which led to his death.

Harmonic series (mathematics)

In mathematics, the harmonic series is the divergent infinite series:

Divergent means that as you add more terms the sum never stops getting bigger. It does not go towards a single finite value.

Infinite means that you can always add another term. There is no final term to the series.

Its name comes from the idea of harmonics in music: the wavelengths of the overtones of a vibrating string are formula_2, formula_3, formula_4, etc., of the string's fundamental wavelength. Apart from the first term, every term of the series is the harmonic mean of the terms either side of it. The phrase "harmonic mean" also comes from music.

The fact that the harmonic series diverges was first proven in the 14th century by Nicole Oresme, but was forgotten. Proofs were given in the 17th century by Pietro Mengoli, Johann Bernoulli, and Jacob Bernoulli.

Harmonic sequences have been used by architects. In the Baroque period architects used them in the proportions of floor plans, elevations, and in the relationships between architectural details of churches and palaces.

There are several well-known proofs of the divergence of the harmonic series. A few of them are given below.

One way to prove divergence is to compare the harmonic series with another divergent series, where each denominator is replaced with the next-largest power of two:

Each term of the harmonic series is greater than or equal to the corresponding term of the second series, and therefore the sum of the harmonic series must be greater than or equal to the sum of the second series. However, the sum of the second series is infinite:

It follows (by the comparison test) that the sum of the harmonic series must be infinite as well. More precisely, the comparison above proves that

for every positive integer formula_8.

This proof, proposed by Nicole Oresme in around 1350, is considered to be a high point of medieval mathematics. It is still a standard proof taught in mathematics classes today.

It is possible to prove that the harmonic series diverges by comparing its sum with an improper integral. Consider the arrangement of rectangles shown in the figure to the right. Each rectangle is 1 unit wide and formula_9 units high, so the total area of the infinite number of rectangles is the sum of the harmonic series:

The total area under the curve formula_11 from 1 to infinity is given by a divergent improper integral:

Since this area is entirely contained within the rectangles, the total area of the rectangles must be infinite as well. This proves that

The generalization of this argument is known as the integral test.

The harmonic series diverges very slowly. For example, the sum of the first 10 terms is less than 100. This is because the partial sums of the series have logarithmic growth. In particular,
where formula_15 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant and formula_16 which approaches 0 as formula_8 goes to infinity. Leonhard Euler proved both this and also that the sum which includes only the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges also diverges, that is:

The finite partial sums of the diverging harmonic series,

are called harmonic numbers.

The difference between formula_20 and formula_21 formula_22 converges to the Euler–Mascheroni constant. The difference between any two harmonic numbers is never an integer. No harmonic numbers are integers, except for formula_23.

The series

is known as the alternating harmonic series. This series converges by the alternating series test. In particular, the sum is equal to the natural logarithm of 2:

The alternating harmonic series, while conditionally convergent, is not absolutely convergent: if the terms in the series are systematically rearranged, in general the sum becomes different and, dependent on the rearrangement, possibly even infinite.

The alternating harmonic series formula is a special case of the Mercator series, the Taylor series for the natural logarithm.

A related series can be derived from the Taylor series for the arctangent:

This is known as the Leibniz series.

The general harmonic series is of the form

where formula_28 and formula_29 are real numbers, and formula_30 is not zero or a negative integer.

By the limit comparison test with the harmonic series, all general harmonic series also diverge.

A generalization of the harmonic series is the formula_31-series (or hyperharmonic series), defined as

for any real number formula_31. When formula_34, the formula_31-series is the harmonic series, which diverges. Either the integral test or the Cauchy condensation test shows that the formula_31-series converges for all formula_37 (in which case it is called the over-harmonic series) and diverges for all formula_38. If formula_37 then the sum of the formula_31-series is formula_41, i.e., the Riemann zeta function evaluated at formula_31.

The problem of finding the sum for formula_43 is called the Basel problem; Leonhard Euler showed it is formula_44. The value of the sum for formula_45 is called Apéry's constant, since Roger Apéry proved that it is an irrational number.

Related to the formula_31-series is the ln-series, defined as

for any positive real number formula_31. This can be shown by the integral test to diverge for formula_38 but converge for all formula_37.

For any convex, real-valued function formula_51 such that

the series

is convergent.

The random harmonic series

where the formula_55 are independent, identically distributed random variables taking the values +1 and −1 with equal probability formula_2, is a well-known example in probability theory for a series of random variables that converges with probability 1. The fact of this convergence is an easy consequence of either the Kolmogorov three-series theorem or of the closely related Kolmogorov maximal inequality. Byron Schmuland of the University of Alberta further examined the properties of the random harmonic series, and showed that the convergent series is a random variable with some interesting properties. In particular, the probability density function of this random variable evaluated at +2 or at −2 takes on the value ..., differing from formula_57 by less than 10. Schmuland's paper explains why this probability is so close to, but not exactly, formula_57. The exact value of this probability is given by the infinite cosine product integral formula_59 divided by .

The depleted harmonic series where all of the terms in which the digit 9 appears anywhere in the denominator are removed can be shown to converge and its value is less than 80. In fact, when all the terms containing any particular string of digits (in any base) are removed the series converges.

The harmonic series can be counterintuitive. This is because it is a divergent series even though the terms of the series get smaller and go towards zero. The divergence of the harmonic series is the source of some paradoxes. 


Because the series gets arbitrarily large as formula_22 becomes larger, eventually this ratio must exceed 1, which implies that the worm reaches the end of the rubber band. However, the value of formula_22 at which this occurs must be extremely large: approximately formula_64, a number exceeding 10 minutes (10 years). Although the harmonic series does diverge, it does so very slowly.



Calculating the sum shows that the time required to get to the speed of light is only 97 seconds.

Fluminense de Feira Futebol Clube

Fluminense de Feira Futebol Clube, usually known as Fluminense de Feira, or just Fluminense are a Brazilian football team from Feira de Santana, Bahia, Brazil, founded on January 1, 1941.

Games are played in the Joia da Princesa stadium, capacity 16,274. The team plays in white, red and green striped shirts, white shorts and white socks.

On January 1, 1941, Fluminense de Feira Futebol Clube was founded. Fluminense de Feira became a professional team in 1954. Two years later, the club was runner-up in Campeonato Baiano. In 1963, the club won Campeonato Baiano, its first professional title. In 1968, the club was again Campeonato Baiano runner-up. In the following year, the club won again the state championship.

In 1992, Fluminense de Feira was runner-up of Brazilian Third Division, after losing the final to Tuna Luso. But, no promotion was given to Fluminense de Feira or Tuna Luso, because neither the second division, nor the third division were disputed in 1993.

In 1998, after a very poor campaign, ending in 10th of 12 teams, the club was relegated to the Campeonato Baiano Second Division. In 1999, Fluminense de Feira competed in the Campeonato Baiano Second Division, ending the competition as runner-up, after a 1–1 home match draw, and a 0–0 away match draw against Colo-Colo of Ilhéus. The team gained promotion to the following year's Campeonato Baiano first division.



Fluminense de Feira's stadium is Estádio Joia da Princesa, built in 1953, with a maximum capacity of 16,274 people.

The club is named after Fluminense Football Club of Rio de Janeiro city. Fluminense de Feira's kit, as well as the club logo, are very similar to the Rio de Janeiro's Fluminense ones. The club's nickname, Touro do Sertão, means Backland's Bull. Fluminense de Feira's mascot is a bull.


Orsinian Tales

Orsinian Tales is a collection of eleven short stories by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin. Most of them happen in Le Guin's imaginary country called Orsinia.

Most of the stories do not share events or characters. All the stories are emotional personal events. Many are romantic. Larger political events such as wars and revolutions are happening in all of the stories. Le Guin writes about each person's right to his or her own thoughts and emotions. In the stories, Le Guin shows that these emotions should not be controlled by society, rules, or the State.

The stories are set in a fictional country somewhere in Central Europe. Stories happen between 1150-1965. "Orsinia"is in Le Guin's earliest writings, Le Guin invented Orsinia when she was a young adult learning to write. The names Orsinia and Ursula both come from the Latin word "ursus" meaning "bear" ("ursula" = diminutive of "ursa" "female bear"; "ursinus" = "bear-like"). Le Guin once said that since Orsinia was her own country it should have her name.

Social conservative

A social conservative is someone who supports right-wing politics on social issues. Examples of such issues are: opposition to abortion, homosexual marriage, and/or euthanasia, supporting capital punishment, and similar issues. They may or may not be conservative on other issues, such as taxes.

In the United States social conservatives tend to be in the Republican Party and are usually also Christian Conservatives. There are also Americans who are social conservatives for other reasons than religion. 

In Canada, social conservatives are known as the Blue Tories.

Some people, such as Mary Wollstonecraft, George Orwell, and Stephen Leacock, have supported left-wing politics on many issues. However, they were socially conservative on issues like abortion, for Wollstonecraft and Orwell, or feminism, for Leacock.

Blue Tory

A Blue Tory is a member of the Conservative Party of Canada who is a social conservatives. They are the opposite of the Red Tories.

Stephen Harper is sometimes called a Blue Tory.

Red Tory

Red Tories are members of the Conservative Party of Canada who support left-wing policies on issues like capital punishment, homosexual marriage and abortion but who are still conservative because they want low taxes and small government and have libertarian beliefs. 

The people in the Conservative Party of Canada who disagree with them are called Blue Tories. 

John Diefenbaker and Joe Clark were Canadian Prime Ministers who were Red Tories.

White Christmas (movie)

White Christmas is a 1954 American musical movie starring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, and Vera-Ellen. It was directed by Michael Curtiz. It was filmed in VistaVision and Technicolor. It has songs by Irving Berlin, including the title song, "White Christmas". This was a new version of the song sung by Crosby in the 1942 film "Holiday Inn".

The movie was produced and distributed by Paramount Pictures. It is notable for being the first to be released in VistaVision. This is a widescreen process developed by Paramount. It used twice the surface area of the then standard 35mm film. This large-area negative was used to yield finer-grained standard-sized 35mm prints.

The word "film" is sometimes used instead of "movie". They are the same thing.

The movie starts on Christmas Eve, 1944, somewhere in Europe. It is World War II. Crosby and Kaye play two U.S. Army soldiers. Crosby plays Captain Bob Wallace and Kaye plays Private First Class Phil Davis. Bob is a Broadway entertainer, Phil wants to be a professional entertainer. They perform "White Christmas". Their commanding officer, Major General Thomas F. Waverly is being relieved of his command. He arrives for the end of the show and says goodbye.

After the performance everyone is forced to take cover from an aerial bombing. A bomb knocks over a Wwall. Bob is too busy shouting orders to notice. Phil pushes him out of the way and injurs his arm. Bob later visits Phil at a field hospital and thanks him for saving his life. Phil shows Bob a duet he wrote and asks to perform with him back in New York City. Feeling obligated by Phil's heroism, Bob agrees.

After the war, Bob and Phil make it big in nightclubs, radio, and then on Broadway, eventually becoming successful producers. They mount their newest hit musical titled "Playing Around". The same day they receive a letter from "Freckle-Faced Haynes, the dog-faced boy," their mess sergeant from the war, asking them to look at an act that his two sisters are doing.
They go to the club to watch the "Sisters" act. Phil notices that Bob likes Betty, played by Rosemary Clooney. Phil likes her sister Judy, played by Vera-Ellen. Betty and Judy join Bob and Phil at their table. Phil dances with Judy. Phil and Judy hit it off. Bob and Betty do not get on. They have a minor argument about how Bob thinks that everyone has an "angle" in show business.

Judy and Betty are headed for the Columbia Inn in Pine Tree, Vermont, where they are booked to perform over the holidays. Due to a disagreement with their landlord the girls have to leave. Phil gives the sisters his and Bob's sleeping-room on the train. They delay the sheriff by imitating the girls' and sing their song, "Sisters". Bob and Phil board later and Bob is extremely upset that they have to stay up all night in the club car on their way to NYC. They are joined by Betty and Judy, who thank them profusely for the tickets and convince them to come with them to Pine Tree.

When the train arrives in Pine Tree, there isn't any snow. Bob and Phil discover that the inn is run by their former commanding officer, General Waverly. Waverly has invested all of his savings into the lodge. It is failing because there's no snow and no guests. To bring business to the inn, Bob and Phil bring the entire cast and crew of their musical "Playing Around". They add in Betty and Judy to the rehearsals. Bob and Betty's relationship blooms and they spend a good deal of time together.

Bob discovers the General's request to rejoin the army has been rejected. Bob calls Ed Harrison an old army buddy. Ed is now a successful variety show host. They arrange a televised invitation to all the men formerly under the command of the General to come to the inn on Christmas Eve as a surprise. Harrison suggests they put the show on national television to generate free advertising for Wallace and Davis. Bob insists that it must have nothing to do with their business.

Nosy housekeeper Emma Allen has been listening, but she has only heard the part about free advertising, not Bob's rejection of the idea. She thinks that her boss will be seen as a pitiable figure on TV and tells Betty. Betty is shocked. The misunderstanding causes Betty to ignore a baffled Bob. While this is happening, Judy becomes convinced that Betty will never take on a serious relationship until Judy is engaged or married. She pressures a reluctant Phil to announce a phony engagement, but the plan backfires when Betty abruptly departs for New York City to take a job offer.

After rehearsals are complete, Phil and Judy reveal to Bob that the engagement was phony. Bob still doesn't know the real reason Betty left. He goes to New York for "The Ed Harrison Show". He tries to convince Betty to come back. Bob sees Betty's new act and tells her the truth about the engagement. He is called away by Ed Harrison before he finds out what is really bothering her.

Back at the Inn, Phil fakes an injury to distract the General so he won't see the broadcast of Bob's announcement. In the broadcast, Bob invites veterans of the 151st Division to come to Pine Tree, Vermont, on Christmas Eve. Betty sees it on TV and realizes she was wrong. She returns to Pine Tree in time for the Christmas Eve show, but only tells Judy. The whole division comes into Pine Tree secretly. When the General enters the lodge, he is greeted by his former division, who sing a rousing chorus of "The Old Man". Just as the following song ends, the snow starts to fall.

In the finale, Bob and Betty declare their love for one another. So do Phil and Judy. The background of the set is removed to show the snow falling. Bob, Betty, Phil and Judy perform "White Christmas". Everyone raises a glass, and toasts, "May your days be merry and bright; and may all your Christmases be white."


All songs were written by Irving Berlin. The centerpiece of the film is the title song. This was first used in "Holiday Inn" where it won an Oscar for Best Original Song in 1942.

"Count Your Blessings" earned an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song.

The song "Snow" was originally written for "Call Me Madam" with the title "Free". The melody was kept but the lyrics were changed to be more appropriate for a Christmas movie.

The song "What Can You Do with a General?" was originally written for an un-produced project called "Stars on My Shoulders".

It was not possible to issue an "original soundtrack album" of the film, because Decca Records controlled the soundtrack rights, but Clooney was under exclusive contract with Columbia Records. Consequently, each company issued a separate "soundtrack recording": Decca issuing "Selections from Irving Berlin's White Christmas," while Columbia issued "Irving Berlin's White Christmas." On the former, the song "Sisters" and all of Clooney's vocal parts were recorded by Peggy Lee. On the latter, the song was sung by Rosemary Clooney and her own sister, Betty.

Crosby and Kaye recorded another Berlin song ("Santa Claus") for the opening WWII Christmas Eve show scene, but it was not used in the final film. Their recording of the song survives and can be found on the Bear Family Records 7-CD set called "Come On-A My House".

"White Christmas" was intended to reunite Crosby and Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Crosby and Astaire had previously co-starred in "Holiday Inn" (1942) – where the song "White Christmas" first appeared – and "Blue Skies" (1946). Astaire declined the project after reading the script and asked to be released from his contract with Paramount. Crosby also left the project shortly thereafter, to spend more time with his sons after the death of his wife, Dixie Lee. Near the end of January 1953, Crosby returned to the project, and Donald O'Connor was signed to replace Astaire. Just before shooting was to begin, O'Connor had to drop out due to illness and was replaced by Danny Kaye, who asked for and received a salary of $200,000 and 10% of the gross. Financially, the film was a partnership between Crosby and Irving Berlin, who shared half the profits, and Paramount, which got the other half.

A scene from the film featuring Crosby and Kaye was broadcast the year after the film's release, on Christmas Day 1955, in the final episode of the NBC TV show "Colgate Comedy Hour" (1950–1955).

Berlin suggested a movie based on his song in 1948. Paramount put up the $2 million budget and only took 30% of the proceeds.

Principal photography took place between September and December 1953. The film was the first to be shot using Paramount's new VistaVision process, with color by Technicolor. It was one of the first to feature the Perspecta directional sound system at limited engagements.

Bosley Crowther of "The New York Times" was not impressed: "...the use of VistaVision, which is another process of projecting on a wide, flat screen, has made it possible to endow "White Christmas" with a fine pictorial quality. The colors on the big screen are rich and luminous, the images are clear and sharp, and rapid movements are got without blurring—or very little—such as sometimes is seen on other large screens. Director Michael Curtiz has made his picture look good. It is too bad that it doesn't hit the eardrums and the funnybone with equal force."

"Variety" liked it: ""White Christmas" should be a natural at the box office, introducing as it does Paramount's new VistaVision system with such a hot combination as Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and an Irving Berlin score...Crosby and Kaye, along with VV, keep the entertainment going in this fancifully staged Robert Emmett Dolan production, clicking so well the teaming should call for a repeat...Certainly he "(Crosby)" has never had a more facile partner than Kaye against whom to bounce his misleading nonchalance."

"White Christmas" was enormously popular with audiences, earning $12 million in theatrical rentals – equal to $ today – making it the top moneymaker of 1954 by a wide margin and the highest-grossing musical film of all-time. Overall, the film grossed $30 million at the domestic box office.

There was a US theatrical re-release by Paramount in 1961.

"White Christmas" was released in the US on VHS in 1986 and again in 1997. The first US DVD release was in 2000. It was re-released in 2009, with a Blu-ray in 2010. There was a US issue 4-disc "Diamond Anniversary Edition" in 2014. This collection contains a Blu-ray with extras, two DVDs with the film and extras, and a fourth disc of Christmas songs on CD. These songs are performed individually by Crosby, Clooney, and Kaye.

A stage adaptation of the musical, titled "Irving Berlin's White Christmas" premiered in San Francisco in 2004 and has played in various venues in the US, such as Boston, Buffalo, Los Angeles, Detroit and Louisville.
The musical played a limited engagement on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre, from November 14, 2008 until January 4, 2009. The musical also toured the United Kingdom in 2006 - 2008. It headed to the Sunderland Empire in Sunderland from November 2010 to January 2011 after a successful earlier run in Manchester and has continued in various cities with a London West End run at the end of 2014.

Masked tree frog

The masked tree frog, New Granada cross-banded tree frog, Tarraco treefrog, or Central American smilisca ("Smilisca phaeota") is a frog that lives in Honduras, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Colombia. Scientists have seen it as high in the hills as 3300 meters above sea level.

This frog is called the masked tree frog because it has dark skin around its eyes so it looks like it is wearing a black mask. The black mask covers their eyes, which helps them hide from predators.

This frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. The frog sleeps on top of large leaves, in ferns, or inside rolled-up leaves. Scientists think this frog eats insects and other animals without spines. This frog can change color. It can be tan during the day and turn green at night.

The male frog sits next to a small pool of rainwater and sings "wrauk" for the females. The females lay 2000 eggs at a time, which float on the surface of the water. The tadpoles grow into frogs quickly before the rainwater dries up.

Makhnovshchina was established when Huliaipole was captured by Makhno's forces on 27 November 1918. Huliapole became the territory's de facto capital. The Ukrainian peasants refused to pay rent to the landowners and "...seized the estates and livestock of the pomeshchiks, kulaks, monasteries and State holdings: in so doing, they always set up local committees to manage these assets, with an eye to sharing them out among the various villages and communes."

Russian forces of the White movement under Anton Denikin occupied part of the region and formed a temporary government of Southern Russia in March 1920. In late March 1920, Denikin's forces were pushed back by Makno's forces and the Red Army. Makhnovshchina was disestablished in 1921 when Makhno and 77 of his men escaped.

Yummy (Justin Bieber song)

"Yummy" is a song by Canadian singer Justin Bieber. It was released on January 3, 2020, along with a lyric video through Def Jam Recordings as the lead single from his upcoming fifth studio album. The song is Bieber's first solo single to be released in three years. Upon its release, the song has received mostly mixed reception from critics: many praised its R&B production but most dismissed its lyrics. Its official music video was directed by Bardia Zeinali, which premiered on January 4, 2020. 

On December 23, 2019, Bieber teased the release by posting a picture of himself in front of a piano accompanied by two posts with the caption "tomorrow". On the following day, he announced the single through a trailer he uploaded to YouTube that shows him walking through an abandoned gas station. The trailer also serves as an announcement for his upcoming North American tour starting May 14, 2020, as well as a documentary covering "all different stories". About the upcoming music, Bieber stated that he feels like "this is different than the previous albums just because of where I'm at in my life".

"Yummy" is a "straightforward R&B number" that moves along on pop-trap beats. The song contains a "crisp bass line and plinking keyboards". Bieber sings the pre-chorus, while he hits his "signature falsetto" in the bridge. Bryan Rolli of "Forbes" magazine called the chorus "seductive", albeit "meaningless". The song is considered an ode to Bieber's wife Hailey Bieber.

"Yummy" received polarizing reviews from music critics, who complimented the "catchy" R&B production. They also criticized the "asinine" lyrical content.

Rania Aniftos of "Billboard" said "Yummy" brings back "the flirtatious Bieber we've missed and been waiting for", describing the chorus as "catchy". Bryan Rolli, a writer for "Forbes", said that Bieber "sings his heart out" on the song and noted although "the lyrics may not invite scholarly analysis ... Bieber sure does sound good singing them". Rolli concluded calling the song a "win, an inevitable chart smash" and opined that it is "sure to sound even better when 50,000 fans scream it every night on his upcoming tour". Mikael Wood from the "Los Angeles Times" described the song as "a lithe little R&B number that faintly recalls Ginuwine's mid-'90s classic "Pony" and basically three-and-a-half minutes of PG-13 sex talk seemingly directed at Hailey Baldwin". He stated that "though it's very cute, 'Yummy' feels awfully lightweight for a single that has as much hanging on it as this one does" and added that the song "loses much of its flavor after only a few spins".

"NME"s Sam Moore complimented the song's R&B production, who dismissed the lyrics. He termed as "failed expectations". He opined that the song's producers opted for "minimalism with their choice of instrumentation, melding airy keys with pop-trap beats with an evident view of creating something as universal as the likes of 'Hotline Bling' and Childish Gambino's 'Feels Like Summer'". Moore further wrote that Bieber's layered vocals and harmonies are "able to glide along rather effortlessly—it's just a shame he doesn't have more to say with them" and that Bieber's embrace of R&B "isn't a complete turn-off". "Pitchfork"s Eric Torres criticized the song for being "shamelessly engineered for the truncated attention span of TikTok" and "a bloodless shell of an R&B song crippled by asinine lyrics and a tired, syncopated backdrop". He further wrote that the song "plateaus as soon as it starts, never inching past the toddler-like repetition of 'yummy-yum' in its chorus". Brad Callas from "Complex" listed "Yummy" among the best new music of the week and said Bieber's "pivot back to R&B is refreshing for those who were fans of his slept-on 2013 project, "Journals"". Callas further remarked that the "silky vocals" is at times reminiscent of Bieber's 2016 collaboration with Post Malone, "Deja Vu".

The music video for "Yummy" was directed by Bardia Zeinali, which premiered on January 4, 2020. In the video, it portrays Bieber with pink hair at a dinner party in a fancy restaurant, eating various colorful food items with the guests.
